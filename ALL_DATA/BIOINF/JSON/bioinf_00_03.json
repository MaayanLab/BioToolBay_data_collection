The amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions based on the amino acid index profile of the primary sequence have been taken into account in the algorithms. We have analyzed 472 amino acid indices and selected the four amino acid indices as the examples, which have the best performance. Thus the five attribute parameter data sets (COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ) were established from the protein primary sequences. The COMP attribute data set is composed of amino acid composition, and the FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ attribute data sets are composed of the amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions of the corresponding amino acid residue index. The overall accuracies of SVM are 78.5, 87.5, 83.2, 81.7 and 81.9%, respectively, for COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ data sets in jackknife test, which are 19.6, 7.8, 15.5, 13.1 and 15.8%, respectively, higher than that of the covariant discriminant algorithm in the same test. The results show that SVM may be applied to discriminate between the primary sequences of homodimers and non-homodimers and the two protein sequence descriptors can reflect the quaternary structure information.

A connectivity structure\nconsisting of  four major subsets of metabolites and reactions,\ni.e. a fully connected  sub-network, a substrate subset, a\nproduct subset and an isolated subset is  found to exist in\nmetabolic networks of 65 fully sequenced organisms. The  largest\nfully connected part of a metabolic network, called \u2018the giant \nstrong component (GSC)\u2019, represents the most complicated part\nand the core  of the network and has the feature of scale-free\nnetworks. The average path  length of the whole network is\nprimarily determined by that of the GSC. For most  of the organisms,\nGSC normally contains less than one-third of the nodes of  the\nnetwork. This connectivity structure is very similar to the\u2018\nbow-tie\u2019  structure of World Wide Web.

Frequently, retronuons are\n exapted (co-opted) as regulatory elements that may alter expression\n or processing of targeted genes (Brosius and Gould, 1992, ", "Proc.\n Natl Acad. Sci. USA", " , ", "89", ", 10706\u201310710) (for\n compilations see ", "http://www-ifi.uni-muenster.de/exapted-retrogenes/tables.html)", ".\n Consequently, retronuons are a major driving force of evolution and\n perhaps even speciation. Comparison of the human genome with that of\n other mammals such as mouse or, in particular, chimpanzee reveals\n that neither contains numerous additional genes.

Proteins within a superfamily usually share the same\n  fold and possess related functions. These structural and functional\n  constraints are reflected in the alignment conservation patterns.\n  Positions of functional and/or structural importance tend to be more\n  conserved. Conserved positions are usually clustered in distinct\n  motifs surrounded by sequence segments of low conservation. Poorly\n  conserved regions might also arise from the imperfections in\n  multiple alignment algorithms and thus indicate possible alignment\n  errors. Quantification of conservation by attributing a conservation\n  index to each aligned position makes motif detection more\n  convenient. Mapping these conservation indices onto a protein\n  spatial structure helps to visualize spatial conservation features\n  of the molecule and to predict functionally and/or structurally\n  important sites. Analysis of conservation indices could be a useful\n  tool in detection of potentially misaligned regions and will aid in\n  improvement of multiple alignments.", "Results: We developed a program to calculate a conservation index\n  at each position in a multiple sequence alignment using several\n  methods. Namely, amino acid frequencies at each position are\n  estimated and the conservation index is calculated from these\n  frequencies. We utilize both unweighted frequencies and frequencies\n  weighted using two different strategies. Three conceptually\n  different approaches (entropy-based, variance-based and matrix\n  score-based) are implemented in the algorithm to define the\n  conservation index. Calculating conservation indices for 35522\n  positions in 284 alignments from SMART database we demonstrate that\n  different methods result in highly correlated (correlation\n  coefficient more than 0.85) conservation indices.

A key property of this\n  representation is that each cluster of the expression data\n  corresponds to one subtree of the MST, which rigorously converts a\n  multi-dimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem.\n  We have demonstrated that though the inter-data relationship is\n  greatly simplified in the MST representation, no essential\n  information is lost for the purpose of clustering. Two key\n  advantages in representing a set of multi-dimensional data as an MST\n  are: (1) the simple structure of a tree facilitates efficient\n  implementations of rigorous clustering algorithms, which otherwise\n  are highly computationally challenging; and (2) as an MST-based\n  clustering does not depend on detailed geometric shape of a cluster,\n  it can overcome many of the problems faced by classical clustering\n  algorithms. Based on the MST representation, we have developed a\n  number of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms, including\n  two with guaranteed global optimality.

We initially showed that robotic motion\nplanning permitted one to determine the energy of binding and\ndissociation of ligands from protein binding sites (Singh ", "et al.", ", 1999).\nThe robotic motion planning method maps complicated\nthree-dimensional conformational states into a much simpler, but\nhigher dimensional space in which conformational rearrangements\ncan be represented as linear paths.

SRS\npermits one to calculate contributions from all possible paths\nsimultaneously with far fewer energy calculations than Monte\nCarlo or molecular dynamics methods.

Grouping of sequences should\nreflect their evolutionary history and their functional\nproperties. Visualization of relationships between sequences is\nof no less importance.

The Euclidian space may\nbe projected in two or three dimensions and the projections can\nbe used to visualize relationships between proteins. On the\nthird step, we find a non-parametric estimate of the probability\ndensity of the points and cluster the points that belong to the\nsame local maximum of this density in a group.

The objective of the present study is to test the viability of the Bayesian network paradigm in a realistic simulation study.

In addition, the numerical method allows for\n  quantification of the differences and it provides results that are\n  general in a statistical sense.

Further, the corresponding marker genes identified through the unsupervised algorithm also have a strong biological relationship to the specific cancer class. The algorithm tested on leukemia microarray data, which contains three leukemia types, was able to determine three major and one minor cluster. Prediction models built for the four clusters indicate that the prediction strength for the smaller cluster is generally low, therefore labelled as uncertain cluster. Further analysis shows that the uncertain cluster can be subdivided further, and the subdivisions are related to two of the original clusters.

We developed and tested an algorithm that finds optimal matches between two families of proteins by comparing their distance matrices. A distance matrix provides a measure of the sequence similarity of proteins within a family. Since the protein sets of interest may have dozens of proteins each, the use of an efficient approximate solution is necessary. Therefore the approach we have developed consists of a ", "Metropolis Monte Carlo", " optimization algorithm which explores the search space of possible matches between two distance matrices.
