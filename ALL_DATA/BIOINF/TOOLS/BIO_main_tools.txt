0	http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASS	1	NULL	MASS	We present a novel method for multiple alignment of protein structures and detection of structural motifs. To date, only a few methods are available for addressing this task. Most of them are based on a series of pairwise comparisons. In contrast, MASS (MultipleAlignment bySecondaryStructures) considers all the given structures at the same time. Exploiting the secondary structure representation aids in filtering out noisy results and in making the method highly efficient and robust. MASS disregards the sequence order of the secondary structure elements. Thus, it can find non-sequential and even non-topological structural motifs. An important novel feature of MASS is subset alignment detection: It does not require that all the input molecules be aligned. Rather, MASS is capable of detecting structural motifs shared only by a subset of the molecules. Given its high efficiency and capability of detecting subset alignments, MASS is suitable for a broad range of challenging applications: It can handle large-scale protein ensembles (on the order of tens) that may be heterogeneous, noisy, topologically unrelated and contain structures of low resolution.Keywords: Structural Bioinformatics, Subset alignment, Non-sequential alignment, Non-topological motif, Supersecondary structural motifAvailability: MASS program and more information about it are available onhttp://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASSContact:oranit@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	3.0	4	1	639	1524	836	246	0.290313205762	0.288648778099	0.20776545552	0.187391724462	-1.11227884907	0.524346343282	2.41223038227	NULL	2.12993128182	-0.875348419638

7	http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html	8	NULL	Tricross	Motivation: The process of determining the functionalsequencecontent of an organism is confounded by several factors.Large protein coding sequences are relatively easy to find bystatistical methods. Smaller proteins however may escape detectiondue to their size falling below some arbitrary researcher-definedminimum cutoff, or the inability to precisely define a promoter, ortranslational start (Delcheret al.,Nucleic AcidsRes.,27, 4636–4641, 1999). Promoter andregulatory sequences themselves are difficult to define due to asignificant amount of allowable sequence variation, as well as aprobable lack of any completely accurate whole-organismal genecatalogs to date. Finally, certain genes coding functional RNAs mayhave insufficient structural or sequence constraints to bedetectable by normal sequence structure/pattern searching methods(Eddy and Rivas,Bioinformatics,16, 583–605,2000).In those cases where there are multiple closely relatedorganisms that have been sequenced, there is additional informationthat may be used in the investigation of sequence content—thatbeing the possible conserved nature of functional sequences betweenthe organisms.We present a method for the utilization of thisconserved information to detect genes and other potentiallyfunctional sequences that may be missed by standard ORF-calling, RNAfinding, and pattern matching software. Thetricrossprograms produce a multi-way cross comparison of three sets ofsequences, determine which are conserved in all three sets, andproduce a graphical (Virtual Reality Modelling Language—VRML;(ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997, VDC), 1997) representation as well asalignments of all sequence triples found. The software can also beapplied to a pair of sequence sets, though the noise in the resultsincreases.Results:Tricrosshas been used to examine theintergenic-sequence content of the three archaeal Pyrococcus genomesto determine the most highly related sequences remaining between theannotated protein and RNA coding sequences. Set to relativelystringent similarity requirements for the search,tricrossfound 101 intergenic sequences conserved among the three organisms.Interestingly, 29 of these appear to contain members of a family ofsmall RNA molecules (Kiss-Laszloet al.,EMBO J.,17, 797–807, 1998) only recently discovered in theArchaea (Armbruster, OSU, Diss., 1988; Omeret al.,Science,288, 517–522, 2000; Gaspinetal.,J. Mol. Biol.,297, 895–906,2000). While some of the remaining 72 appear to be individual highlyconserved promoter sequences, others have no currently knownbiological significance. Although originally developed to facilitatethe examination of intergenic sequences, none of thetricrosslogic is inherently specific to intergenicsequences. The software can also be applied to gene sequences, andhas been used to produce inter-genomic gene order dot-plots forHaemophilus influenzae (Fleischmannet al.,Science,269, 496–512, 1995) versus H.ducreyi(unpublished data), and Neisseria meningiditis Z2491 (serogroup A)(Parkhillet al.,Nature,404,502–506, 2000) versus Neisseria meningiditis Z58 (serogroup B)(Tettelinet al.,Science,287,1809–1815, 2000) versus Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Lewisetal.,http://micro-gen.ouhsc.edu/,2000).Availability: Thetricrosssoftware package is availablefromhttp://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html.Contact:ray@biosci.ohio-state.edu;daniels.7@osu.edu;munsonr@pediatrics.ohio-state.eduSupplementaryinformation: Additional data from the cross-genomic comparisonsexamined in the discussion section are linked fromhttp://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	0.0	4	8	240	2176	258	77	0.141614857775	0.13160653166	0.128184197487	0.124113263497	1.81605080349	-1.03402378345	0.585198281278	NULL	0.0507661237211	-2.22358602679

Given these complications,characterizing the effectiveness of different analysis techniques to uncovernetwork groups and structures remains a challenge. Generating simulatedexpression patterns with known biological features of expression complexity,diversity and interconnectivities provides a more controlled means ofinvestigating the appropriateness of different analysis methods.

However, no convenient tool is publicly available to carry outsuch analyses.Results: We developed STRUCLA (STRUcture CLAssification), a WWW tool forgeneration of trees based on evolutionary distances inferred from proteinstructures according to various methods. The server takes as an input a listof PDB files or the initial alignment of protein coordinates provided by theuser (for instance exported from SWISS PDB VIEWER). The user specifies the distance cutoff and selects the distance measures. The server returns seriesof unrooted trees in the NEXUS format and corresponding distance matrices,as well as a consensus tree.

PISCES can provide lists culled from the entirePDB or from lists of PDB entries or chains provided by the user. Thesequence identities are obtained from PSI-BLAST alignments withposition-specific substitution matrices derived from the non-redundantprotein sequence database. PISCES therefore provides better lists thanservers that use BLAST, which is unable to identify many relationships below40% sequence identity and often overestimates sequence identity byaligning only well-conserved fragments. PDB sequences are updated weekly.PISCES can also cull non-PDB sequences provided by the user as a list ofGenBank identifiers, a FASTA format file, or BLAST/PSI-BLAST output.Availability: The server is located athttp://www.fccc.edu/research/labs/dunbrack/piscesContact:rl_dunbrack@fccc.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	55.0	4	20	228	861	1527	398	0.207413657979	0.18964111324	0.189273136649	0.186041936591	-1.63723870159	-2.91709250474	-0.668944028341	NULL	0.857308630869	0.12940277826

It will allow researchers tocompare current and new models of sequence evolution across a large varietyof sequences. The large quantity of data may provide inspiration for newmodels and methodology to study sequence evolution and may allow generalstatements about the relative effect of different molecular processes onevolution.Results: The Pandit 7.6 database contains 4341 families of sequences derived from theseed alignments of the Pfam database of amino acid alignments of families ofhomologous protein domains (Batemanet al., 2002). Each family in Pandit includes an alignment of amino acid sequences that matches the correspondingPfam family seed alignment, an alignment of DNA sequences that contain thecoding sequence of the Pfam alignment when they can be recovered (overall,82.9% of sequences taken from Pfam) and the alignment of amino acidsequences restricted to only those sequences for which a DNA sequence couldbe recovered. Each of the alignments has an estimate of the phylogenetictree associated with it. The tree topologies were obtained using theneighbor joining method based on maximum likelihood estimates of theevolutionary distances, with branch lengths then calculated using a standardmaximum likelihood approach.Availability: The Pandit database is available for browsing and download via its home pageathttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/pandit/Contact:simon@ebi.ac.uk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2.0	4	22	999	1087	2140	330	0.261949833296	0.21425127449	0.209619912127	0.190910570157	2.349784312	-0.971520872322	0.0611797377084	NULL	1.10106986979	-1.40997825307

Their applications range from functional annotation to tissue classification and genetic network inference. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. This translates to the algorithmic problem of clustering genes based on their expression patterns.Results:We present a novel clustering algorithm, called CLICK, and its applications to gene expression analysis. The algorithm utilizes graph-theoretic and statistical techniques to identify tight groups (kernels) of highly similar elements, which are likely to belong to the same true cluster. Several heuristic procedures are then used to expand the kernels into the full clusters. We report on the application of CLICK to a variety of gene expression data sets. In all those applications it outperformed extant algorithms according to several common figures of merit. We also point out that CLICK can be successfully used for the identification of common regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of co-regulated genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CLICK can be used to accurately classify tissue samples into disease types, based on their expression profiles. Finally, we present a new java-based graphical tool, called EXPANDER, for gene expression analysis and visualization, which incorporates CLICK and several other popular clustering algorithms.Availability:http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~rshamir/expander/expander.html	13.0	4	27	1031	1104	194	888	0.241583631305	0.223813277252	0.2182440346	0.214645937362	-0.237574703902	-0.320363680192	-0.996802806347	NULL	-1.80396045586	0.497938312793

Pattern databases have becomevital tools for identifying distant relationships in sequences, andhence for predicting protein function and structure. The maindrawback of such methods is the relatively small representation ofproteins in trial samples at the time of their construction.Therefore, a negative result of an amino acid sequence comparisonwith such a databank forces a researcher to search for similaritiesin the original protein banks. We developed a database of patternsconstructed for groups of related proteins with maximumrepresentation of amino acid sequences of SWISS-PROT in thegroups.Results: Software tools and a new method have been designed toconstruct patterns of protein families. By using such method, a newversion of databank of protein family patterns, PROF_ PAT 1.3, isproduced. This bank is based on SWISS-PROT (r1.38) and TrEMBL(r1.11), and contains patterns of more than 13 000 groups of relatedproteins in a format similar to that of the PROSITE. Motifs ofpatterns, which had the minimum level of probability to be found inrandom sequences, were selected. Flexible fast search programaccompanies the bank. The researcher can specify a similarity matrix(the type PAM, BLOSUM and other). Variable levels of similarity canbe set (permitting search strategies ranging from exact matches toincreasing levels of ‘fuzziness’).Availability: The Internet address for comparing sequences withthe bank is:http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/prof_pat/.The local version of the bank and search programs (approximately 50Mb) is available via ftp:ftp://ftp.bionet.nsc.ru/pub/biology/vector/prof_pat/,andftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/prof_pat/.Another appropriate way for its external use is to mail amino acidsequences to bachin@vector.nsc.ru for comparison with PROF_ PAT1.3.Contact:bachin@vector.nsc.ru	1.0	4	53	1821	330	324	2442	0.184050774676	0.166964321595	0.137757372383	0.133020922453	-1.85969540991	0.467450988092	1.19637694936	NULL	1.77743455679	1.1523507651

60	http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.html	61	NULL	MaxSub	Motivation: Evaluating the accuracy of predicted models iscritical for assessing structure prediction methods. Because thisproblem is not trivial, a large number of different assessmentmeasures have been proposed by various authors, and it has alreadybecome an active subfield of research (Moultet al.(1999)Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction(CASP): round III.Proteins, Suppl32–6). TheCASP (Moultet al.(1997) Critical assessment of methods ofproteins structure prediction (CASP): round II.Proteins,Suppl3, Dedicated Issue, Moultet al.(1999)Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction(CASP): round III.Proteins, Suppl32–6) andCAFASP (Fischeret al.(1999) CAFASP-1: critical assessmentof fully automated structure prediction methods.Proteins,Suppl3, 209–217) prediction experiments havedemonstrated that it has been difficult to choose one single,‘best’ method to be used in the evaluation.Consequently, the CASP3 evaluation was carried out using anextensive set of especially developed numerical measures, coupledwith human-expert intervention. As part of our efforts towards ahigher level of automation in the structure prediction field, herewe investigate the suitability of a fully automated, simple,objective, quantitative and reproducible method that can be used inthe automatic assessment of models in the upcoming CAFASP2experiment. Such a method should (a) produce one single number thatmeasures the quality of a predicted model and (b) perform similarlyto human-expert evaluations.Results: MaxSub is a new and independently developed method thatfurther builds and extends some of the evaluation methods introducedat CASP3. MaxSub aims at identifying the largest subset ofCαCαC_{{\alpha}}atoms of a model that superimpose‘well’ over the experimental structure, and produces asingle normalized score that represents the quality of the model.Because there exists no evaluation method for assessment measures ofpredicted models, it is not easy to evaluate how good our newmeasure is. Even though an exact comparison of MaxSub and the CASP3assessment is not straightforward, here we use a test-bed extractedfrom the CASP3 fold-recognition models. A rough qualitativecomparison of the performance of MaxSub vis-a-vis the human-expertassessment carried out at CASP3 shows that there is a good agreementfor the more accurate models and for the better predicting groups.As expected, some differences were observed among the medium to poormodels and groups. Overall, the top six predicting groups rankedusing the fully automated MaxSub are also the top six groups rankedat CASP3. We conclude that MaxSub is a suitable method for theautomatic evaluation of models.Availability: MaxSub is available at:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.htmlContact: {nomsiew,dfischer}@cs.bgu.ac.il;arne@biokemi.su.se;leszek@iimcb.gov.plSupplementaryInformation: Full tables are available at:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/∼∼{\sim}dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.html CASPweb site:http://PredictionCenter.llnl.gov/casp3/CAFASPweb site:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/CAFASP2To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	13.0	4	57	1698	670	1393	1345	0.240649519703	0.219383415347	0.151985424577	0.151653564914	-0.626053730186	0.900550998728	3.45152378502	NULL	2.0543685673	-1.51811422087

Recent literature suggests that a better way to analysethe data would be to create random trees from the known phylogenythat are fully-resolved but consistent with the known tree. Acomputer program is presented, Fels-Rand, that performs suchanalyses. A randomisation procedure is used to generate trees thatare fully resolved but whose structure is consistent with theoriginal tree. Statistics are then calculated on a large number ofthese randomly-generated trees. Fels-Rand uses the object-orientedfeatures of Xlisp-Stat to manipulate internal tree representations.Xlisp-Stat’s dynamic graphing features are used to provideheuristic tools to aid in analysis, particularly outlier analysis.The usefulness of Xlisp-Stat as a system for phylogeneticcomputation is discussed.Availability: Available from the author or athttp://www.uq.edu.au/~ansblomb/Fels-Rand.sit.hqx.Xlisp-Stat is available fromhttp://stat.umn.edu/~luke/xls/xlsinfo/xlsinfo.html.Contact:s.blomberg@abdn.ac.uk	0.0	4	61	1026	2264	2161	126	0.221437132259	0.174777333658	0.154417647701	0.145811540295	2.67151521975	1.88782458319	-0.0660961467464	NULL	0.886364778314	-0.248344122647

83	http://mastr.binf.ku.dk/	84	NULL	MASTR	Motivation:As more non–coding RNAs are discovered, the importance of methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the structure of ncRNA is intimately tied to the function of the molecule, programs for RNA structure prediction are necessary tools in this growing field of research. Furthermore, it is known that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more conserved than sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and structure prediction.Result:We present a novel solution to the problem of simultaneous structure prediction and multiple alignment of RNA sequences. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a simulated annealing framework, the algorithmMASTR(MultipleAlignment ofSTructuralRNAs) iteratively improves both sequence alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA sequences. This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing probabilities. The results show that the method is very competitive to similar programs available today, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.Availability:Source code available fromhttp://mastr.binf.ku.dk/Contact:stinus@binf.ku.dk	4.0	4	77	2325	860	258	168	0.364368029076	0.35863125322	0.308465076198	0.280800255349	-1.32981735277	-0.566976779036	2.53195362994	NULL	0.202825954337	-2.2435833747

The evolution of recombinant sequences can not be properly explained by a single phylogenetic tree, but several phylogenies may be used to correctly model the evolution of non-recombinant fragments.Results:We developed a likelihood-based model selection procedure that uses a genetic algorithm to search multiple sequence alignments for evidence of recombination breakpoints and identify putative recombinant sequences. GARD is an extensible and intuitive method that can be run efficiently in parallel. Extensive simulation studies show that the method nearly always outperforms other available tools, both in terms of power and accuracy and that the use of GARD to screen sequences for recombination ensures good statistical properties for methods aimed at detecting positive selection.Availability:Freely availableContact:spond@ucsd.edu	20.0	4	78	309	605	817	1009	0.321250661531	0.259459031377	0.162353613018	0.160326861471	2.14520627549	1.61692500706	-1.37200838462	NULL	1.48329390759	0.0671218197205

94	http://www.oboedit.org	95	NULL	OBO	Motivation:Existing projects that focus on the semiautomatic addition of links between existing terms in the Open Biomedical Ontologies can take advantage of reasoners that can make new inferences between terms that are based on the added formal definitions and that reflect nonalignments between the linked terms. However, these projects require that these definitions be necessary and sufficient, a strong requirement that often does not hold. If such definitions cannot be added, the reasoners cannot point to the nonalignments through the suggestion of new inferences.Results:We describe a methodology by which we have identified over 1900 instances of nonredundant nonalignments between terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) ontologies, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and the Cell Type Ontology (CL). Many of the 39.8% of these nonalignments whose object terms are more atomic than the subject terms are not currently examined in other ontology-enrichment projects due to the fact that the necessary and sufficient conditions required for the inferences are not currently examined. Analysis of the ratios of nonalignments to assertions from which the nonalignments were identified suggests that BP–MF, BP–BP, BP–CL and CC–CC terms are relatively well-aligned, while ChEBI–MF, BP–ChEBI and CC–MF terms are relatively not aligned well. We propose four ways to resolve an identified nonalignment and recommend an analogous implementation of our methodology in ontology-enrichment tools to identify types of nonalignments that are currently not detected.Availability:The nonalignments discussed in this article may be viewed athttp://compbio.uchsc.edu/Hunter_lab/Bada/nonalignments_2008_03_06.html.

Crossing and comparing such heterogeneous and disparate data will help improving functional annotation of genomes. This requires designing elaborate integration systems such as warehouses for storing and querying these data.Results:We have designed a relational genomic warehouse with an original multi-layer architecture made of a databases layer and an entities layer. We describe a new querying module, GenoQuery, which is based on this architecture. We use the entities layer to define mixed queries. These mixed queries allow searching for instances of biological entities and their properties in the different databases, without specifying in which database they should be found. Accordingly, we further introduce the central notion of alternative queries. Such queries have the same meaning as the original mixed queries, while exploiting complementarities yielded by the various integrated databases of the warehouse.We explain how GenoQuery computes all the alternative queries of a given mixed query. We illustrate how useful this querying module is by means of a thorough example.Availability:http://www.lri.fr/~lemoine/GenoQuery/Contact:chris@lri.fr,lemoine@lri.fr	0.0	4	86	682	540	1777	615	0.231853307722	0.17583059816	0.16756616538	0.157654859231	0.514739771239	-1.71237296807	1.39759138777	NULL	-0.717755649191	2.04343722755

Existing significance-based algorithms consider an organism detected even if a significant number of the microarray probes that match the organism are called absent in a hybridization. Further, they do generate redundant results if the target organisms show high sequence similarity and the microarray probes cannot discriminate all of them.Results:We propose a new analysis strategy that considers organism similarities and calls organisms only present if the probes that match the organism but are absent in a hybridization can be explained by random events. In our strategy, we first identify the groups of target organisms that are actually distinguishable by the array. Subsequently, these organism groups are placed in a hierarchical tree such that groups matching only less specific probes are closer to the tree root, and groups that are discriminated only by few probes are close to each other.

The elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks is thus needed to understand the cell's working mechanism, and can for example, be useful for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level.Results:We propose SIRENE (Supervised Inference of Regulatory Networks), a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each transcription factor. SIRENE is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations inEscherichia coli, and show that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other state-of-the-art inference methods.Availability:All data and programs are freely available athttp://cbio.ensmp.fr/sirene.Contact:Fantine.Mordelet@ensmp.fr	6.0	4	103	2388	2251	163	753	0.282526469511	0.253509888889	0.232368439789	0.231072845489	0.419728542217	1.0661043275	0.571376403282	NULL	-0.115716552707	2.29131367796

Here, we present iFoldRNA, a novel web-based methodology for RNA structure prediction with near atomic resolution accuracy and analysis of RNA folding thermodynamics. iFoldRNA rapidly explores RNA conformations using discrete molecular dynamics simulations of input RNA sequences. Starting from simplified linear-chain conformations, RNA molecules (<50 nt) fold to native-like structures within half an hour of simulation, facilitating rapid RNA structure prediction. All-atom reconstruction of energetically stable conformations generates iFoldRNA predicted RNA structures. The predicted RNA structures are within 2–5 Å root mean squre deviations (RMSDs) from corresponding experimentally derived structures. RNA folding parameters including specific heat, contact maps, simulation trajectories, gyration radii, RMSDs from native state, fraction of native-like contacts are accessible from iFoldRNA.

121	http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynyang/poool	122	NULL	PoooL	Motivation:Pooling DNA is a cost-effective alternative to individual genotyping method. It is often used for initial screening in genome-wide association analysis. In some studies, large pools with sizes up to several hundreds were applied in order to significantly reduce genotyping cost. However, method for estimating haplotype frequencies from large DNA pools has not been available due to computational complexity involved.Methods:We propose a novel constrained EM algorithm, PoooL, to estimate frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes from DNA pools. A quantity called importance factor is introduced to measure the contribution of a haplotype to the likelihood. Under the assumption of asymptotic normality of the estimated allele frequencies and a system of linear constraints on haplotype frequencies the importance factor remains a constant in the iterative maximization process. The maximization problem in the EM algorithm is then formulated into a constrained maximum entropy model and solved by the improved iterative scaling method.Results:Simulation study shows that our algorithm can efficiently estimate haplotype frequencies from DNA pools with arbitrarily large sizes. The algorithm works equally well for large pools with sizes up to hundreds or thousands and for pools with sizes as small as one or two individuals. The computational complexity of the PoooL algorithm is independent of pool sizes, and the computational efficiency for large pools is thus substantially improved over existing estimating methods. Simulation results also show that the proposed method is robust to genotype errors and population admixture.Availability:http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynyang/pooolContact:zhanghan@mail.ustc.edu.cn;ynyang@ustc.edu.cn	1.0	4	109	1513	678	1001	1745	0.298812365754	0.256570310512	0.188600370767	0.163161150608	1.11244461289	0.85771916585	-2.26491371493	NULL	0.844702655985	0.514163805304

PuReD-MCL then clusters documents efficiently using the MCL graph clustering algorithm, which is based on graph flow simulation. This process allows users to analyse the results by highlighting important clues, and finally to visualize the clusters and all relevant information using an interactive graph layout algorithm, for instance BioLayout Express 3D.Results:The methodology was applied to two different datasets, previously used for the validation of the document clustering tool TextQuest. The first dataset involves the organismsEscherichia coliand yeast, whereas the second is related toDrosophiladevelopment.

Based on Tompa's benchmark study, the performance of currentde novomotif finders is far from satisfactory (with sensitivity ≤0.222 and precision ≤0.307). The same study also shows that no motif finder performs consistently well over all datasets. Hence, it is not clear which finder one should use for a given dataset. To address this issue, a class of algorithms called ensemble methods have been proposed. Though the existing ensemble methods overall perform better than stand-alone motif finders, the improvement gained is not substantial. Our study reveals that these methods do not fully exploit the information obtained from the results of individual finders, resulting in minor improvement in sensitivity and poor precision.Results:In this article, we identify several key observations on how to utilize the results from individual finders and design a novel ensemble method, MotifVoter, to predict the motifs and binding sites.

139	http://www.vardb.org/	140	NULL	varDB	Summary:Infectious diseases are a major threat to global public health and prosperity. The causative agents consist of a suite of pathogens, ranging from bacteria to viruses, including fungi, helminthes and protozoa. Although these organisms are extremely varied in their biological structure and interactions with the host, they share similar methods of evading the host immune system. Antigenic variation and drift are mechanisms by which pathogens change their exposed epitopes while maintaining protein function. Accordingly, these traits enable pathogens to establish chronic infections in the host. The varDB database was developed to serve as a central repository of protein and nucleotide sequences as well as associated features (e.g. field isolate data, clinical parameters, etc.) involved in antigenic variation. The data currently contained in varDB were mined from GenBank as well as multiple specialized data repositories (e.g. PlasmoDB, GiardiaDB). Family members and ortholog groups were identified using a hierarchical search strategy, including literature/author-based searches and HMM profiles. Included in the current release are>29 000 sequences from 39 gene families from 25 different pathogens. This resource will enable researchers to compare antigenic variation within and across taxa with the goal of identifying common mechanisms of pathogenicity to assist in the fight against a range of devastating diseases.Availability:varDB is freely accessible athttp://www.vardb.org/Contact:nelson@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp;goto@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	123	1991	1235	2285	1557	0.213651880948	0.206706301716	0.203592968048	0.116775199407	-1.3399692132	-1.58197911884	-1.0916011475	NULL	1.65263869209	2.29701361256

In addition, the cell behavior can be studied by modeling the cellular context.Results:We have implemented a Monte Carlo algorithm (DESHARKY) that finds a metabolic pathway from a target compound by exploring a database of enzymatic reactions. DESHARKY outputs a biochemical route to the host metabolism together with its impact in the cellular context by using mathematical models of the cell resources and metabolism. Furthermore, we provide the sequence of amino acids for the enzymes involved in the route closest phylogenetically to the considered organism.

They are also useful as inputs to sequence analysis and modeling tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), which can be used to search for homology in databases of known protein structure. In addition, local structure predictions can be used as a component of cost functions in genetic algorithms that predict protein tertiary structure. We have developed a program (predict-2nd) that trains multilayer neural networks and have applied it to numerous local structure alphabets, tuning network parameters such as the number of layers, the number of units in each layer and the window sizes of each layer. We have had the most success with four-layer networks, with gradually increasing window sizes at each layer.Results:Because the four-layer neural nets occasionally get trapped in poor local optima, our training protocol now uses many different random starts, with short training runs, followed by more training on the best performing networks from the short runs. One recent addition to the program is the option to add a guide sequence to the profile inputs, increasing the number of inputs per position by 20. We find that use of a guide sequence provides a small but consistent improvement in the predictions for several different local-structure alphabets.Availability:Local structure prediction with the methods described here is available for use online athttp://www.soe.ucsc.edu/compbio/SAM_T08/T08-query.html.

Besides improving power for association mapping, GSEA-SNP may facilitate the identification of disease-associated SNPs and pathways, as well as the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.

Although the alignment problem has attracted considerable attention, preparation of high-quality alignments for distantly related sequences remains a difficult task.Results:We developed PROMALS, a multiple alignment method that shows promising results for protein homologs with sequence identity below 10%, aligning close to half of the amino acid residues correctly on average. This is about three times more accurate than traditional pairwise sequence alignment methods. PROMALS algorithm derives its strength from several sources: (i) sequence database searches to retrieve additional homologs; (ii) accurate secondary structure prediction; (iii) a hidden Markov model that uses a novel combined scoring of amino acids and secondary structures; (iv) probabilistic consistency-based scoring applied to progressive alignment of profiles. Compared to the best alignment methods that do not use secondary structure prediction and database searches (e.g. MUMMALS, ProbCons and MAFFT), PROMALS is up to 30% more accurate, with improvement being most prominent for highly divergent homologs.

Numerous studies have dealt with modeling the immunogenic pathway but not the intractable problem of immunogenicity prediction due to complex effects of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Moderate affinity of the MHC–peptide complex is essential to induce immune responses, but the relationship between the affinity and peptide immunogenicity is too weak to use for predicting immunogenicity. This study focuses on mining informative physicochemical properties from known experimental immunogenicity data to understand immune responses and predict immunogenicity of MHC-binding peptides accurately.Results:This study proposes a computational method to mine a feature set of informative physicochemical properties from MHC class I binding peptides to design a support vector machine (SVM) based system (named POPI) for the prediction of peptide immunogenicity. High performance of POPI arises mainly from an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm, which aims to automatically determine the best numbermout of 531 physicochemical properties, identify thesemproperties and tune SVM parameters simultaneously. The dataset consisting of 428 human MHC class I binding peptides belonging to four classes of immunogenicity was established from MHCPEP, a database of MHC-binding peptides (Brusicet al., 1998). POPI, utilizing them= 23 selected properties, performs well with the accuracy of 64.72% using leave-one-out cross-validation, compared with two sequence alignment-based prediction methods ALIGN (54.91%) and PSI-BLAST (53.23%).

One way to improve gene-finding accuracy in such genomes is to combine the exons predicted by several gene-finders, so that gene-finders that make uncorrelated errors can correct each other.Results:We present a method for combining gene-finders called Genomix. Genomix selects the predicted exons that are best conserved within and/or between species in terms of sequence and intron–exon structure, and combines them into a gene structure. Genomix was used to combine predictions from four gene-finders forCaenorhabditis elegans, by selecting the predicted exons that are best conserved withC.briggsaeandC.remanei. On a set of ∼1500 confirmedC.elegansgenes, Genomix increased the exon-level specificity by 10.1% and sensitivity by 2.7% compared to the best input gene-finder.Availability:Scripts and Supplementary Material can be found athttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/genomixContact:alc@sanger.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	160	122	1830	442	1232	0.264676240714	0.169481180222	0.161618607573	0.15949862775	-0.603346567369	-0.521312871758	-1.81837571282	NULL	0.0300222915144	0.521582884734

Currently published attributes are limited, the detailed mechanisms governing the disease association of a SAP remain unclear and thus, further investigation of new attributes and improvement of the prediction are desired.Results:A SAP dataset was compiled from the Swiss-Prot variant pages. We extracted and demonstrated the effectiveness of several new biologically informative attributes including the structural neighbor profiles that describe the SAP's microenvironment, nearby functional sites that measure the structure-based and sequence-based distances between the SAP site and its nearby functional sites, aggregation properties that measure the likelihood of protein aggregation and disordered regions that consider whether the SAP is located in structurally disordered regions. The new attributes provided insights into the mechanisms of the disease association of SAPs. We built a support vector machines (SVMs) classifier employing a carefully selected set of new and previously published attributes.

The accumulating large-scale measurements of gene knockout effects and molecular interactions allow us to begin to uncover regulatory and signaling pathways within the cell that connect causal to affected genes on a network of physical interactions.Results:We present a novel framework, SPINE, for Signaling-regulatory Pathway INferencE. The framework aims at explaining gene expression experiments in which a gene is knocked out and as a result multiple genes change their expression levels. To this end, an integrated network of protein–protein and protein-DNA interactions is constructed, and signaling pathways connecting the causal gene to the affected genes are searched for in this network. The reconstruction problem is translated into that of assigning an activation/repression attribute with each protein so as to explain (in expectation) a maximum number of the knockout effects observed. We provide an integer programming formulation for the latter problem and solve it using a commercial solver.We validate the method by applying it to a yeast subnetwork that is involved in mating. In cross-validation tests, SPINE obtains very high accuracy in predicting knockout effects (99%). Next, we apply SPINE to the entire yeast network to predict protein effects and reconstruct signaling and regulatory pathways. Overall, we are able to infer 861 paths with confidence and assign effects to 183 genes. The predicted effects are found to be in high agreement with current biological knowledge.Availability:The algorithm and data are available athttp://cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/SPINE.htmlContact:roded@post.tau.ac.il	4.0	4	163	1798	1240	418	103	0.280727087345	0.259406016012	0.259085352162	0.232368439789	-0.624388745803	0.83359158731	0.624095975221	NULL	0.061082495548	1.72098473584

191	http://www.ncrna.org/papers/Murlet/	192	NULL	Murlet	Motivation:Structural RNA genes exhibit unique evolutionary patterns that are designed to conserve their secondary structures; these patterns should be taken into account while constructing accurate multiple alignments of RNA genes. The Sankoff algorithm is a natural alignment algorithm that includes the effect of base-pair covariation in the alignment model. However, the extremely high computational cost of the Sankoff algorithm precludes its application to most RNA sequences.Results:We propose an efficient algorithm for the multiple alignment of structural RNA sequences. Our algorithm is a variant of the Sankoff algorithm, and it uses an efficient scoring system that reduces the time and space requirements considerably without compromising on the alignment quality. First, our algorithm computes the match probability matrix that measures the alignability of each position pair between sequences as well as the base pairing probability matrix for each sequence. These probabilities are then combined to score the alignment using the Sankoff algorithm. By itself, our algorithm does not predict the consensus secondary structure of the alignment but uses external programs for the prediction. We demonstrate that both the alignment quality and the accuracy of the consensus secondary structure prediction from our alignment are the highest among the other programs examined. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can align relatively long RNA sequences such as the eukaryotic-type signal recognition particle RNA that is ∼300 nt in length; multiple alignment of such sequences has not been possible by using other Sankoff-based algorithms.

That technology is based on the concept of a probe set. Individual probes within a probe set were originally designated by Affymetrix to hybridize with the same unique mRNA transcript. Because of increasing accuracy in knowledge of genomic sequences, however, a substantial number of the manufacturer's original probe groupings and mappings are now known to be inaccurate and must be corrected. Otherwise, analysis and interpretation of an Affymetrix microarray experiment will be in error.Results:AffyProbeMiner is a computationally efficient platform-independent tool that uses all RefSeq mature RNA protein coding transcripts and validated complete coding sequences in GenBank to (1) regroup the individual probes into consistent probe sets and (2) remap the probe sets to the correct sets of mRNA transcripts. The individual probes are grouped into probe sets that are ‘transcript-consistent’ in that they hybridize to the same mRNA transcript (or transcripts) and, therefore, measure the same entity (or entities). About 65.6 % of the probe sets on the HG-U133A chip were affected by the remapping. Pre-computed regrouped and remapped probe sets for many Affymetrix microarrays are made freely available at the AffyProbeMiner web site. Alternatively, we provide a web service that enables the user to perform the remapping for any type of short-oligo commercial or custom array that has an Affymetrix-format Chip Definition File (CDF).

Such regions might act as linkers between protein domains but often confer specific binding to various molecules; therefore, their characterization in terms of their boundaries and over-represented residues is important. Analysis of CBRs in a particular sequence can be time consuming if several types of biases have to be explored and their position visualized. Assessment of the significance of the detected CBRs can be approached by comparison to homologous protein sequences. To assist this procedure, we have developed BiasViz, a tool that allows to graphically studying local amino acid composition in protein sequences of a multiple sequence alignment.Availability:BiasViz java applet and source code can be accessed fromhttp://biasviz.sourceforge.netContact:matthuska@alumni.uwaterloo.ca	0.0	4	182	1744	1726	1259	1050	0.142084477306	0.138424777625	0.136484058755	0.13486328692	-2.85979548656	1.25349579322	2.03835800046	NULL	2.67603034029	-0.294840188318
208	http://www.geneontology.org/	209	NULL	Gene-Ontology	Motivation:High-throughput experiments such as microarray hybridizations often yield long lists of genes found to share a certain characteristic such as differential expression. Exploring Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of GO terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of GO because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem.Results:We present here a novel approach to analysis of GO term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. ROC analysis using study sets with overrepresented GO terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of GO term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core GO terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.Availability:The Ontologizer can be found at the project homepagehttp://www.charite.de/ch/medgen/ontologizerContact:peter.robinson@charite.deandvingron@molgen.mpg.de	14.0	4	183	957	630	336	450	0.582036791917	0.376977596437	0.304119372943	0.297999444457	1.41776096136	-1.16937727636	3.44523735247	NULL	-1.102499991	2.9723408517

Searching tandem mass spectra against sequence databases is the main analysis method nowadays. Since many peptide variations are possible, including them in the search space seems only logical. However, the search space usually grows exponentially with the number of independent variations and may therefore overwhelm computational resources.Results:We provide fast, cache-efficient search algorithms to screen large peptide search spaces including non-tryptic peptides, whole genomes, dozens of posttranslational modifications, unannotated point mutations and even unannotated splice sites. All these search spaces can be screened simultaneously. By optimizing the cache usage, we achieve a calculation speed that closely approaches the limits of the hardware. At the same time, we control the size of the overall search space by limiting the combinations of variations that can co-occur on the same peptide. Using a hypergeometric scoring scheme, we applied these algorithms to a dataset of 1 420 632 spectra. We were able to identify a considerable number of peptide variations within a modest amount of computing time on standard desktop computers.Availability:PepSplice is available as a C++ application for Linux, Windows and OSX atwww.ti.inf.ethz.ch/pw/software/pepsplice/.

A more general approach is proposed here, referred to as theSliding MinPDmethod, that reconstructs evolutionary networks for serially-sampled sequences in the presence of recombination.Results:Sliding MinPD combines distance-based phylogenetic methods with automated recombination detection based on the best-known sliding window approaches to reconstruct serial evolutionary networks. Its performance was evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies and was also applied to a set of serially-sampled HIV sequences from a single patient.

The server implements three different algorithms for epitope mapping: PepSurf, Mapitope, and a combination of the two. The rationale behind these algorithms is that the set of peptides mimics the genuine epitope in terms of physicochemical properties and spatial organization. When the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the antigen is known, the information in these peptides can be used to computationally infer the corresponding epitope. A user-friendly web interface and a graphical tool that allows viewing the predicted epitopes were developed.

About 75 000 of these reported variations cause an amino acid change in the translated protein. An important goal in genomic research is to understand how this variability affects protein function, and whether or not particular SNPs are associated to disease susceptibility. Accordingly, the SNPeffect database uses sequence- and structure-based bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of non-synonymous SNPs on the molecular phenotype of proteins. SNPeffect analyses the effect of SNPs on three categories of functional properties: (1) structural and thermodynamic properties affecting protein dynamics and stability (2) the integrity of functional and binding sites and (3) changes in posttranslational processing and cellular localization of proteins. The search interface of the database can be used to search specifically for polymorphisms that are predicted to cause a change in one of these properties. Now based on the Ensembl human databases, the SNPeffect database has been remodeled to better fit an automatically updatable structure.

224	http://contra.stanford.edu/contrafold/	225	NULL	CONTRAfold	Motivation:For several decades, free energy minimization methods have been the dominant strategy for single sequence RNA secondary structure prediction. More recently, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) have emerged as an alternative probabilistic methodology for modeling RNA structure. Unlike physics-based methods, which rely on thousands of experimentally-measured thermodynamic parameters, SCFGs use fully-automated statistical learning algorithms to derive model parameters. Despite this advantage, however, probabilistic methods have not replaced free energy minimization methods as the tool of choice for secondary structure prediction, as the accuracies of the best current SCFGs have yet to match those of the best physics-based models.Results:In this paper, we present CONTRAfold, a novel secondary structure prediction method based onconditional log-linear models(CLLMs), a flexible class of probabilistic models which generalize upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and feature-rich scoring. In a series of cross-validation experiments, we show that grammar-based secondary structure prediction methods formulated as CLLMs consistently outperform their SCFG analogs. Furthermore, CONTRAfold, a CLLM incorporating most of the features found in typical thermodynamic models, achieves the highest single sequence prediction accuracies to date, outperforming currently available probabilistic and physics-based techniques. Our result thus closes the gap between probabilistic and thermodynamic models, demonstrating that statistical learning procedures provide an effective alternative to empirical measurement of thermodynamic parameters for RNA secondary structure prediction.Availability:Source code for CONTRAfold is available at.Contact:chuongdo@cs.stanford.edu	16.0	4	198	2325	1847	1132	1524	0.320494154543	0.241428500861	0.234860291602	0.207040446561	-1.02438129179	-0.0620986187056	2.85490411828	NULL	1.39595598538	-1.84453134588
227	http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/bacello/	228	NULL	BaCelLo	Motivation.The knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein is fundamental for elucidating its function. It is difficult to determine the subcellular location for eukaryotic cells with experimental high-throughput procedures. Computational procedures are then needed for annotating the subcellular location of proteins in large scale genomic projects.Results.BaCelLo is a predictor for five classes of subcellular localization (secretory pathway, cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondrion and chloroplast) and it is based on different SVMs organized in a decision tree. The system exploits the information derived from the residue sequence and from the evolutionary information contained in alignment profiles. It analyzes the whole sequence composition and the compositions of both the N- and C-termini. The training set is curated in order to avoid redundancy. For the first time a balancing procedure is introduced in order to mitigate the effect of biased training sets. Three kingdom-specific predictors are implemented: for animals, plants and fungi, respectively. When distributing the proteins from animals and fungi into four classes, accuracy of BaCelLo reach 74% and 76%, respectively; a score of 67% is obtained when proteins from plants are distributed into five classes. BaCelLo outperforms the other presently available methods for the same task and gives more balanced accuracy and coverage values for each class. We also predict the subcellular localization of five whole proteomes,Homo sapiens,Mus musculus,Caenorhabditis elegans,Saccharomyces cerevisiaeandArabidopsis thaliana, comparing the protein content in each different compartment.Availability.BaCelLo can be accessed atContact.casadio@alma.unibo.it,andrea@biocomp.unibo.it,gigi@biocomp.unibo.it,piero@biocomp.unibo.it	11.0	4	199	315	1499	1219	1485	0.262654179072	0.190858178456	0.174908758946	0.173265321695	-2.40659880414	-0.577953649955	3.50844902294	NULL	2.84999169914	-1.18919113409

It is based on two aspects: (1) the analysis and simulation of boolean, kinetic and stochastic models and (2) the formalization of biological properties in temporal logic. BIOCHAM provides tools and languages for describing protein networks with a simple and straightforward syntax, and for integrating biological properties into the model. It then becomes possible to analyze, query, verify and maintain the model with respect to those properties. For kinetic models, BIOCHAM can search for appropriate parameter values in order to reproduce a specific behavior observed in experiments and formalized in temporal logic. Coupled with other methods such as bifurcation diagrams, this search assists the modeler/biologist in the modeling process.Availability:BIOCHAM (v. 2.5) is a free software available for download, with example models, atContact:Sylvain.Soliman@inria.fr	7.0	4	200	1132	1063	111	893	0.167576410847	0.159215790781	0.157895440734	0.154333975399	1.05950139565	0.685074501284	1.40760433993	NULL	-0.121297314298	1.42369113686

235	http://www.affymetrix.com/support/supplement/WGLRH_program.zip	236	NULL	WGLRH	Motivation:The identification of signatures of positive selection can provide important insights into recent evolutionary history in human populations. Current methods mostly rely on allele frequency determination or focus on one or a small number of candidate chromosomal regions per study. With the availability of large-scale genotype data, efficient approaches for an unbiased whole genome scan are becoming necessary.Methods:We have developed a new method, the whole genome long-range haplotype test (WGLRH), which uses genome-wide distributions to test for recent positive selection. Adapted from the long-range haplotype (LRH) test, the WGLRH test uses patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to identify regions with extremely low historic recombination. Common haplotypes with significantly longer than expected ranges of LD given their frequencies are identified as putative signatures of recent positive selection. In addition, we have also determined the ancestral alleles of SNPs by genotyping chimpanzee and gorilla DNA, and have identified SNPs where the non-ancestral alleles have risen to extremely high frequencies in human populations, termed ‘flipped SNPs’. Combining the haplotype test and the flipped SNPs determination, the WGLRH test serves as an unbiased genome-wide screen for regions under putative selection, and is potentially applicable to the study of other human populations.Results:Using WGLRH and high-density oligonucleotide arrays interrogating 116 204 SNPs, we rapidly identified putative regions of positive selection in three populations (Asian, Caucasian, African-American), and extended these observations to a fourth population, Yoruba, with data obtained from the International HapMap consortium. We mapped significant regions to annotated genes. While some regions overlap with genes previously suggested to be under positive selection, many of the genes have not been previously implicated in natural selection and offer intriguing possibilities for further study.Availability:the programs for the WGLRH algorithm are freely available and can be downloaded atContact:Giulia_Kennedy@affymetrix.comSupplementary Material:Three Supplementary tables	3.0	4	206	938	953	1090	1853	0.216976412441	0.21331241559	0.204837235598	0.193396151189	0.574972794551	1.71939169715	-1.51751594272	NULL	0.907978427476	1.01270075642

While traditional neighbor joining (NJ) remains a popular method for distance-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it suffers from a O(N3) time complexity, whereNrepresents the number of taxa in the input. Due to this steep asymptotic time complexity, NJ cannot reasonably handle very large datasets. In contrast, RNJ realizes a typical-case time complexity on the order of N2logN without any significant qualitative difference in output. RNJ is particularly useful when inferring a very large tree or a large number of trees. In addition, RNJ retains the desirable property that it will always reconstruct the true tree given a matrix of additive pairwise distances. Clearcut implements RNJ as a C program, which takes either a set of aligned sequences or a pre-computed distance matrix as input and produces a phylogenetic tree. Alternatively, Clearcut can reconstruct phylogenies using an extremely fast standard NJ implementation.Availability:Clearcut source code is available for download at:Contact:sheneman@hungry.comSupplementary information:	7.0	4	221	2264	29	1308	491	0.210483081941	0.157972631311	0.157691457722	0.143981055941	2.73602188812	1.70931235662	-0.0999266024795	NULL	0.938210218556	-0.274106934195

Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible ‘toolbox’ of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics.Results:We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis—TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups.Availability:The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

It also predicts as a further option the logarithm of the folding rate. To the best of our knowledge, the tool discriminates for the first time whether a protein is characterized by a two state or a multiple state kinetics, during the folding process, and concomitantly estimates also the value of the constant rate of the process.

The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability forde novosequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets.Availability:Contact:rwarren@bcgsc.ca	20.0	4	240	1833	1606	2451	747	0.271186409854	0.204965138185	0.187070617468	0.186594111934	1.96583964912	-0.810765768003	-2.31252455715	NULL	-0.453798181462	-2.46229498935

The spectrogram can display the general distribution of repetitive sequences while showing the repeat period, length and location without any prior knowledge.

280	http://genesilico.pl/meta/	281	NULL	I-Ssp6803I	Motivation:Restriction endonucleases (REases) and homing endonucleases (HEases) are biotechnologically important enzymes. Nearly all structurally characterized REases belong to the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily of nucleases, while most HEases belong to an unrelated LAGLIDADG superfamily. These two protein folds are typically associated with very different modes of protein-DNA recognition, consistent with the different mechanisms of action required to achieve high specificity. REases recognize short DNA sequences using multiple contacts per base pair, while HEases recognize very long sites using a few contacts per base pair, thereby allowing for partial degeneracy of the target sequence. Thus far, neither REases with the LAGLIDADG fold, nor HEases with the PD-(D/E)XK fold, have been found.Results:Using protein fold recognition, we have identified the first member of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily among homing endonucleases, a cyanobacterial enzyme I-Ssp6803I. We present a model of the I-Ssp6803I-DNA complex based on the structure of Type II restriction endonuclease R.BglI and predict the active site and residues involved in specific DNA sequence recognition by I-Ssp6803I. Our finding reveals a new unexpected evolutionary link between HEases and REases and suggests how PD-(D/E)XK nucleases may develop a ‘HEase-like’ way of interacting with the extended DNA sequence. This in turn may be exploited to study the evolution of DNA sequence specificity and to engineer nucleases with new substrate specificities.Contact:iamb@genesilico.pl	2.0	4	249	785	205	346	1975	0.228223408156	0.129987339449	0.126416891261	0.112352706985	-1.94208102302	0.636421985897	2.08817028767	NULL	2.07172321965	-0.673499111839

The workflow retrieves a list of publications, gene ontology annotations and nsSNP information for each gene involved in the biological pathway. Manual inspection of output data from several trial runs confirms that all expected information is appropriately retrieved by the workflow services. The use of an automated BioMoby workflow, rather than manual ‘surfing’, to retrieve the necessary data, significantly reduces the effort required for functional interpretation of SNP data, and thus encourages more speculative investigation.

The amount of such evidence continues to grow, but computational methods continue to have difficulty predicting genes when the evidence is conflicting or incomplete. Genome annotation pipelines collect a variety of types of evidence about gene structure and synthesize the results, which can then be refined further through manual, expert curation of gene models.Results:JIGSAW is a new gene finding system designed to automate the process of predicting gene structure from multiple sources of evidence, with results that often match the performance of human curators. JIGSAW computes the relative weight of different lines of evidence using statistics generated from a training set, and then combines the evidence using dynamic programming. Our results show that JIGSAW's performance is superior toab initiogene finding methods and to other pipelines such as Ensembl. Even without evidence from alignment to known genes, JIGSAW can substantially improve gene prediction accuracy as compared with existing methods.Availability:JIGSAW is available as an open source software package athttp://cbcb.umd.edu/software/jigsawContact:jeallen@umiacs.umd.edu	6.0	4	273	442	2280	1830	253	0.297515497074	0.160831020486	0.158751438844	0.156211677147	-0.727954320371	-0.992482324217	-1.92470964932	NULL	-1.00589666234	0.997353479381

The principal use of PCP in bioinformatics is design and evaluation of classifiers for use in clinical diagnostic tests based on measurements of gene expression. PCP implements leading pattern classification and gene selection algorithms and incorporates cross-validation estimation of classifier performance. Importantly, the implementation integrates gene selection and class prediction stages, which is vital for computing reliable performance estimates in small-sample scenarios. Additionally, the program includes automated and efficient model selection (optimization of parameters) for support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The distribution includes Linux and Windows/Cygwin binaries. The program can easily be ported to other platforms.Availability:Free download atContact:ljubomir@sfsu.edu	0.0	4	281	152	680	1652	789	0.210172849676	0.155203560867	0.154047109798	0.153200757178	-0.232862719437	2.12798210932	-0.74025298619	NULL	-1.63024514235	0.219977864723

We systematically test microscopic mechanisms to find the set of such mechanisms that optimally explain each networks' specific properties. In the first case we formulate a model including mainly random unbiased gene duplications and mutations. In the second case, the basic moves are website generation and rapid surf-induced link creation (/destruction). The different types of mechanisms reproduce the appropriate observed network properties. We use those to show that different kinds of networks have strongly system-dependent macroscopic experimental features. The diverging properties result from dissimilar node and link basic dynamics. The main non-uniform properties include the clustering coefficient, small-scale motifs frequency, time correlations, centrality and the connectivity of outgoing links. Some other features are generic such as the large-scale connectivity distribution of incoming links (scale-free) and the network diameter (small-worlds).

Until now, most researchers use pairwise distance comparisons algorithms, such as BLAST, COG, RBH, RSD and INPARANOID, to determine gene orthology. In contrast, orthology determination within a character-based phylogenetic framework has not been utilized on a genomic scale owing to the lack of efficiency and automation.Results:We have developed OrthologID, a Web application that automates the labor-intensive procedures of gene orthology determination within a character-based phylogenetic framework, thus making character-based orthology determination on a genomic scale possible. In addition to generating gene family trees and determining orthologous gene sets for complete genomes, OrthologID can also identify diagnostic characters that define each orthologous gene set, as well as diagnostic characters that are responsible for classifying query sequences from other genomes into specific orthology groups. The OrthologID database currently includes several complete plant genomes, includingArabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa,Populus trichocarpa, as well as a unicellular outgroup,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

338	http://cebs.niehs.nih.gov	339	NULL	CEBS	Motivation:The CEBS data repository is being developed to promote a systems biology approach to understand the biological effects of environmental stressors. CEBS will house data from multiple gene expression platforms (transcriptomics), protein expression and protein–protein interaction (proteomics), and changes in low molecular weight metabolite levels (metabolomics) aligned by their detailed toxicological context. The system will accommodate extensive complex querying in a user-friendly manner. CEBS will store toxicological contexts including the study design details, treatment protocols, animal characteristics and conventional toxicological endpoints such as histopathology findings and clinical chemistry measures. All of these data types can be integrated in a seamless fashion to enable data query and analysis in a biologically meaningful manner.Results:An object model, the SysBio-OM (Xirasagaret al., 2004) has been designed to facilitate the integration of microarray gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics data in the CEBS database system. We now report SysTox-OM as an open source systems toxicology model designed to integrate toxicological context into gene expression experiments. The SysTox-OM model is comprehensive and leverages other open source efforts, namely, the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data () which is a data standard for capturing toxicological information for animal studies and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium () that serves as a standard for the exchange of clinical data. Such standardization increases the accuracy of data mining, interpretation and exchange. The open source SysTox-OM model, which can be implemented on various software platforms, is presented here.Availability:A universal modeling language (UML) depiction of the entire SysTox-OM is available atand the Rational Rose object model package is distributed under an open source license that permits unrestricted academic and commercial use and is available at.

MIAME specifies the minimum information needed to describe a microarray experiment and the Microarray Gene Expression Object Model (MAGE-OM) and resulting MAGE-ML provide a mechanism to standardize data representation for data exchange, however a common terminology for data annotation is needed to support these standards.Results:Here we describe the MGED Ontology (MO) developed by the Ontology Working Group of the Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society. The MO provides terms for annotating all aspects of a microarray experiment from the design of the experiment and array layout, through to the preparation of the biological sample and the protocols used to hybridize the RNA and analyze the data. The MO was developed to provide terms for annotating experiments in line with the MIAME guidelines, i.e. to provide the semantics to describe a microarray experiment according to the concepts specified in MIAME. The MO does not attempt to incorporate terms from existing ontologies, e.g. those that deal with anatomical parts or developmental stages terms, but provides a framework to reference terms in other ontologies and therefore facilitates the use of ontologies in microarray data annotation.Availability:The MGED Ontology version.1.2.0 is available as a file in both DAML and OWL formats at.

The algorithm comes with an illustrative visualization tool for locating recombination breakpoints. We analyze the sequence alignment with respect to all choices of the parameter α weighting recombination cost against mutation cost. The analysis of the resulting cost curve yields additional information as to which sequence might be recombinant.

The algorithm utilizes Cap3 to perform an initial clustering of related EST sequences to produce a consensus sequence of a gene family. These consensus sequences are then used to collect all ESTs in the original EST library that are related using BLAST. A redundancy based criterion is applied to each EST to identify reliable unique gene-sequences. Using a highly inbred genome as a source of ESTs eliminates the necessity of computing covariance on each polymorphism to identify alleles of the same gene, thus making this algorithm more streamlined than other alternatives which must computationally attempt to distinguish genes from alleles.Availability:The programs were written in PERL and are freely available athttp://www.soybase.org/publication_data/Nelson/ESTminer/ESTminer.htmlContact:nelsonrt@iastate.eduSupplementary information:Figures and dataset can be obtained from:http://www.soybase.org/publication_data/Nelson/ESTminer/ESTminer.html	1.0	4	333	197	173	10	442	0.227934379664	0.14561003003	0.136324112809	0.1253847578	2.49146533376	-2.30910097131	1.20956548139	NULL	0.696590712114	-1.98270361725

Thus, there is an acute need for a tandem repeats database that provides reliable and up to date information on both perfect and imperfect tandem repeats in the human genome and relates these to disease genes.Results:This paper presents a web-accessible relational tandem repeats database that relates tandem repeats to gene locations and disease genes of the human genome. In contrast to other available databases, this database identifies both perfect and imperfect repeats of 1–2000 bp unit lengths. The utility of this database has been illustrated by analysing these repeats for their distribution and frequencies across chromosomes and genomic locations and between protein-coding and non-coding regions.

384	http://www.telis.ucla.edu	385	NULL	TELiS	Motivation:In microarray studies it is often of interest to identify upstream transcription control pathways mediating observed changes in gene expression. The Transcription Element Listening System (TELiS) combines sequence-based analysis of gene regulatory regions with statistical prevalence analyses to identify transcription-factor binding motifs (TFBMs) that are over-represented among the promoters of up- or down-regulated genes. Efficiency is maximized by decomposing the problem into two steps: (1) a priori compilation of prevalence matrices specifying the number of putative binding sites for a variety of transcription factors in promoters from all genes assayed by a given microarray, and (2) real-time statistical analysis of pre-compiled prevalence matrices to identify TFBMs that are over- or under-represented in promoters of differentially expressed genes. The interlocking JAVA applications namely, PromoterScan and PromoterStats carry out these tasks, and together constitute the TELiS database for reverse inference of transcription factor activity.Results:In two validation studies, TELiS accurately detectedin vivoactivation of NF-κB and the Type I interferon system by HIV-1 infection and pharmacologic activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The population-based statistical inference underlying TELiS out-performed conventional statistical tests in analytic sensitivity, with parametric studies demonstrating accurate identification of transcription factor activity from as few as 20 differentially expressed genes. TELiS thus provides a simple, rapid and sensitive tool for identifying transcription control pathways mediating observed gene expression dynamics.Availability:http://www.telis.ucla.eduContact:coles@ucla.edu	5.0	4	339	984	1082	1459	820	0.232959585438	0.203558032335	0.183367050231	0.18097589152	-0.0777665336153	1.46792041342	0.125768514716	NULL	-0.695866400387	0.328369613632

We obtain correlation coefficients close to 0.7 on yeast data and a sensitivity up to 74% on mammalian data, suggesting that the method is valid for eukaryotic NatA orthologs.Availability:The NetAcet prediction method is available as a public web server athttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetAcet/Contact:nikob@cbs.dtu.dkSupplementary information:http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetAcet/	4.0	4	343	144	1079	93	1642	0.366769901601	0.213723494488	0.199296730017	0.194239892637	0.0656999044779	2.21910433062	2.57135415825	NULL	2.9446252052	-0.123544932563

390	http://www.isima.fr/bioinfo/goarrays/	391	NULL	GoArrays	Motivation:The use of oligonucleotide microarray technology requires a very detailed attention to the design of specific probes spotted on the solid phase. These problems are far from being commonplace since they refer to complex physicochemical constraints. Whereas there are more and more publicly available programs for microarray oligonucleotide design, most of them use the same algorithm or criteria to design oligos, with only little variation.Results:We show that classical approaches used in oligo design software may be inefficient under certain experimental conditions, especially when dealing with complex target mixtures. Indeed, our biological model is a human obligate parasite, the microsporidiaEncephalitozoon cuniculi. Targets that are extracted from biological samples are composed of a mixture of pathogen transcripts and host cell transcripts. We propose a new approach to design oligonucleotides which combines good specificity with a potentially high sensitivity. This approach is original in the biological point of view as well as in the algorithmic point of view. We also present an experimental validation of this new strategy by comparing results obtained with standard oligos and with our composite oligos. A specificE.cuniculimicroarray will overcome the difficulty to discriminate the parasite mRNAs from the host cell mRNAs demonstrating the power of the microarray approach to elucidate the lifestyle of an intracellular pathogen using mix mRNAs.Availability:Our method is implemented in the GoArrays software, available athttp://www.isima.fr/bioinfo/goarrays/Contact:rimour@isima.frfor computing part, andpierre.peyret@univ-bpclermont.frfor collaborative projects.	4.0	4	345	1991	176	2285	210	0.151109866158	0.142804418829	0.126598035216	0.118371413946	-1.10463777159	-1.68692473006	-1.20636136883	NULL	1.40003492383	2.2591880937
391	http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il	392	NULL	ProtoNet	Motivation:Structural genomics projects aim to solve a large number of protein structures with the ultimate objective of representing the entire protein space. The computational challenge is to identify and prioritize a small set of proteins with new, currently unknown, superfamilies or folds.Results:We develop a method that assigns each protein a likelihood of it belonging to a new, yet undetermined, structural superfamily. The method relies on a variant of ProtoNet, an automatic hierarchical classification scheme of all protein sequences from SwissProt. Our results show that proteins that are remote from solved structures in the ProtoNet hierarchy are more likely to belong to new superfamilies. The results are validated against SCOP releases from recent years that account for about half of the solved structures known to date. We show that our new method and the representation of ProtoNet are superior in detecting new targets, compared to our previous method using ProtoMap classification. Furthermore, our method outperforms PSI-BLAST search in detecting potential new superfamilies.Availability:An interactive tool implementing this method, named ProTarget, is available athttp://www.protarget.cs.huji.ac.il.

Furthermore, exact HOR consensus lengths have not been reported so far. Given the fast growth of sequence databases in the centromeric region, it is of increasing interest to have efficient tools for computational identification and analysis of HORs from known sequences.Results:We develop a graphical user interface method, ColorHOR, for fast computational identification of HORs in a given genomic sequence, without requiring a priori information on the composition of the genomic sequence. ColorHOR is based on an extension of the key-string algorithm and provides a color representation of the order and orientation of HORs. For the key string, we use a robust 6 bp string from a consensus alpha satellite and its representative nature is tested. ColorHOR algorithm provides a direct visual identification of HORs (direct and/or reverse complement). In more detail, we first illustrate the ColorHOR results for human chromosome 1. Using ColorHOR we determine for the first time the HOR annotation of the GenBank sequence of the whole human genome. In addition to some HORs, corresponding to those determined previously biochemically, we find new HORs in chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19. For the first time, we determine exact consensus lengths of HORs in 10 chromosomes. We propose that the HOR assignment obtained by using ColorHOR be included into the GenBank database.Availability:The program with graphical user interface application for ColorHOR is freely available athttp://www.hazu.hr/KSA/colorHOR.html.

Restraints are generated from the information contained in structures of homologous template proteins. Employing the restraints generated by PERMOL, three-dimensional structures are obtained using MD programs such as DYANA or CNS. In contrast to other programs PERMOL is mainly based on the use of dihedral angle information which is optimally suited to preserve the local secondary structure. The global arrangement of these elements is then facilitated by a small number of distance restraints. Using PERMOL homology, models of high quality are obtained. A key advantage of the proposed method is its flexibility, which allows the inclusion of data from other sources, such as experimental restraints and the use of modern molecular dynamics programs to calculate structures.Availability:The software and a detailed manual are available free of charge (http://www.biologie.uni-regensburg.de/Biophysik/Kalbitzer/permol/permol.html)Contact:hans-robert.kalbitzer@biologie.uni-regensburg.de	0.0	4	352	844	760	282	2354	0.164678380121	0.135724670551	0.123095027666	0.122166862566	-0.444139958683	1.13708507603	2.24436814821	NULL	2.03726311965	-1.3075324963

Prediction methods can bridge this sequence–structure gap only partially. Better predictions of non-local contacts between residues could improve comparative modeling, fold recognition and could assist in the experimental structure determination.Results:Here, we introduced PROFcon, a novel contact prediction method that combines information from alignments, from predictions of secondary structure and solvent accessibility, from the region between two residues and from the average properties of the entire protein. In contrast to some other methods, PROFcon predicted short and long proteins at similar levels of accuracy. As expected, PROFcon was clearly less accurate when tested on sparse evolutionary profiles, that is, on families with few homologs. Prediction accuracy was highest for proteins belonging to the SCOP alpha/beta class. PROFcon compared favorably with state-of-the-art prediction methods at the CASP6 meeting. While the performance may still be perceived as low, our method clearly pushed the mark higher.

The computer scientists and the researchers of the local microarray laboratory considered alternative solutions for these five requirements and chose the following options: (i) use of automatic code generation; (ii) a customized data model based on standards; (iii) storage of datasets as black boxes instead of decomposing them in database tables; (iv) loosely linking to other programs for improved flexibility; and (v) a low-maintenance web-based user interface.

Two types of interaction are available from the pre-computed data: (1) interactions at the protein superfamily level and (2) those transferred from the interactions of yeast proteins. Interactions at the superfamily level were obtained by locating known structural interactions of the PDB in the SCOP domains and identifying homologs of the domains in the human proteins. Interactions transferred from yeast proteins were obtained by identifying homologs of the yeast proteins in the human proteins. For each human protein in the database and each query submitted by users, the protein superfamilies and yeast proteins assigned to the protein are shown, along with their interacting partners. We have also developed a set of web-based programs so that users can visualize and analyze protein interaction networks in order to explore the networks further.Availability:http://www.hpid.orgSupplementary information:http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/HPID/Statistics.htm	3.0	4	406	96	306	385	1638	0.348835036813	0.342942315144	0.335098055689	0.318403912608	-2.16514956345	1.35039272062	1.04683974982	NULL	2.35315368555	0.851400977605

We have previously developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for characterizing genetically divergent groups based on molecular markers and geographical sampling design of the dataset. However, for large-scale datasets such algorithms may get stuck to local maxima in the parameter space. Therefore, we have modified our earlier algorithm to support multiple parallel MCMC chains, with enhanced features that enable considerably faster and more reliable estimation compared to the earlier version of the algorithm. We consider also a hierarchical tree representation, from which a Bayesian model-averaged structure estimate can be extracted. The algorithm is implemented in a computer program that features a user-friendly interface and built-in graphics. The enhanced features are illustrated by analyses of simulated data and an extensive human molecular dataset.Availability:Freely available athttp://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~jic/bapspage.html	21.0	4	408	432	1092	126	2320	0.255880921503	0.208656712765	0.197793276353	0.188731441533	1.93100056218	2.63344814638	-0.190857894308	NULL	0.83495789897	0.272048754912

The main component of PaVESy (Pathway Visualization and Editing System) is a relational SQL database system. The database design allows storage of biological objects, such as metabolites, proteins, genes and respective relations, which are required to assemble metabolic and regulatory biological interactions. The database model accommodates highly flexible annotation of biological objects by user-defined attributes. In addition, specific roles of objects are derived from these attributes in the context of user-defined interactions, e.g. in the course of pathway generation or during editing of the database content. Furthermore, the user may organize and arrange the database content within a folder structure and is free to group and annotate database objects of interest within customizable subsets. Thus, we allow an individualized view on the database content and facilitate user customization. A JAVA-based class library was developed, which serves as the database programming interface to PaVESy. This API provides classes, which implement the concepts of object persistence in SQL databases, such as entries, interactions, annotations, folders and subsets. We created editing and visualization tools for navigation in and visualization of the database content. User approved pathway assemblies are stored and may be retrieved for continued modification, annotation and export.

465	http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/icbs/	466	NULL	ICBS	Motivation:Interchain β-sheet (ICBS) interactions occur widely in protein quaternary structures, interactions between proteins and protein aggregation. These interactions play a central role in many biological processes and in diseases ranging from AIDS and cancer to anthrax and Alzheimer's.Results:We have created a comprehensive database of ICBS interactions that is updated on a weekly basis and allows entries to be sorted and searched by relevance and other criteria through a simple Web interface. We derive a simple ICBS index to quantify the relative contributions of the β-ladders in the overall interchain interaction and compute first- and second-order statistics regarding amino acid composition and pairing at different relative positions in the β-strands. Analysis of the database reveals a 15.8% prevalence of significant ICBS interactions, the majority of which involve the formation of antiparallel β-sheets and many of which involve the formation of dimers and oligomers. The frequencies of amino acids in ICBS interfaces are similar to those in intrachain β-sheet interfaces. A full range of non-covalent interactions between side chains complement the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the main chains. Polar amino acids pair preferentially with polar amino acids and non-polar amino acids pair preferentially with non-polar amino acids among antiparallel (i, j) pairs. We anticipate that the statistics and insights gained from the database will guide the development of agents that control interchain β-sheet interactions and that the database will help identify new protein interactions and targets for these agents.Availability:The database is available at:http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/icbs/Supplementary Information:http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/icbs/	3.0	4	413	406	1050	222	330	0.203424775772	0.178701604594	0.170715839961	0.159426541251	-2.46181250163	1.32111853102	0.754091722114	NULL	2.34263893533	0.771581177486

475	http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/snoReport	476	NULL	SnoReport	Summary:Unlike tRNAs and microRNAs, both classes of snoRNAs, which direct two distinct types of chemical modifications of uracil residues, have proved to be surprisingly difficult to find in genomic sequences. Most computational approaches so far have explicitly used the fact that snoRNAs predominantly target ribosomal RNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. The target is specified by a short stretch of sequence complementarity between the snoRNA and its target. This sequence complementarity to known targets crucially contributes to sensitivity and specificity of snoRNA gene finding algorithms.The discovery of ‘orphan’ snoRNAs, which either have no known target, or which target ordinary protein-coding mRNAs, however, begs the question whether this class of ‘housekeeping’ non-coding RNAs is much more widespread and might have a diverse set of regulatory functions. In order to approach this question, we present here a combination of RNA secondary structure prediction and machine learning that is designed to recognize the two major classes of snoRNAs, box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, among ncRNA candidate sequences. ThesnoReportapproach deliberately avoids any usage of target information. We find that the combination of the conserved sequence boxes and secondary structure constraints as a pre-filter with SVM classifiers based on a small set of structural descriptors are sufficient for a reliable identification of snoRNAs.Tests ofsnoReporton data from several recent experimental surveys show that the approach is feasible; the application to a dataset from a large-scale comparative genomics survey for ncRNAs suggests that there are likely hundreds of previously undescribed ‘orphan’ snoRNAs still hidden in the human genome.Availability:ThesnoReportsoftware is implemented inANSI C.

482	http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/criticalpath/whitepaper.html#execsummary	483	NULL	FDA	Motivation:New efforts to guide and prioritize the selection of cancer drug targets are urgently needed, as is evident by the slow development of novel anti-cancer agents and the narrow therapeutic index of existing drugs. Given these limitations, the current study was conducted to explore the classification features defining the therapeutic success that can result from targeting a particular gene.Results:Classification was based on extracting features specific to known successful anti-cancer targets and combining them in a linear classifier, resulting in calculation of an enrichment score for each gene. Extended description, the search tool used in this study, enriched existing drug target candidates by up to 10-fold at an ∼50% recall rate, covering ∼24 000 genes or ∼80% of genome. More importantly, the target category with high attrition rate was classified from target category with low attrition rate, allowing to refine the drug development portfolios. Biological relevance of the parameters comprising the enrichment score was explored. Enrichment in cancer-specific effects was independently demonstrated by literature analysis. Imposing these enrichment scores on existing structural, pathway and phenotype-based procedures for prospective target selection may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of target identification and accelerate drug design.Availability:The software used in this work is available upon request.Contact:amayburd@cpaglobal.com,James_L_Mulshine@rush.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available atwww.mayburd.com;http://www.rush.edu/rumc/page-1120170920643.html	1.0	4	428	1522	1270	1288	2059	0.292690568565	0.273623665147	0.261255986727	0.25133663615	0.212375173021	-0.0766086156084	0.894286575707	NULL	0.577026164662	2.52780390349

Recently, there has been a growing need for computing these probabilities for long DNA sequences by constraining the maximal span of base pairs to a limited value. However, none of the existing programs can exactly compute the base pairing probabilities associated with the energy model of secondary structures under such a constraint.Results:We present an algorithm that exactly computes the base pairing probabilities associated with the energy model under the constraint on the maximal spanWof base pairs. The complexity of our algorithm is given byin time andin memory, whereNis the sequence length. We show that our algorithm has a higher sensitivity to the true base pairs as compared to that of RNAplfold. We also present an algorithm that predicts a mutually consistent set of local secondary structures by maximizing the expected accuracy function. The comparison of the local secondary structure predictions with those of RNALfold indicates that our algorithm is more accurate.

With the rise of systems biology, researchers need to concentrate on entire complex pathways that guide individual genes and related processes. Bioinformatics methods are needed to link the existing knowledge about pathways with the growing amounts of experimental data.Results:We present KEGGanim, a novel web-based tool for visualizing experimental data in biological pathways. KEGGanim produces animations and images of KEGG pathways using public or user uploaded high-throughput data. Pathway members are coloured according to experimental measurements, and animated over experimental conditions. KEGGanim visualization highlights dynamic changes over conditions and allows the user to observe important modules and key genes that influence the pathway. The simple user interface of KEGGanim provides options for filtering genes and experimental conditions.

486	http://ceb.scs.fsu.edu/awty	487	NULL	AWTY	Summary:A key element to a successful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is the programming and run performance of the Markov chain. However, the explicit use of quality assessments of the MCMC simulations—convergence diagnostics—in phylogenetics is still uncommon. Here, we present a simple tool that uses the output from MCMC simulations and visualizes a number of properties of primary interest in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, such as convergence rates of posterior split probabilities and branch lengths. Graphical exploration of the output from phylogenetic MCMC simulations gives intuitive and often crucial information on the success and reliability of the analysis. The tool presented here complements convergence diagnostics already available in other software packages primarily designed for other applications of MCMC. Importantly, the common practice of using trace-plots of a single parameter or summary statistic, such as the likelihood score of sampled trees, can be misleading for assessing the success of a phylogenetic MCMC simulation.Availability:The program is available as source under the GNU General Public License and as a web application athttp://ceb.scs.fsu.edu/awtyContact:jwilgenb@scs.fsu.edu	87.0	4	432	1092	408	2095	126	0.271519797021	0.255880921503	0.20642144431	0.164445480884	2.00412477842	2.58402671968	-0.172471753228	NULL	0.786985759778	0.213759553204

488	http://amos.sourceforge.net/Figaro	489	NULL	Figaro	Motivation:Sequences produced by automated Sanger sequencing machines frequently contain fragments of the cloning vector on their ends. Software tools currently available for identifying and removing the vector sequence require knowledge of the vector sequence, specific splice sites and any adapter sequences used in the experiment—information often omitted from public databases. Furthermore, the clipping coordinates themselves are missing or incorrectly reported. As an example, within the ∼1.24 billion shotgun sequences deposited in the NCBI Trace Archive, as many as ∼735 million (∼60%) lack vector clipping information. Correct clipping information is essential to scientists attempting to validate, improve and even finish the increasingly large number of genomes released at a ‘draft’ quality level.Results:We present here Figaro, a novel software tool for identifying and removing the vector from raw sequence data without prior knowledge of the vector sequence. The vector sequence is automatically inferred by analyzing the frequency of occurrence of short oligo-nucleotides using Poisson statistics. We show that Figaro achieves 99.98% sensitivity when tested on ∼1.5 million shotgun reads fromDrosophila pseudoobscura. We further explore the impact of accurate vector trimming on the quality of whole-genome assemblies by re-assembling two bacterial genomes from shotgun sequences deposited in the Trace Archive. Designed as a module in large computational pipelines, Figaro is fast, lightweight and flexible.Availability:Figaro is released under an open-source license through the AMOS package (http://amos.sourceforge.net/Figaro).Contact:mpop@umiacs.umd.edu	2.0	4	434	1377	240	1077	139	0.25249143696	0.17084116649	0.141588482957	0.137510879616	1.78470561515	0.617684266161	-3.33574605491	NULL	-0.587209329049	-1.92360871815

Since separate training data are not required (apart from the training sets used by individual gene finders), Evigan is particularly attractive for newly sequenced genomes where little or no reliable manually curated annotation is available.

503	http://www.sysbio.org/sysbio/networkbio/svm_hustle	504	NULL	SVM-HUSTLE—an	Motivation:As the amount of biological sequence data continues to grow exponentially we face the increasing challenge of assigning function to this enormous molecular ‘parts list’. The most popular approaches to this challenge make use of the simplifying assumption that similar functional molecules, or proteins, sometimes have similar composition, or sequence. However, these algorithms often fail to identifyremotehomologs (proteins with similar function but dissimilar sequence) which often are a significant fraction of the total homolog collection for a given sequence. We introduce a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based tool to detect homology using semi-supervised iterative learning (SVM-HUSTLE) that identifies significantly more remote homologs than current state-of-the-art sequence or cluster-based methods. As opposed to building profiles or position specific scoring matrices, SVM-HUSTLE builds an SVM classifier for a query sequence by training on a collection of representative high-confidence training sets, recruits additional sequences and assigns a statistical measure of homology between a pair of sequences. SVM-HUSTLE combines principles of semi-supervised learning theory with statistical sampling to create many concurrent classifiers to iteratively detect and refine, on-the-fly, patterns indicating homology.Results:When compared against existing methods for identifying protein homologs (BLAST, PSI-BLAST, COMPASS, PROF_SIM, RANKPROP and their variants) on two different benchmark datasets SVM-HUSTLE significantly outperforms each of the above methods using the most stringent ROC1statistic withP-values less than 1e-20. SVM-HUSTLE also yields results comparable to HHSearch but at a substantially reduced computational cost since we do not require the construction of HMMs.Availability:The software executable to run SVM-HUSTLE can be downloaded fromhttp://www.sysbio.org/sysbio/networkbio/svm_hustleContact:anuj.shah@pnl.gov	2.0	5	449	1659	152	1772	1068	0.235822168546	0.18540592047	0.148078187989	0.140283964544	0.832393133211	3.52867007886	-1.60624610965	NULL	-2.80304416272	0.301866016803

However, such repetitive sequences often do not have rigidly defined motifs. Consequently, the identification of these low-complexity repetitive elements has proven challenging for existing pattern-matching algorithms. Here we introduce a new web-tool SubSeqer (http://compsysbio.org/subseqer/) which uses graphical visualization methods borrowed from protein interaction studies to identify and characterize repetitive elements in low-complexity sequences.

However, in these methods, causative genes underlying a quantitative trait locus, or a disease, are usually located within a large genomic region or a large set of genes. Examining the function of every gene is very time consuming and needs to retrieve and integrate the information from multiple databases or genome resources. PGMapper is a software tool for automatically matching phenotype to genes from a defined genome region or a group of given genes by combining the mapping information from the Ensembl database and gene function information from the OMIM and PubMed databases.

518	http://www.eee.hku.hk/~cqchang/FastNCA.htm	519	NULL	FastNCA	Motivation:Recently developed network component analysis (NCA) approach is promising for gene regulatory network reconstruction from microarray data. The existing NCA algorithm is an iterative method which has two potential limitations: computational instability and multiple local solutions. The subsequently developed NCA-r algorithm with Tikhonov regularization can help solve the first issue but cannot completely handle the second one. Here we develop a novel Fast Network Component Analysis (FastNCA) algorithm which has an analytical solution that is much faster and does not have the above limitations.Results:Firstly FastNCA is compared to NCA and NCA-r using synthetic data. The reconstruction of FastNCA is more accurate than that of NCA-r and comparable to that of properly converged NCA. FastNCA is not sensitive to the correlation among the input signals, while its performance does degrade a little but not as dramatically as that of NCA. Like NCA, FastNCA is not very sensitive to small inaccuracies in a priori information on the network topology. FastNCA is about several tens times faster than NCA and several hundreds times faster than NCA-r. Then, the method is applied to real yeast cell-cycle microarray data. The activities of the estimated cell-cycle regulators by FastNCA and NCA-r are compared to the semi-quantitative results obtained independently by Leeet al. (2002). It is shown here that there is a greater agreement between the results of FastNCA and Lee's, which is represented by the ratio 23/33, than that between the results of NCA-r and Lee's, which is 14/33.Availability:Software and supplementary materials are available fromhttp://www.eee.hku.hk/~cqchang/FastNCA.htmContact:cqchang@eee.hku.hk	4.0	4	461	1973	966	226	1024	0.323775556815	0.073226832505	0.0702492872901	0.0701933988235	2.62131721775	2.13432537267	2.13241330803	NULL	2.13587300643	-1.72102680898

Due to its importance in regulating protein functions and cell signaling, a mass spectrometry-based proteomics method rapidly evolved to increase the dataset of experimentally determined SNO sites. However, there is currently no database dedicated to the integration of all experimentally verifiedS-nitrosylation sites with their structural or functional information. Thus, the dbSNO database is created to integrate all available datasets and to provide their structural analysis.

To solve the heterogeneity among the data collected from different sources, the sequence identity of these reportedS-nitrosylated peptides are mapped to the UniProtKB protein entries. To delineate the structural correlation and consensus motif of these SNO sites, the dbSNO database also provides structural and functional analyses, including the motifs of substrate sites, solvent accessibility, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein domains and gene ontology.Availability: The dbSNO is now freely accessible viahttp://dbSNO.mbc.nctu.edu.tw.

These measurements are essential in such applications as protein engineering, drug development, protein design and genome sequence analysis. Recently, high-throughput sequencing has been coupled to assays of protein activity, enabling the analysis of large numbers of mutations in parallel. We present Enrich, a tool for analyzing such deep mutational scanning data. Enrich identifies all unique variants (mutants) of a protein in high-throughput sequencing datasets and can correct for sequencing errors using overlapping paired-end reads. Enrich uses the frequency of each variant before and after selection to calculate an enrichment ratio, which is used to estimate fitness. Enrich provides an interactive interface to guide users. It generates user-accessible output for downstream analyses as well as several visualizations of the effects of mutation on function, thereby allowing the user to rapidly quantify and comprehend sequence–function relationships.Availability and Implementation:Enrich is implemented in Python and is available under a FreeBSD license athttp://depts.washington.edu/sfields/software/enrich/.

531	http://gmod.org	532	NULL	GMOD	Motivation:Next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the widespread use of -omic applications. As a result, there is now a pronounced bioinformatic bottleneck. The general model organism database (GMOD) tool kit (http://gmod.org) has produced a number of resources aimed at addressing this issue. It lacks, however, a robust online solution that can deploy heterogeneous data and software within a Web content management system (CMS).Results:We present a bioinformatic framework for the Drupal CMS. It consists of three modules. First, GMOD-DBSF is an application programming interface module for the Drupal CMS that simplifies the programming of bioinformatic Drupal modules. Second, the Drupal Bioinformatic Software Bench (biosoftware_bench) allows for a rapid and secure deployment of bioinformatic software. An innovative graphical user interface (GUI) guides both use and administration of the software, including the secure provision of pre-publication datasets. Third, we present genes4all_experiment, which exemplifies how our work supports the wider research community.Conclusion:Given the infrastructure presented here, the Drupal CMS may become a powerful new tool set for bioinformaticians. The GMOD-DBSF base module is an expandable community resource that decreases development time of Drupal modules for bioinformatics. The biosoftware_bench module can already enhance biologists' ability to mine their own data. The genes4all_experiment module has already been responsible for archiving of more than 150 studies of RNAi from Lepidoptera, which were previously unpublished.Availability and implementation:Implemented in PHP and Perl.

536	http://intersnp.meb.uni-bonn.de	537	NULL	INTERSNP	Summary:Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have lead to the identification of hundreds of genomic regions associated with complex diseases. Nevertheless, a large fraction of their heritability remains unexplained. Interaction between genetic variants is one of several putative explanations for the ‘case of missing heritability’ and, therefore, a compelling next analysis step. However, genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA) of all pairs of SNPs from a standard marker panel is computationally unfeasible without massive parallelization. Furthermore, GWIA of all SNP triples is utopian. In order to overcome these computational constraints, we present a GWIA approach that selects combinations of SNPs for interaction analysis based on a priori information. Sources of information are statistical evidence (single marker association at a moderate level), genetic relevance (genomic location) and biologic relevance (SNP function class and pathway information). We introduce the software package INTERSNP that implements a logistic regression framework as well as log-linear models for joint analysis of multiple SNPs. Automatic handling of SNP annotation and pathways from the KEGG database is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations to judge genome-wide significance are implemented. We introduce various meaningful GWIA strategies that can be conducted using INTERSNP. Typical examples are, for instance, the analysis of all pairs of non-synonymous SNPs, or, the analysis of all combinations of three SNPs that lie in a common pathway and that are among the top 50 000 single-marker results. We demonstrate the feasibility of these and other GWIA strategies by application to a GWAS dataset and discuss promising results.Availability:The software is available athttp://intersnp.meb.uni-bonn.deContact:herold@imbie.meb.uni-bonn.de;becker@imbie.meb.uni-bonn.de	8.0	4	478	2259	898	137	1036	0.309427396782	0.280558497024	0.265657865199	0.235411336519	-1.44343258333	1.63008719064	-2.45312332437	NULL	1.05720965835	1.63408071412

Assessment of sequencing performance and library quality is critical to the interpretation of RNA-seq data, yet few tools exist to address this issue. We introduce RNA-SeQC, a program which provides key measures of data quality. These metrics include yield, alignment and duplication rates; GC bias, rRNA content, regions of alignment (exon, intron and intragenic), continuity of coverage, 3′/5′ bias and count of detectable transcripts, among others. The software provides multi-sample evaluation of library construction protocols, input materials and other experimental parameters. The modularity of the software enables pipeline integration and the routine monitoring of key measures of data quality such as the number of alignable reads, duplication rates and rRNA contamination. RNA-SeQC allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream analysis. In summary, RNA-SeQC provides quality control measures critical to experiment design, process optimization and downstream computational analysis.Availability and implementation:Seewww.genepattern.orgto run online, orwww.broadinstitute.org/rna-seqc/for a command line tool.Contact:ddeluca@broadinstitute.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	22.0	5	485	730	535	860	2233	0.255306521255	0.232090138564	0.227120615442	0.220545253228	-2.40188893076	-1.2120636339	-1.93354608095	NULL	-1.56561522034	-2.40791707202

The classical structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our understanding of molecular biology breaks down when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary structure in their functional form. One convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely rare, and poorly adapted to the prediction of experimental data.Results:We presentflexible-meccano—a highly efficient algorithm that generates ensembles of molecules, on the basis of amino acid-specific conformational potentials and volume exclusion. Conformational sampling depends uniquely on the primary sequence, with the possibility of introducing additional local or long-range conformational propensities at an amino acid-specific resolution. The algorithm can also be used to calculate expected values of experimental parameters measured at atomic or molecular resolution, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle scattering, respectively. We envisage thatflexible-meccanowill be useful for researchers who wish to compare experimental data with those expected from a fully disordered protein, researchers who see experimental evidence of deviation from ‘random coil’ behaviour in their protein, or researchers who are interested in working with a broad ensemble of conformers representing the flexibility of the IDP of interest.Availability:A fully documented multi-platform executable is provided, with examples, athttp://www.ibs.fr/science-213/scientific-output/software/flexible-meccano/Contact:martin.blackledge@ibs.fr	14.0	4	487	1960	1785	2051	726	0.201363486023	0.197530228779	0.159666776104	0.144214009278	-0.581684543892	1.84886668055	3.49785747143	NULL	2.89882065151	-0.567069887991
546	http://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba_ud	547	NULL	IDBA-UD	Motivation:Next-generation sequencing allows us to sequence reads from a microbial environment using single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies. However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.Results:We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneousk-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.Availability:The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our websitehttp://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba_udContact:chin@cs.hku.hk	68.0	7	488	627	1257	1871	2198	0.542840912962	0.25538658338	0.233488970253	0.223971649915	0.808311421426	-1.12352034406	-2.85769721335	NULL	-0.689241875352	-2.50535104584
547	http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/	548	NULL	MoRFpred	Motivation:Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short binding regions located within longer intrinsically disordered regions that bind to protein partners via disorder-to-order transitions. MoRFs are implicated in important processes including signaling and regulation. However, only a limited number of experimentally validated MoRFs is known, which motivates development of computational methods that predict MoRFs from protein chains.Results:We introduce a new MoRF predictor, MoRFpred, which identifies all MoRF types (α, β, coil and complex). We develop a comprehensive dataset of annotated MoRFs to build and empirically compare our method. MoRFpred utilizes a novel design in which annotations generated by sequence alignment are fused with predictions generated by a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which uses a custom designed set of sequence-derived features. The features provide information about evolutionary profiles, selected physiochemical properties of amino acids, and predicted disorder, solvent accessibility and B-factors. Empirical evaluation on several datasets shows that MoRFpred outperforms related methods: α-MoRF-Pred that predicts α-MoRFs and ANCHOR which finds disordered regions that become ordered when bound to a globular partner. We show that our predicted (new) MoRF regions have non-random sequence similarity with native MoRFs. We use this observation along with the fact that predictions with higher probability are more accurate to identify putative MoRF regions. We also identify a few sequence-derived hallmarks of MoRFs. They are characterized by dips in the disorder predictions and higher hydrophobicity and stability when compared to adjacent (in the chain) residues.Availability:http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/;http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/Supplement.pdfContact:lkurgan@ece.ualberta.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	14.0	4	489	1309	1726	909	521	0.446411172395	0.196839951166	0.156282279181	0.142035890182	-2.46266557435	2.38197687974	2.67418315266	NULL	2.98931900517	-1.11765888472
548	http://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/genomering/	549	NULL	GenomeRing	Motivation:The number of completely sequenced genomes is continuously rising, allowing for comparative analyses of genomic variation. Such analyses are often based on whole-genome alignments to elucidate structural differences arising from insertions, deletions or from rearrangement events. Computational tools that can visualize genome alignments in a meaningful manner are needed to help researchers gain new insights into the underlying data. Such visualizations typically are either realized in a linear fashion as in genome browsers or by using a circular approach, where relationships between genomic regions are indicated by arcs. Both methods allow for the integration of additional information such as experimental data or annotations. However, providing a visualization that still allows for a quick and comprehensive interpretation of all important genomic variations together with various supplemental data, which may be highly heterogeneous, remains a challenge.Results:Here, we present two complementary approaches to tackle this problem. First, we propose the SuperGenome concept for the computation of a common coordinate system for all genomes in a multiple alignment. This coordinate system allows for the consistent placement of genome annotations in the presence of insertions, deletions and rearrangements. Second, we present the GenomeRing visualization that, based on the SuperGenome, creates an interactive overview visualization of the multiple genome alignment in a circular layout. We demonstrate our methods by applying them to an alignment ofCampylobacter jejunistrains for the discovery of genomic islands as well as to an alignment ofHelicobacter pylori, which we visualize in combination with gene expression data.Availability:GenomeRing and example data is available athttp://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/genomering/Contact:kay.nieselt@uni-tuebingen.de	2.0	5	490	999	238	170	896	0.225318307426	0.186430033854	0.185971966844	0.185865577741	2.10580282924	-1.15098455021	-0.234490402017	NULL	0.635631794814	-1.63611176873

DACTAL combines iteration with a novel divide-and-conquer approach, so that each iteration begins with a tree produced in the prior iteration, decomposes the taxon set into overlapping subsets, estimates trees on each subset, and then combines the smaller trees into a tree on the full taxon set using a new supertree method. We prove that DACTAL is guaranteed to produce the true tree under certain conditions. We compare DACTAL to SATé and maximum likelihood trees on estimated alignments using simulated and real datasets with 1000–27 643 taxa.Results:Our studies show that on average DACTAL yields more accurate trees than the two-phase methods we studied on very large datasets that are difficult to align, and has approximately the same accuracy on the easier datasets. The comparison to SATé shows that both have the same accuracy, but that DACTAL achieves this accuracy in a fraction of the time. Furthermore, DACTAL can analyze larger datasets than SATé, including a dataset with almost 28 000 sequences.Availability:DACTAL source code and results of dataset analyses are available atwww.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/dactal.Contact:tandy@cs.utexas.edu	2.0	4	491	2161	2264	1308	764	0.225914932274	0.196926387201	0.162941378088	0.161854122107	2.68010346672	1.68232182496	-0.102819341461	NULL	0.899349404105	-0.328096379181

Fundamental to the algorithm behind SEQuel is thepositional de Bruijn graph, a graph structure that modelsk-mers within reads while incorporating the approximate positions of reads into the model.Results:SEQuel reduced the number of small insertions and deletions in the assemblies of standard multi-cellEscherichia colidata by almost half, and corrected between 30% and 94% of the substitution errors.

With the advent of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), the problem of identifying structural alterations in the transcriptome is now attracting significant attention.In this article, we introduce two novel algorithmic formulations for identifying transcriptomic structural variants through aligning transcripts to the reference genome under the consideration of such variation. The first formulation is based on a nucleotide-level alignment model; a second, potentially faster formulation is based on chaining fragments shared between each transcript and the reference genome. Based on these formulations, we introduce a novel transcriptome-to-genome alignment tool,Dissect(DIScovery of Structural Alteration Event Containing Transcripts), which can identify and characterize transcriptomic events such as duplications, inversions, rearrangements and fusions. Dissect is suitable for whole transcriptome structural variation discovery problems involving sufficiently long reads or accurately assembled contigs.Results:We tested Dissect on simulated transcripts altered via structural events, as well as assembled RNA-Seq contigs from human prostate cancer cell line C4-2.

Decoys are selected if they are similar to active ligands according to five physical descriptors (molecular weight, number of rotational bonds, total hydrogen bond donors, total hydrogen bond acceptors and the octanol–water partition coefficient) without being chemically similar to any of the active ligands used as an input (according to the Tanimoto coefficient between MACCS fingerprints).

The identification and clear visualization of spatial clusters of contiguous genes targeted by specific DNA-binding proteins or sensitive to nucleoid perturbations can elucidate links between nucleoid structure and gene expression patterns. Similarly, statistical analysis to assess correlations between results from independent experiments can provide the integrated analysis needed in this line of research. NuST (Nucleoid Survey tools), based on theEscherichia coligenome, gives the non-expert the possibility to analyze the aggregation of genes or loci sets along the genome coordinate, at different scales of observation. It is useful to discover correlations between different sources of data (e.g. expression, binding or genomic data) and genome organization. A user can use it on datasets in the form of gene lists coming from his/her own experiments or bioinformatic analyses, but also make use of the internal database, which collects data from many published studies.Availability and Implementation:NuST is a web server (available athttp://www.lgm.upmc.fr/nust/).

558	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cbk/mmfph/	559	NULL	MMFPh	Motivation:Protein phosphorylation, driven by specific recognition of substrates by kinases and phosphatases, plays central roles in a variety of important cellular processes such as signaling and enzyme activation. Mass spectrometry enables the determination of phosphorylated peptides (and thereby proteins) in scenarios ranging from targetedin vitrostudies toin vivocell lysates under particular conditions. The characterization of commonalities among identified phosphopeptides provides insights into the specificities of the kinases involved in a study. Several algorithms have been developed to uncover linear motifs representing position-specific amino acid patterns in sets of phosphopeptides. To more fully capture the available information, reduce sensitivity to both parameter choices and natural experimental variation, and develop more precise characterizations of kinase specificities, it is necessary to determine all statistically significant motifs represented in a dataset.Results:We have developed MMFPh (MaximalMotifFinder forPhosphoproteomics datasets), which extends the approach of the popular phosphorylation motif software Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005) to identify all statistically significant motifs and return the maximal ones (those not subsumed by motifs with more fixed amino acids). In tests with both synthetic and experimental data, we show that MMFPh finds important motifs missed by the greedy approach of Motif-X, while also finding more motifs that are more characteristic of the dataset relative to the background proteome. Thus MMFPh is in some sense both more sensitive and more specific in characterizing the involved kinases. We also show that MMFPh compares favorably to other recent methods for finding phosphorylation motifs. Furthermore, MMFPh is less dependent on parameter choices.

Bioinformatics tools are required to facilitate these complicated analyses.

However, it is still expensive to sequence a large number of samples and therefore often small datasets are used. Given cost constraints, a potentially more powerful two-step strategy is to sequence a subset of the sample to discover variants, and genotype the identified variants in the remaining sample. If only cases are sequenced, directly combining sequence and genotype data will lead to inflated type-I errors in rare-variant association analysis. Although several methods have been developed to correct for the bias, they are either underpowered or theoretically invalid. We proposed a new method SEQCHIP to integrate genotype and sequence data, which can be used with most existing rare-variant tests.Results:It is demonstrated using both simulated and real datasets that the SEQCHIP method has controlled type-I errors, and is substantially more powerful than all other currently available methods.Availability:SEQCHIP is implemented in an R-Package and is available athttp://linkage.rockefeller.edu/suzanne/seqchip/Seqchip.htmContacts:dajiang@umich.eduorsleal@bcm.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	506	2406	575	1696	1112	0.361230437964	0.313013265562	0.274321562855	0.267734710864	0.54175671038	1.24338612676	-2.80873551146	NULL	-0.0599411485652	0.57149098565

However, their accuracy and read lengths are still lagging behind those of conventional Sanger sequencing method. Performance of next-generation sequencing platforms is fundamentally limited by various imperfections in the sequencing-by-synthesis and signal acquisition processes. This drives the search for accurate, scalable and computationally tractable base calling algorithms capable of accounting for such imperfections.Results:Relying on a statistical model of the sequencing-by-synthesis process and signal acquisition procedure, we develop a computationally efficient base calling method for Illumina's sequencing technology (specifically, Genome Analyzer II platform). Parameters of the model are estimated via a fast unsupervised online learning scheme, which uses the generalized expectation–maximization algorithm and requires only 3 s of running time per tile (on an Intel i7 machine @3.07GHz, single core)—a three orders of magnitude speed-up over existing parametric model-based methods. To minimize the latency between the end of the sequencing run and the generation of the base calling reports, we develop a fast online scalable decoding algorithm, which requires only 9 s/tile and achieves significantly lower error rates than the Illumina's base calling software. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed online parameter estimation scheme efficiently computes tile-dependent parameters, which can thereafter be provided to the base calling algorithm, resulting in significant improvements over previously developed base calling methods for the considered platform in terms of performance, time/complexity and latency.Availability:A C code implementation of our algorithm can be downloaded fromhttp://www.cerc.utexas.edu/OnlineCall/Contact:hvikalo@ece.utexas.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	507	1229	1112	2457	516	0.167161382045	0.156454852026	0.147365554476	0.143188056212	2.16075669394	-0.454276992259	-2.47423794053	NULL	-1.06898786055	-2.07842126498

Herein, we introduce Gowinda, a software specifically designed to test for enrichment of gene sets in GWA studies. We show that GO tests on GWA data could result in a substantial number of false-positive GO terms. Permutation tests implemented in Gowinda eliminate these biases, but maintain sufficient power to detect enrichment of GO terms. Since sufficient resolution for large datasets requires millions of permutations, we use multi-threading to keep computation times reasonable.Availability and implementation:Gowinda is implemented in Java (v1.6) and freely available onhttp://code.google.com/p/gowinda/Contact:christian.schloetterer@vetmeduni.ac.atSupplementary information:Manual:http://code.google.com/p/gowinda/wiki/Manual.

The most common source for protein disorder annotations, DisProt, covers only a fraction of the available sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures. Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding the content provided by already existing sources. In addition to the DisProt and PDB X-ray structures, we have added experimental information from NMR structures and five different flavours of two disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit manual annotations through a submission form. MobiDB features experimental annotations for 17 285 proteins, covering the entire PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database, with 565 200 annotated sequences. Depending on the disorder flavour, 6–20% of the residues are predicted as disordered.Availability:The database is freely available athttp://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/.Contact:silvio.tosatto@unipd.it	9.0	4	521	1534	1121	909	1566	0.42994252352	0.369175148346	0.233107737026	0.229828462363	-1.73269308873	1.75069172306	3.34203575453	NULL	2.98049589321	-0.837258674955

Input features consist of THEMATICS electrostatics data and pocket information from ConCavity. THEMATICS measures deviation from typical, sigmoidal titration behavior to identify functionally important residues and ConCavity identifies binding pockets by analyzing the surface geometry of protein structures. Both THEMATICS and ConCavity (structure only) do not require the query protein to have any sequence or structure similarity to other proteins. Hence, POOL is applicable to proteins with novel folds and engineered proteins.

Described here is a web interface to SALIGN, the versatile protein multiple sequence/structure alignment module of MODELLER. The web server automatically determines the best alignment procedure based on the inputs, while allowing the user to override default parameter values. Multiple alignments are guided by a dendrogram computed from a matrix of all pairwise alignment scores. When aligning sequences to structures, SALIGN uses structural environment information to place gaps optimally. If two multiple sequence alignments of related proteins are input to the server, a profile–profile alignment is performed. All features of the server have been previously optimized for accuracy, especially in the contexts of comparative modeling and identification of interacting protein partners.Availability:The SALIGN web server is freely accessible to the academic community athttp://salilab.org/salign.

Advances in next generation sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers of sRNA reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly, robust tools, capable of not only processing large sRNA datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing sRNA genomic features.

The former is computationally slow and has difficulty to identify clusters of irregular shapes. The latter approach cannot be applied directly to high-dimensional data as the computational time and memory become unmanageable and the estimated histogram is unreliable. An algorithm without these two problems would be very useful.Results:In this article, we combine ideas from the finite mixture model and histogram spatial exploration. This new algorithm, which we call flowPeaks, can be applied directly to high-dimensional data and identify irregular shape clusters. The algorithm first usesK-means algorithm with a largeKto partition the cell population into many small clusters. These partitioned data allow the generation of a smoothed density function using the finite mixture model. All local peaks are exhaustively searched by exploring the density function and the cells are clustered by the associated local peak. The algorithm flowPeaks is automatic, fast and reliable and robust to cluster shape and outliers.

However, a robust method to effectively identify the regions of differential nucleosome positioning (RDNPs) has not been previously available.Results:We describe a novel computational approach, DiNuP, that compares nucleosome profiles generated by high-throughput sequencing under various conditions. DiNuP provides a statisticalP-value for each identified RDNP based on the difference of read distributions. DiNuP also empirically estimates the false discovery rate as a cutoff when two samples have different sequencing depths and differentiate reliable RDNPs from the background noise. Evaluation of DiNuP showed it to be both sensitive and specific for the detection of changes in nucleosome location, occupancy and fuzziness. RDNPs that were identified using publicly available datasets revealed that nucleosome positioning dynamics are closely related to the epigenetic regulation of transcription.Availability and implementation:DiNuP is implemented in Python and is freely available athttp://www.tongji.edu.cn/~zhanglab/DiNuP.Contact:yzhang@tongji.edu.cnSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	530	2105	940	701	2389	0.25528243405	0.156802609577	0.14428533113	0.124255981988	0.591876842008	3.69634661614	0.546655569389	NULL	2.6622754404	-0.772141739118

Fast screening tools are needed to make epistasis analysis routinely available in GWAS.Results:We present BiForce to support high-throughput analysis of epistasis in GWAS for either quantitative or binary disease (case–control) traits. BiForce achieves great computational efficiency by using memory efficient data structures, Boolean bitwise operations and multithreaded parallelization. It performs a full pair-wise genome scan to detect interactions involving SNPs with or without significant marginal effects using appropriate Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds. We show that BiForce is more powerful and significantly faster than published tools for both binary and quantitative traits in a series of performance tests on simulated and real datasets. We demonstrate BiForce in analysing eight metabolic traits in a GWAS cohort (323 697 SNPs, >4500 individuals) and two disease traits in another (>340 000 SNPs, >1750 cases and 1500 controls) on a 32-node computing cluster. BiForce completed analyses of the eight metabolic traits within 1 day, identified nine epistatic pairs of SNPs in five metabolic traits and 18 SNP pairs in two disease traits. BiForce can make the analysis of epistasis a routine exercise in GWAS and thus improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic regulation of complex traits.Availability and implementation:The software is free and can be downloaded fromhttp://bioinfo.utu.fi/BiForce/.Contact:wenhua.wei@igmm.ed.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	531	981	2113	1437	938	0.2727392897	0.253080377775	0.226489736061	0.202871912765	-0.916119523814	1.66080975232	-2.56993909159	NULL	0.902109909857	1.64404286566

Rather, it is a search utility that readily accepts public or user-prepared reference files in various formats including GVF, Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3), Gene Transfer Format (GTF), VCF and Browser Extensible Data (BED) format. Compared to existing tools such as ANNOVAR, gSearch runs more than 10 times faster. For example, it is capable of annotating 52.8 million variants with allele frequencies in 6 min.Availability:gSearch is available athttp://ml.ssu.ac.kr/gSearch. It can be used as an independent search tool or can easily be integrated to existing pipelines through various programming environments such as Perl, Ruby and Python.Contacts:	1.0	4	537	699	1540	1572	2447	0.317923557324	0.23519473149	0.234233859949	0.213487358471	0.923008588987	1.11339867821	-3.24477761046	NULL	-1.08690655913	0.224840952299

Besides, collection of comprehensive datasets for protein–ligand complexes and their corresponding binding affinities is crucial in developing accurate scoring functions for the prediction of the binding affinities of previously unknown protein–ligand complexes. In the past decades, several databases of protein–ligand-binding affinities have been created via visual extraction from literature. However, such approaches are time-consuming and most of these databases are updated only a few times per year. Hence, there is an immediate demand for an automatic extraction method with high precision for binding affinity collection.Result:We have created a new database of protein–ligand-binding affinity data, AutoBind, based on automatic information retrieval. We first compiled a collection of 1586 articles where the binding affinities have been marked manually. Based on this annotated collection, we designed four sentence patterns that are used to scan full-text articles as well as a scoring function to rank the sentences that match our patterns. The proposed sentence patterns can effectively identify the binding affinities in full-text articles. Our assessment shows that AutoBind achieved 84.22% precision and 79.07% recall on the testing corpus. Currently, 13 616 protein–ligand complexes and the corresponding binding affinities have been deposited in AutoBind from 17 221 articles.Availability:AutoBind is automatically updated on a monthly basis, and it is freely available athttp://autobind.csie.ncku.edu.tw/andhttp://autobind.mc.ntu.edu.tw/.

Application of our system to 10.9 million MEDLINE abstracts and 234 000 open-access full-text articles from PubMed Central yielded over 36 million mentions representing 11.4 million distinct events.

Translation of these enormous network data into meaningful biological insights requires efficient computational techniques that can unearth the biological information that is encoded in the networks. One such example is network querying, which aims to identify similar subnetwork regions in a large target network that are similar to a given query network. Network querying tools can be used to identify novel biological pathways that are homologous to known pathways, thereby enabling knowledge transfer across different organisms.Results:In this article, we introduce an efficient algorithm for querying large-scale biological networks, called RESQUE. The proposed algorithm adopts a semi-Markov random walk (SMRW) model to probabilistically estimate the correspondence scores between nodes that belong to different networks. The target network is iteratively reduced based on the estimated correspondence scores, which are also iteratively re-estimated to improve accuracy until the best matching subnetwork emerges. We demonstrate that the proposed network querying scheme is computationally efficient, can handle any network query with an arbitrary topology and yields accurate querying results.Availability:The source code of RESQUE is freely available athttp://www.ece.tamu.edu/~bjyoon/RESQUE/Contact:bjyoon@ece.tamu.eduSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	540	682	1777	1561	966	0.462485862914	0.376543712671	0.279586004474	0.276491010971	1.54343045804	0.468241359547	2.49527472434	NULL	0.611377255278	2.87408084912

Although current aligners can efficiently map reads allowing a small number of mismatches, they are not well suited for handling a large number of mismatches. The efficiency of aligners can be improved using various heuristics, but the sensitivity and accuracy of the alignments are sacrificed. In this article, we introduce Basic Alignment tool for Mismatches (BatMis)—an efficient method to align short reads to a reference allowingkmismatches. BatMis is a Burrows–Wheeler transformation based aligner that uses a seed and extend approach, and it is an exact method.Results:Benchmark tests show that BatMis performs better than competing aligners in solving thek-mismatch problem. Furthermore, it can compete favorably even when compared with the heuristic modes of the other aligners. BatMis is a useful alternative for applications where fastk-mismatch mappings, unique mappings or multiple mappings of SGS data are required.Availability and implementation:BatMis is written in C/C++ and is freely available fromhttp://code.google.com/p/batmis/Contact:ksung@comp.nus.edu.sgSupplementary Information:Supplementary information is available fromBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	541	906	1027	130	1440	0.197818813921	0.168182167033	0.159037177264	0.156720686721	2.08550505031	-2.16955585509	-2.67430958785	NULL	-0.736876131066	-3.09047803144

Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model.Results:We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions.

605	http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GUniFrac	606	NULL	UniFrac	Motivation:The human microbiome plays an important role in human disease and health. Identification of factors that affect the microbiome composition can provide insights into disease mechanism as well as suggest ways to modulate the microbiome composition for therapeutical purposes. Distance-based statistical tests have been applied to test the association of microbiome composition with environmental or biological covariates. The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are the most widely used distance measures. However, these two measures assign too much weight either to rare lineages or to most abundant lineages, which can lead to loss of power when the important composition change occurs in moderately abundant lineages.Results:We develop generalized UniFrac distances that extend the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for detecting a much wider range of biologically relevant changes. We evaluate the use of generalized UniFrac distances in associating microbiome composition with environmental covariates using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that tests using the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are less powerful in detecting abundance change in moderately abundant lineages. In contrast, the generalized UniFrac distance is most powerful in detecting such changes, yet it retains nearly all its power for detecting rare and highly abundant lineages. The generalized UniFrac distance also has an overall better power than the joint use of unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances. Application to two real microbiome datasets has demonstrated gains in power in testing the associations between human microbiome and diet intakes and habitual smoking.Availability:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GUniFracContact:hongzhe@upenn.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	18.0	5	543	1903	2048	2063	2369	0.177509874526	0.14917592492	0.140079121861	0.136694036652	-0.423044952487	1.35430361271	1.02261921913	NULL	-0.172545084747	0.0482468695721

For this purpose, a frequently used approach is to apply an over-representation-based enrichment analysis. However, this approach has four drawbacks: (i) it can only score functional associations of overlapping gene/proteins sets; (ii) it disregards genes with missing annotations; (iii) it does not take into account the network structure of physical interactions between the gene/protein sets of interest and (iv) tissue-specific gene/protein set associations cannot be recognized.Results:To address these limitations, we introduce an integrative analysis approach and web-application called EnrichNet. It combines a novel graph-based statistic with an interactive sub-network visualization to accomplish two complementary goals: improving the prioritization of putative functional gene/protein set associations by exploiting information from molecular interaction networks and tissue-specific gene expression data and enabling a direct biological interpretation of the results. By using the approach to analyse sets of genes with known involvement in human diseases, new pathway associations are identified, reflecting a dense sub-network of interactions between their corresponding proteins.Availability:EnrichNet is freely available athttp://www.enrichnet.org.Contact:Natalio.Krasnogor@nottingham.ac.uk,reinhard.schneider@uni.luoravalencia@cnio.esSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsOnline.	12.0	6	555	2115	1444	1830	1657	0.313227466202	0.299300022056	0.270118111523	0.238426664691	-0.408433875066	0.225461332083	-1.36740076232	NULL	-0.387258155998	2.02694454294

Fortunately, the theory of evolution provides a simple solution: functional and structural information can be transferred between homologous proteins. Sequence similarity searching followed byk-nearest neighbor classification is the most widely used tool to predict the function or structure of anonymous gene products that come out of genome sequencing projects.Results:We present a novel word filter, suffix array neighborhood search (SANS), to identify protein sequence similarities in the range of 50–100% identity with sensitivity comparable to BLAST and 10 times the speed of USEARCH. In contrast to these previous approaches, the complexity of the search is proportional only to the length of the query sequence and independent of database size, enabling fast searching and functional annotation into the future despite rapidly expanding databases.Availability and implementation:The software is freely available to non-commercial users from our websitehttp://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/downloads/sans.Contact:liisa.holm@helsinki.fi.	1.0	4	556	1068	1866	792	1931	0.197341934188	0.1677476385	0.164774777819	0.164318410963	-1.37465595197	0.428597423138	1.4913672231	NULL	1.62279145614	1.26082807512
619	http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/	620	NULL	MetaCluster	Motivation:Metagenomic binning remains an important topic in metagenomic analysis. Existing unsupervised binning methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads do not perform well on (i) samples with low-abundance species or (ii) samples (even with high abundance) when there are many extremely low-abundance species. These two problems are common for real metagenomic datasets. Binning methods that can solve these problems are desirable.Results:We proposed a two-round binning method (MetaCluster 5.0) that aims at identifying both low-abundance and high-abundance species in the presence of a large amount of noise due to many extremely low-abundance species. In summary, MetaCluster 5.0 uses a filtering strategy to remove noise from the extremely low-abundance species. It separate reads of high-abundance species from those of low-abundance species in two different rounds. To overcome the issue of low coverage for low-abundance species, multiplewvalues are used to group reads with overlappingw-mers, whereas reads from high-abundance species are grouped with high confidence based on a largewand then binning expands to low-abundance species using a relaxed (shorter)w. Compared to the recent tools, TOSS and MetaCluster 4.0, MetaCluster 5.0 can find more species (especially those with low abundance of say 6× to 10×) and can achieve better sensitivity and specificity using less memory and running time.Availability:http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/Contact:chin@cs.hku.hk	7.0	4	557	1832	1820	627	1203	0.318373611129	0.213293495881	0.209735561402	0.197188770113	0.762328800545	-1.4287928388	-2.50725558682	NULL	-0.361081188332	-1.77878165959

With the current metagenomic samples accumulated, it is possible to build a database of metagenomic samples of interests. Any metagenomic samples could then be searched against this database to find the most similar metagenomic sample(s). However, on one hand, current databases with a large number of metagenomic samples mostly serve as data repositories that offer few functionalities for analysis; and on the other hand, methods to measure the similarity of metagenomic data work well only for small set of samples by pairwise comparison. It is not yet clear, how to efficiently search for metagenomic samples against a large metagenomic database.Results:In this study, we have proposed a novel method, Meta-Storms, that could systematically and efficiently organize and search metagenomic data. It includes the following components: (i) creating a database of metagenomic samples based on their taxonomical annotations, (ii) efficient indexing of samples in the database based on a hierarchical taxonomy indexing strategy, (iii) searching for a metagenomic sample against the database by a fast scoring function based on quantitative phylogeny and (iv) managing database by index export, index import, data insertion, data deletion and database merging. We have collected more than 1300 metagenomic data from the public domain and in-house facilities, and tested the Meta-Storms method on these datasets. Our experimental results show that Meta-Storms is capable of database creation and effective searching for a large number of metagenomic samples, and it could achieve similar accuracies compared with the current popular significance testing-based methods.Conclusion:Meta-Storms method would serve as a suitable database management and search system to quickly identify similar metagenomic samples from a large pool of samples.Contact:ningkang@qibebt.ac.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	571	2410	627	1348	1502	0.315346142465	0.296492694053	0.251574073424	0.20977801042	0.6702564017	-1.23911612213	-2.38337291395	NULL	-0.55193646006	-1.07462647356

On a monthly basis, new rare variant association methods are published. It is difficult to evaluate these methods because there is no standard to generate data and often comparisons are biased. In order to fairly compare rare variant association methods, it is necessary to generate data using realistic population demographic and phenotypic models.Result:SimRare is an interactive program that integrates generation of rare variant genotype/phenotype data and evaluation of association methods using a unified platform. Variant data are generated for gene regions using forward-time simulation that incorporates realistic population demographic and evolutionary scenarios. Phenotype data can be obtained for both case–control and quantitative traits. SimRare has a user-friendly interface that allows for easy entry of genetic and phenotypic parameters. Novel rare variant association methods implemented in R can also be imported into SimRare, to evaluate their performance and compare results, e.g. power and Type I error, with other currently available methods both numerically and graphically.Availability:http://code.google.com/p/simrare/Contact:sleal@bcm.edu	1.0	4	575	1627	1696	506	2406	0.34954109162	0.324751228595	0.313013265562	0.301559491455	0.399794163079	1.358198829	-2.77827250253	NULL	0.0381177625965	0.798215662615

Compadre is a tool to estimate pathway/gene sets activity indexes using sub-matrix decompositions for biological networks analyses. The Compadre pipeline also includes one of the direct uses of activity indexes to detect altered gene sets. For this, the gene expression sub-matrix of a gene set is decomposed into components, which are used to test differences between groups of samples. This procedure is performed with and without differentially expressed genes to decrease false calls. During this process, Compadre also performs an over-representation test. Compadre already implements four decomposition methods [principal component analysis (PCA), Isomaps, independent component analysis (ICA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)], six statistical tests (t- andf-test, SAM, Kruskal–Wallis, Welch and Brown–Forsythe), several gene sets (KEGG, BioCarta, Reactome, GO and MsigDB) and can be easily expanded. Our simulation results shown in Supplementary Information suggest that Compadre detects more pathways than over-representation tools like David, Babelomics and Webgestalt and less false positives than PLAGE. The output is composed of results from decomposition and over-representation analyses providing a more complete biological picture. Examples provided in Supplementary Information show the utility, versatility and simplicity of Compadre for analyses of biological networks.Availability and implementation:Compadre is freely available athttp://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx:8080/compadre.

Hence, it is crucial to have algorithms and implementations that perform fast, with high sensitivity, and are able to deal with long reads and a large absolute number of insertions and deletions.Results:RazerS is a read mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on countingq-grams. In this work, we propose the successor RazerS 3, which now supports shared-memory parallelism, an additional seed-based filter with adjustable sensitivity, a much faster, banded version of the Myers’ bit-vector algorithm for verification, memory-saving measures and support for the SAM output format. This leads to a much improved performance for mapping reads, in particular, long reads with many errors.

Protein similarity networks are graphical representations of sequence, structural and other similarities among proteins for which pairwise all-by-all similarity connections have been calculated. Mapping of biological and other information to network nodes or edges enables hypothesis creation about sequence–structure–function relationships across sets of related proteins. Pythoscape provides several options to calculate pairwise similarities for input sequences or structures, applies filters to network edges and defines sets of similar nodes and their associated data as single nodes (termed representative nodes) for compression of network information and output data or formatted files for visualization.Contact:babbitt@cgl.ucsf.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	592	1777	1689	682	2218	0.354434277515	0.294722550936	0.27759824483	0.27729150054	1.42034861933	0.400957141544	2.42252474158	NULL	0.959317708513	2.62250835133

High-throughput sequencing of microsatellite-enriched libraries dramatically expedites the traditional process of screening recombinant libraries for microsatellite markers. However, sorting through millions of reads to distill high-quality polymorphic markers requires special algorithms tailored to tolerate sequencing errors in locus reconstruction, distinguish paralogous loci, rarify raw reads originating from the same amplicon and sort out various artificial fragments resulting from recombination or concatenation of auxiliary adapters. Existing programs warrant improvement.Results: We describe a microsatellite prediction framework namedHighSSRfor microsatellite genotyping based on high-throughput sequencing. We demonstrate the utility ofHighSSRin comparison to RochegsAssembleron two Roche 454 GS FLX runs. The majority of theHighSSR-assembled loci were reliably mapped against model organism reference genomes.HighSSRdemultiplexes pooled libraries, assesses locus polymorphism and implementsPrimer3for the design of PCR primers flanking polymorphic microsatellite loci. As sequencing costs drop and permit the analysis of all project samples on next-generation platforms, this framework can also be used for direct simple sequence repeats genotyping.Availability:http://code.google.com/p/highssr/Contact:alexander@big.ac.cnSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	593	1275	2414	2451	1185	0.18023550598	0.167412076568	0.14995708651	0.146763188852	1.47787859914	-0.093460227634	-2.07243156395	NULL	-0.548433190093	-1.2810550668

It is therefore of interest to predict putative RNA–RNA duplexesin silicoon a genome-wide scale. Current computational methods for predicting these interactions range from fast complementary-based searches to those that take intramolecular binding into account. Together these methods constitute a trade-off between speed and accuracy, while leaving room for improvement within the context of genome-wide screens. A fast pre-filtering of putative duplexes would therefore be desirable.Results:We present RIsearch, an implementation of a simplified Turner energy model for fast computation of hybridization, which significantly reduces runtime while maintaining accuracy. Its time complexity for sequences of lengthsmandniswith a much smaller pre-factor than other tools. We show that this energy model is an accurate approximation of the full energy model for near-complementary RNA–RNA duplexes. RIsearch uses a Smith–Waterman-like algorithm using a dinucleotide scoring matrix which approximates the Turner nearest-neighbor energies. We show in benchmarks that we achieve a speed improvement of at least 2.4× compared with RNAplex, the currently fastest method for searching near-complementary regions. RIsearch shows a prediction accuracy similar to RNAplex on two datasets of known bacterial short RNA (sRNA)–messenger RNA (mRNA) and eukaryotic microRNA (miRNA)–mRNA interactions. Using RIsearch as a pre-filter in genome-wide screens reduces the number of binding site candidates reported by miRNA target prediction programs, such as TargetScanS and miRanda, by up to 70%. Likewise, substantial filtering was performed on bacterial RNA–RNA interaction data.Availability:The source code for RIsearch is available at:http://rth.dk/resources/risearch.Contact:gorodkin@rth.dkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	594	860	1423	568	730	0.335998591073	0.215616870976	0.206757849682	0.19839755468	-1.69121278855	-0.892716837472	2.27792742576	NULL	-0.75960735103	-2.44932153974

By clustering paired-end short reads into groups with their own unique tags, RAD-seq assembly problem is divided into subproblems. Fast and accurately clustering and assembling millions of RAD-seq reads with sequencing errors, different levels of heterozygosity and repetitive sequences is a challenging question.Results:Rainbow is developed to provide an ultra-fast and memory-efficient solution to clustering and assembling short reads produced by RAD-seq. First, Rainbow clusters reads using a spaced seed method. Then, Rainbow implements a heterozygote calling like strategy to divide potential groups into haplotypes in a top–down manner. And along a guided tree, it iteratively merges sibling leaves in a bottom–up manner if they are similar enough. Here, the similarity is defined by comparing the 2nd reads of a RAD segment. This approach tries to collapse heterozygote while discriminate repetitive sequences. At last, Rainbow uses a greedy algorithm to locally assemble merged reads into contigs. Rainbow not only outputs the optimal but also suboptimal assembly results. Based on simulation and a real guppy RAD-seq data, we show that Rainbow is more competent than the other tools in dealing with RAD-seq data.Availability:Source code in C, Rainbow is freely available athttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow/files/Contact:ruanjue@gmail.com	4.0	4	595	713	388	747	1833	0.296767058722	0.283661412943	0.179166120318	0.160728979748	1.12911841892	-2.76576895436	-2.38026959445	NULL	-1.56886564321	-2.13705176614

The presence of the entire microbe is then inferred from this isolated result. Problematically, the presence of recombination in microbial genomes would go undetected unless other genomic loci or protein components were specifically assayed. Microarrays lend themselves well to the detection of multiple loci from a given microbe; furthermore, the inherent nature of microarrays facilitates highly parallel interrogation of multiple microbes. However, none of the existing methods for analyzing diagnostic microarray data has the capacity to specifically identify recombinant microbes. In previous work, we developed a novel algorithm, VIPR, for analyzing diagnostic microarray data.Results:We have expanded upon our previous implementation of VIPR by incorporating a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect recombinant genomes. We trained our HMM on a set of non-recombinant parental viruses and applied our method to 11 recombinant alphaviruses and 4 recombinant flaviviruses hybridized to a diagnostic microarray in order to evaluate performance of the HMM. VIPR HMM correctly identified 95% of the 62 inter-species recombination breakpoints in the validation set and only two false-positive breakpoints were predicted. This study represents the first description and validation of an algorithm capable of detecting recombinant viruses based on diagnostic microarray hybridization patterns.Availability:VIPR HMM is freely available for academic use and can be downloaded fromhttp://ibridgenetwork.org/wustl/vipr.Contact:davewang@borcim.wustl.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	605	78	678	309	1592	0.259459031377	0.224145194909	0.180144739048	0.179135549463	2.09794257048	1.5370817987	-1.55240547744	NULL	1.18460651108	-0.349974583938

Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by hybridization to genomic tiling arrays (MeDIP-chip) is a cost-effective and sensitive method for methylome analyses. However, existing bioinformatics methods only enable a binary classification into unmethylated and methylated genomic regions, which limit biological interpretations. Indeed, DNA methylation levels can vary substantially within a given DNA fragment depending on the number and degree of methylated cytosines. Therefore, a method for the identification of more than two methylation states is highly desirable.Results:Here, we present a three-state hidden Markov model (MeDIP-HMM) for analyzing MeDIP-chip data. MeDIP-HMM uses a higher-order state-transition process improving modeling of spatial dependencies between chromosomal regions, allows a simultaneous analysis of replicates and enables a differentiation between unmethylated, methylated and highly methylated genomic regions. We train MeDIP-HMM using a Bayesian Baum–Welch algorithm, integrating prior knowledge on methylation levels. We apply MeDIP-HMM to the analysis of the Arabidopsis root methylome and systematically investigate the benefit of using higher-order HMMs. Moreover, we also perform an in-depth comparison study with existing methods and demonstrate the value of using MeDIP-HMM by comparisons to current knowledge on the Arabidopsis methylome. We find that MeDIP-HMM is a fast and precise method for the analysis of methylome data, enabling the identification of distinct DNA methylation levels.

With the rapid advance of MPS technologies, the sequencing cost per base is dramatically reducing, especially when using targeted MPS. Even though several approaches have been developed for deducing the fractional fetal DNA concentration, none of them can be used to deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentration directly from the sequencing data without prior genotype information.Result:In this study, we implement a statistical mixture model, namedFetalQuant, which utilizes the maximum likelihood to estimate the fractional fetal DNA concentration directly from targeted MPS of DNA in maternal plasma. This method allows the improved deduction of the fractional fetal DNA concentration, obviating the need of genotype information without loss of accuracy. Furthermore, by using Bayes’ rule, this method can distinguish the informative single-nucleotide polymorphism loci where the mother is homozygous and the fetus is heterozygous.

674	http://cs.stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/	675	NULL	FOLD-EM	Motivation:Owing to the size and complexity of large multi-component biological assemblies, the most tractable approach to determining their atomic structure is often to fit high-resolution radiographic or nuclear magnetic resonance structures of isolated components into lower resolution electron density maps of the larger assembly obtained using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This hybrid approach to structure determination requires that an atomic resolution structure of each component, or a suitable homolog, is available. If neither is available, then the amount of structural information regarding that component is limited by the resolution of the cryo-EM map. However, even if a suitable homolog cannot be identified using sequence analysis, a search for structural homologs should still be performed because structural homology often persists throughout evolution even when sequence homology is undetectable, As macromolecules can often be described as a collection of independently folded domains, one way of searching for structural homologs would be to systematically fit representative domain structures from a protein domain database into the medium/low resolution cryo-EM map and return the best fits. Taken together, the best fitting non-overlapping structures would constitute a ‘mosaic’ backbone model of the assembly that could aid map interpretation and illuminate biological function.Result:Using the computational principles of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), we have developed FOLD-EM—a computational tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in medium to low resolution (4–15 Å) electron density maps and return a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully automated fashion. As a by-product, FOLD-EM can also do flexible multi-domain fitting that may provide insight into conformational changes that occur in macromolecular assemblies.Availability and implementation:FOLD-EM is available at:http://cs.stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/, as a free open source software to the structural biology scientific community.Contact:mitul@cs.stanford.eduormcmorais@utmb.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	610	770	2057	561	1960	0.313733997336	0.302404803546	0.265457954548	0.191250544791	-0.570861293667	1.51267588767	2.63516928587	NULL	2.21118982731	-0.585908741709
675	http://protein.bio.unipd.it/raphael/	676	NULL	RAPHAEL	Motivation:Repeat proteins form a distinct class of structures where folding is greatly simplified. Several classes have been defined, with solenoid repeats of periodicity between ca. 5 and 40 being the most challenging to detect. Such proteins evolve quickly and their periodicity may be rapidly hidden at sequence level. From a structural point of view, finding solenoids may be complicated by the presence of insertions or multiple domains. To the best of our knowledge, no automated methods are available to characterize solenoid repeats from structure.Results:Here we introduce RAPHAEL, a novel method for the detection of solenoids in protein structures. It reliably solves three problems of increasing difficulty: (1) recognition of solenoid domains, (2) determination of their periodicity and (3) assignment of insertions. RAPHAEL uses a geometric approach mimicking manual classification, producing several numeric parameters that are optimized for maximum performance. The resulting method is very accurate, with 89.5% of solenoid proteins and 97.2% of non-solenoid proteins correctly classified. RAPHAEL periodicities have a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.877 against the manually established ones. A baseline algorithm for insertion detection in identified solenoids has aQ2value of 79.8%, suggesting room for further improvement. RAPHAEL finds 1931 highly confident repeat structures not previously annotated as solenoids in the Protein Data Bank records.Availability:The RAPHAEL web server is available with additional data athttp://protein.bio.unipd.it/raphael/Contact:silvio.tosatto@unipd.itSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline	2.0	4	611	1045	133	2359	1761	0.525832695513	0.144087493522	0.132100927609	0.130656354768	-2.39822070748	-3.3301617946	-0.830390041651	NULL	2.76234833213	0.0123213078181

The emergence of deep sequencing of trancriptome, known as RNA-seq, has opened many opportunities for the identification of this class of genomic alterations, leading to the discovery of novel chimeric transcripts in melanomas, breast cancers and lymphomas. Nowadays, few computational approaches have been developed for the detection of chimeric transcripts. Although all of these computational methods show good sensitivity, much work remains to reduce the huge number of false-positive calls that arises from this analysis.Results:We proposed a novel computational framework, named chimEric tranScript detection algorithm (EricScript), for the identification of gene fusion products in paired-end RNA-seq data.

These viruses typically do not strongly depend on the host DNA replication systems. In line with this observation, a number of essential DNA replication proteins, such as DNA polymerases, primases, helicases and ligases, have been identified in the NCLDVs. One other ubiquitous component of DNA replisomes is the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein. Intriguingly, no NCLDV homologs of canonical OB-fold-containing SSB proteins had previously been detected. Only in poxviruses, one of seven NCLDV families, I3 was identified as the SSB protein. However, whether I3 is related to any known protein structure has not yet been established.Results:Here, we addressed the case of ‘missing’ canonical SSB proteins in the NCLDVs and also probed evolutionary origins of the I3 family. Using advanced computational methods, in four NCLDV families, we detected homologs of the bacteriophage T7 SSB protein (gp2.5). We found the properties of these homologs to be consistent with the SSB function. Moreover, we implicated specific residues in single-stranded DNA binding. At the same time, we found no evolutionary link between the T7 gp2.5-like NCLDV SSB homologs and the poxviral SSB protein (I3). Instead, we identified a distant relationship between I3 and small protein B (SmpB), a bacterial RNA-binding protein. Thus, apparently, the NCLDVs have the two major distinct sets of SSB proteins having bacteriophage and bacterial origins, respectively.Contact:venclovas@ibt.ltSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	614	2340	975	406	947	0.139765562438	0.138173208394	0.136373697186	0.13079890977	-1.93998248005	1.53523019994	1.51904860379	NULL	2.68715060983	0.309901333683

685	http://scalce.sourceforge.net	686	NULL	SCALCE	Motivation:The high throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms generate unprecedented amounts of data that introduce challenges for the computational infrastructure. Data management, storage and analysis have become major logistical obstacles for those adopting the new platforms. The requirement for large investment for this purpose almost signalled the end of the Sequence Read Archive hosted at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which holds most of the sequence data generated world wide. Currently, most HTS data are compressed through general purpose algorithms such as gzip. These algorithms are not designed for compressing data generated by the HTS platforms; for example, they do not take advantage of the specific nature of genomic sequence data, that is, limited alphabet size and high similarity among reads. Fast and efficient compression algorithms designed specifically for HTS data should be able to address some of the issues in data management, storage and communication. Such algorithms would also help with analysis provided they offer additional capabilities such as random access to any read and indexing for efficient sequence similarity search. Here we present SCALCE, a ‘boosting’ scheme based on Locally Consistent Parsing technique, which reorganizes the reads in a way that results in a higher compression speed and compression rate, independent of the compression algorithm in use and without using a reference genome.Results:Our tests indicate that SCALCE can improve the compression rate achieved through gzip by a factor of 4.19—when the goal is to compress the reads alone. In fact, on SCALCE reordered reads, gzip running time can improve by a factor of 15.06 on a standard PC with a single core and 6 GB memory. Interestingly even the running time of SCALCE + gzip improves that of gzip alone by a factor of 2.09. When compared with the recently published BEETL, which aims to sort the (inverted) reads in lexicographic order for improving bzip2, SCALCE + gzip provides up to 2.01 times better compression while improving the running time by a factor of 5.17. SCALCE also provides the option to compress the quality scores as well as the read names, in addition to the reads themselves. This is achieved by compressing the quality scores through order-3 Arithmetic Coding (AC) and the read names through gzip through the reordering SCALCE provides on the reads. This way, in comparison with gzip compression of the unordered FASTQ files (including reads, read names and quality scores), SCALCE (together with gzip and arithmetic encoding) can provide up to 3.34 improvement in the compression rate and 1.26 improvement in running time.Availability:Our algorithm, SCALCE (Sequence Compression Algorithm using Locally Consistent Encoding), is implemented in C++ with both gzip and bzip2 compression options. It also supports multithreading when gzip option is selected, and the pigz binary is available.

Although there are many assemblers for assembling reads from a single genome, there are no assemblers for assembling reads in metagenomic data without reference genome sequences. Moreover, the performances of these assemblers on metagenomic data are far from satisfactory, because of the existence of common regions in the genomes of subspecies and species, which make the assembly problem much more complicated.Results:We introduce the Meta-IDBA algorithm for assembling reads in metagenomic data, which contain multiple genomes from different species. There are two core steps in Meta-IDBA. It first tries to partition the de Bruijn graph into isolated components of different species based on an important observation. Then, for each component, it captures the slight variants of the genomes of subspecies from the same species by multiple alignments and represents the genome of one species, using a consensus sequence. Comparison of the performances of Meta-IDBA and existing assemblers, such as Velvet and Abyss for different metagenomic datasets shows that Meta-IDBA can reconstruct longer contigs with similar accuracy.Availability:Meta-IDBA toolkit is available at our websitehttp://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/metaidba.Contact:chin@cs.hku.hk	16.0	4	627	488	571	2198	1832	0.542840912962	0.296492694053	0.253202094896	0.219244283711	0.878286093605	-1.23068877831	-2.73652138783	NULL	-0.564538568052	-2.51763618332

The user defines an amplicon sequence and chooses a set of thermodynamic and experimental parameters that include nearest neighbor stacking energies, loop entropy effects, cation (monovalent and Mg++) concentrations and a temperature range. Using an accelerated partition function algorithm along with chosen parameter values, uMelt interactively calculates and visualizes the mean helicity and the dissociation probability at each sequence position at temperatures within the temperature range. Predicted curves display the mean helicity as a function of temperature or as derivative plots. Predicted profiles display stability as a function of sequence position either as 50% helicity temperatures or as the helicity probability at specific temperatures. The loss of helicity associated with increasing temperature may be viewed dynamically to visualize domain formation within the molecule. Results from fluorescent high-resolution melting experiments match the number of predicted melting domains and their relative temperatures. However, the absolute melting temperatures vary with the selected thermodynamic parameters and current libraries do not account for the rapid melting rates and helix stabilizing dyes used in fluorescent melting experiments. uMelt provides a convenient platform for simulation and design of high-resolution melting assays.Availability and implementation:The application was developed in Actionscript and can be found online athttp://www.dna.utah.edu/umelt/umelt.html.

704	http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Implementations	705	NULL	OWL	Motivation:Ontologies are essential in biomedical research due to their ability to semantically integrate content from different scientific databases and resources. Their application improves capabilities for querying and mining biological knowledge. An increasing number of ontologies is being developed for this purpose, and considerable effort is invested into formally defining them in order to represent their semantics explicitly. However, current biomedical ontologies do not facilitate data integration and interoperability yet, since reasoning over these ontologies is very complex and cannot be performed efficiently or is even impossible. We propose the use of less expressive subsets of ontology representation languages to enable efficient reasoning and achieve the goal of genuine interoperability between ontologies.Results:We present and evaluate EL Vira, a framework that transforms OWL ontologies into the OWL EL subset, thereby enabling the use of tractable reasoning. We illustrate which OWL constructs and inferences are kept and lost following the conversion and demonstrate the performance gain of reasoning indicated by the significant reduction of processing time. We applied EL Vira to the open biomedical ontologies and provide a repository of ontologies resulting from this conversion. EL Vira creates a common layer of ontological interoperability that, for the first time, enables the creation of software solutions that can employ biomedical ontologies to perform inferences and answer complex queries to support scientific analyses.Availability and implementation:The EL Vira software is available fromhttp://el-vira.googlecode.comand converted OBO ontologies and their mappings are available fromhttp://bioonto.gen.cam.ac.uk/el-ont.Contact:rh497@cam.ac.uk	3.0	4	637	2301	2360	417	1103	0.286644889403	0.246469455102	0.237830209127	0.237781421906	-0.315907101031	-3.29989692979	1.46511802828	NULL	-2.15831805848	2.28021844948
705	http://oxfordhla.well.ox.ac.uk	706	[877]	HLA	Motivation:Genetic variation at classical HLA alleles influences many phenotypes, including susceptibility to autoimmune disease, resistance to pathogens and the risk of adverse drug reactions. However, classical HLA typing methods are often prohibitively expensive for large-scale studies. We previously described a method for imputing classical alleles from linked SNP genotype data. Here, we present a modification of the original algorithm implemented in a freely available software suite that combines local data preparation and QC with probabilistic imputation through a remote server.Results:We introduce two modifications to the original algorithm. First, we present a novel SNP selection function that leads to pronounced increases (up by 40% in some scenarios) in call rate. Second, we develop a parallelized model building algorithm that allows us to process a reference set of over 2500 individuals. In a validation experiment, we show that our framework produces highly accurate HLA type imputations at class I and class II loci for independent datasets: at call rates of 95–99%, imputation accuracy is between 92% and 98% at the four-digit level and over 97% at the two-digit level. We demonstrate utility of the method through analysis of a genome-wide association study for psoriasis where there is a known classical HLA risk allele (HLA-C*06:02). We show that the imputed allele shows stronger association with disease than any single SNP within the region. The imputation framework, HLA*IMP, provides a powerful tool for dissecting the architecture of genetic risk within the HLA.Availability:HLA*IMP, implemented in C++ and Perl, is available fromhttp://oxfordhla.well.ox.ac.ukand is free for academic use.Contact:mcvean@stats.ox.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	12.0	4	638	1818	2366	2073	2109	0.262493865692	0.249693788929	0.199510477343	0.178230003315	-0.0930814098863	1.10442214985	-2.16432916241	NULL	1.30131356818	1.57216312792

This results in a growing need for methods that can cope with the vast amount of structural data. To analyze the accumulating data, it is important to have a fast tool for identifying similar structures and clustering them by structural resemblance. Several excellent tools have been developed for the comparison of protein structures. These usually address the task of local structure alignment, an important yet computationally intensive problem due to its complexity. It is difficult to use such tools for comparing a large number of structures to each other at a reasonable time.Results:Here we present GOSSIP, a novel method for a global all-against-all alignment of any set of protein structures. The method detects similarities between structures down to a certain cutoff (a parameter of the program), hence allowing it to detect similar structures at a much higher speed than local structure alignment methods. GOSSIP compares many structures in times which are several orders of magnitude faster than well-known available structure alignment servers, and it is also faster than a database scanning method. We evaluate GOSSIP both on a dataset of short structural fragments and on two large sequence-diverse structural benchmarks. Our conclusions are that for a threshold of 0.6 and above, the speed of GOSSIP is obtainedwith no compromiseof the accuracy of the alignments or of the number of detected global similarities.Availability:A server, as well as an executable for download, are available athttp://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/gossip/.Contact:wolfson@tau.ac.il;ilonak@post.tau.ac.ilSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	639	1	515	836	331	0.290313205762	0.258758864805	0.247727556794	0.224013332353	-1.17321601281	0.48197186444	2.45081735545	NULL	2.02872912605	-0.994679562433

Nevertheless, many biologists, especially working with non-model organisms, still suffer from non-existing or low-coverage functional annotation, or simply struggle retrieving, summarizing and querying these data.Results:The Blast2GO Functional Annotation Repository (B2G-FAR) is a bioinformatics resource envisaged to provide functional information for otherwise uncharacterized sequence data and offers data mining tools to analyze a larger repertoire of species than currently available. This new annotation resource has been created by applying the Blast2GO functional annotation engine in a strongly high-throughput manner to the entire space of public available sequences. The resulting repository contains GO term predictions for over 13.2 million non-redundant protein sequences based on BLAST search alignments from the SIMAP database. We generated GO annotation for approximately 150 000 different taxa making available 2000 species with the highest coverage through B2G-FAR. A second section within B2G-FAR holds functional annotations for 17 non-model organism Affymetrix GeneChips.Conclusions:B2G-FAR provides easy access to exhaustive functional annotation for 2000 species offering a good balance between quality and quantity, thereby supporting functional genomics research especially in the case of non-model organisms.Availability:The annotation resource is available athttp://www.b2gfar.org.Contact:aconesa@cipf.es;sgoetz@cipf.esSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	8.0	4	640	271	1979	336	957	0.424975807977	0.284817884773	0.243700340476	0.239402930439	1.3688760409	-1.19635709311	3.22248184743	NULL	-1.02795308907	2.27011556261

A natural data representation for such cases are space partitioning data structures. However, the associated range queries assume noise-free observations and cannot take into account observation-specific uncertainty estimates that are present in e.g. modern mass spectrometry data. In order to accommodate the inhomogeneous noise characteristics of sparse real-world datasets, point queries need to be reformulated in terms of box intersection queries, where box sizes correspond to uncertainty regions for each observation.Results:This contribution introduceslibfbi, a standard C++, header-only template implementation for fast box intersection in an arbitrary number of dimensions, with arbitrary data types in each dimension.

Although many methods exist for extracting these sub-networks, very few existing approaches simultaneously consider both the differential expression of individual genes and the differential correlation of gene pairs, losing potentially valuable information in the data.Results:In this article, we propose a new method, COSINE (COndition SpecIfic sub-NEtwork), which employs a scoring function that jointly measures the condition-specific changes of both ‘nodes’ (individual genes) and ‘edges’ (gene–gene co-expression). It uses the genetic algorithm to search for the single optimal sub-network which maximizes the scoring function. We applied COSINE to both simulated datasets with various differential expression patterns, and three real datasets, one prostate cancer dataset, a second one from the across-tissue comparison of morbidly obese patients and the other from the across-population comparison of the HapMap samples.

Parallelized versions of the Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC3) algorithm in MrBayes have been presented that can run on various platforms, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU has been used as a cost-effective means for computational research in many fields. However, until now, some limitations have prevented the GPU from being used to run MrBayes MC3effectively.Results:We give an appraisal of the possibility of realistically implementing MrBayes MC3in parallel on an ordinary four-core desktop computer with a GPU. An earlier proposed algorithm for running MrBayes MC3in parallel on a GPU has some significant drawbacks (e.g. too much CPU–GPU communication) which we resolve. We implement these improvements on the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 as most other GPUs are unsuitable for running MrBayes MC3due to a range of reasons, such as having insufficient support for double precision floating-point arithmetic. Experiments indicate that run-time can be decreased by a factor of up to 5.4 by adding a single GPU (versus state-of-the-art multicore parallel algorithms). We can also achieve a speedup (versus serial MrBayes MC3) of more than 40 on a sufficiently large dataset using two GPUs.Availability:GPU MrBayes (i.e. the proposed implementation of MrBayes MC3for the GPU) is available fromhttp://mrbayes-gpu.sourceforge.net/.Contact:liuxg74@yahoo.com.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare avaliable atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	658	126	2355	821	1324	0.331270919016	0.227910459183	0.197888842816	0.194187927072	2.01450319493	2.58993617253	-0.157149627373	NULL	0.832222237957	0.137929500311

While some existing methods use comparative genomic approaches to identify plant precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), others are based on the complementarity characteristics between miRNAs and their target mRNAs sequences. However, they can only identify the homologous miRNAs or the limited complementary miRNAs. Furthermore, since the plant pre-miRNAs are quite different from the animal pre-miRNAs, all theab initiomethods for animals cannot be applied to plants. Therefore, it is essential to develop a method based on machine learning to classify real plant pre-miRNAs and pseudo genome hairpins.Results:A novel classification method based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed specifically for predicting plant pre-miRNAs. To make efficient prediction, we extract the pseudo hairpin sequences from the protein coding sequences ofArabidopsis thalianaandGlycine max, respectively. These pseudo pre-miRNAs are extracted in this study for the first time. A set of informative features are selected to improve the classification accuracy. The training samples are selected according to their distributions in the high-dimensional sample space.

The superior performance of the proposed classifier can be attributed to the extracted plant pseudo pre-miRNAs, the selected training dataset and the carefully selected features.

It considers a collection of finite mixture models combined with a false discovery rate (FDR) criterion to find statistically significant regions. This leads to a more reliable assessment of differential binding sites based on a statistical approach. In addition to ChIP-seq, DIME is also applicable to data from other high-throughput platforms.Availability and implementation:DIME is implemented as an R-package, which is available athttp://www.stat.osu.edu/~statgen/SOFTWARE/DIME.

While the theoretical contribution of epistasis toward phenotypes of medical and economic importance is widely discussed, empirical evidence is conspicuously absent because its analysis is often computationally prohibitive. To facilitate resolution in this field, tools must be made available that can render the search for epistasis universally viable in terms of hardware availability, cost and computational time.Results:By partitioning the 2D search grid across the multicore architecture of a modern consumer graphics processing unit (GPU), we report a 92× increase in the speed of an exhaustive pairwise epistasis scan for a quantitative phenotype, and we expect the speed to increase as graphics cards continue to improve. To achieve a comparable computational improvement without a graphics card would require a large compute-cluster, an option that is often financially non-viable. The implementation presented uses OpenCL—an open-source library designed to run on any commercially available GPU and on any operating system.Availability:The software is free, open-source, platform-independent and GPU-vendor independent.

PONDEROSA incorporates and integrates external software packages (TALOS+, STRIDE and CYANA) to carry out different steps in the structure determination. PONDEROSA implements internal functions that identify and validate NOESY peak assignments and assess the quality of the calculated three-dimensional structure of the protein. The robustness of the analysis results from PONDEROSA's hierarchical processing steps that involve iterative interaction among the internal and external modules. PONDEROSA supports a variety of input formats: SPARKY assignment table (.shifts) and spectrum file formats (.ucsf), XEASY proton file format (.prot), and NMR-STAR format (.star). To demonstrate the utility of PONDEROSA, we used the package to determine 3D structures of two proteins: human ubiquitin andEscherichia coliiron-sulfur scaffold protein variant IscU(D39A).

The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences. Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include Watson–Crick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of Watson–Crick and non-Watson–Crick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.Availability:http://www.microbio.me/boulderale.Contact:jesse.stombaugh@colorado.edu	1.0	4	673	836	168	999	2325	0.301851316819	0.257711639656	0.256660810694	0.238362025331	-0.981189197303	-0.328960029555	2.4071588496	NULL	0.840624101901	-2.0379985698

Pathway associations are especially consequential, but existing algorithms are demonstrably inadequate.Methods:Here, we propose the PathScan significance test for the scenario where pathway mutations collectively contribute to tumor development. Its design addresses two aspects that established methods neglect. First, we account for variations in gene length and the consequent differences in their mutation probabilities under the standard null hypothesis of random mutation. The associated spike in computational effort is mitigated by accurate convolution-based approximation. Second, we combine individual probabilities into a multiple-sample value using Fisher–Lancaster theory, thereby improving differentiation between a few highly mutated genes and many genes having only a few mutations apiece. We investigate accuracy, computational effort and power, reporting acceptable performance for each.Results:As an example calculation, we re-analyze KEGG-based lung adenocarcinoma pathway mutations from the Tumor Sequencing Project. Our test recapitulates the most significant pathways and finds that others for which the original test battery was inconclusive are not actually significant. It also identifies the focal adhesion pathway as being significantly mutated, a finding consistent with earlier studies. We also expand this analysis to other databases: Reactome, BioCarta, Pfam, PID and SMART, finding additional hits in ErbB and EPHA signaling pathways and regulation of telomerase. All have implications and plausible mechanistic roles in cancer.

Unfortunately, preparation of samples for a large number of individuals is still very cost- and labor intensive. Thus, recently, screens for rare sequence variants were carried out in samples of pooled DNA, in which equimolar amounts of DNA from multiple individuals are mixed prior to sequencing with HTS. The resulting sequence data, however, poses a bioinformatics challenge: the discrimination of sequencing errors from real sequence variants present at a low frequency in the DNA pool.Results:Our method vipR uses data from multiple DNA pools in order to compensate for differences in sequencing error rates along the sequenced region. More precisely, instead of aiming at discriminating sequence variants from sequencing errors, vipR identifies sequence positions that exhibit significantly different minor allele frequencies in at least two DNA pools using the Skellam distribution. The performance of vipR was compared with three other models on data from a targeted resequencing study of the TMEM132D locus in 600 individuals distributed over four DNA pools. Performance of the methods was computed on SNPs that were also genotyped individually using a MALDI-TOF technique. On a set of 82 sequence variants, vipR achieved an average sensitivity of 0.80 at an average specificity of 0.92, thus outperforming the reference methods by at least 0.17 in specificity at comparable sensitivity.Availability:The code of vipR is freely available via:http://sourceforge.net/projects/htsvipr/Contact:altmann@mpipsykl.mpg.de	3.0	4	678	109	605	1696	506	0.256570310512	0.224145194909	0.200809094594	0.193559449351	1.2875597384	0.843249207237	-2.45748718563	NULL	0.304116515874	-0.78490574305

However, the specific functional roles of most miRNAs and their combinatorial effects in cellular processes are still unclear. The availability of multiple types of functional genomic data provides unprecedented opportunities to study the miRNA–gene regulation. A major challenge is how to integrate the diverse genomic data to identify the regulatory modules of miRNAs and genes.Results:Here we propose an effective data integration framework to identify the miRNA–gene regulatory comodules. The miRNA and gene expression profiles are jointly analyzed in a multiple non-negative matrix factorization framework, and additional network data are simultaneously integrated in a regularized manner. Meanwhile, we employ the sparsity penalties to the variables to achieve modular solutions. The mathematical formulation can be effectively solved by an iterative multiplicative updating algorithm. We apply the proposed method to integrate a set of heterogeneous data sources including the expression profiles of miRNAs and genes on 385 human ovarian cancer samples, computationally predicted miRNA–gene interactions, and gene–gene interactions. We demonstrate that the miRNAs and genes in 69% of the regulatory comodules are significantly associated. Moreover, the comodules are significantly enriched in known functional sets such as miRNA clusters, GO biological processes and KEGG pathways, respectively. Furthermore, many miRNAs and genes in the comodules are related with various cancers including ovarian cancer. Finally, we show that comodules can stratify patients (samples) into groups with significant clinical characteristics.Availability:The program and supplementary materials are available athttp://zhoulab.usc.edu/SNMNMF/.Contact:xjzhou@usc.edu;zsh@amss.ac.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	9.0	4	679	2144	1547	783	2253	0.349449910852	0.309547840998	0.301185382735	0.263626347827	-2.96801709334	-1.20800181497	-0.338915581486	NULL	-2.09149139761	-1.43374771587

However, it is unclear how to correct for confounding factors such as population structure, age or gender or experimental conditions in Support Vector Machine classification.Results:In this article, we present a Support Vector Machine classifier that can correct the prediction for observed confounding factors. This is achieved by minimizing the statistical dependence between the classifier and the confounding factors. We prove that this formulation can be transformed into a standard Support Vector Machine with rescaled input data.

751	http://bioinformatics.cise.ufl.edu/palRINQ.html	752	NULL	RINQ	We consider the problem of similarity queries in biological network databases. Given a database of networks, similarity query returns all the database networks whose similarity (i.e. alignment score) to a given query network is at least a specified similarity cutoff value. Alignment of two networks is a very costly operation, which makes exhaustive comparison of all the database networks with a query impractical. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel indexing method, named RINQ (Reference-based Indexing for Biological Network Queries). Our method uses a set of reference networks to eliminate a large portion of the database quickly for each query. A reference network is a small biological network. We precompute and store the alignments of all the references with all the database networks. When our database is queried, we align the query network with all the reference networks. Using these alignments, we calculate a lower bound and an approximate upper bound to the alignment score of each database network with the query network. With the help of upper and lower bounds, we eliminate the majority of the database networks without aligning them to the query network. We also quickly identify a small portion of these as guaranteed to be similar to the query. We perform pairwise alignment only for the remaining networks. We also propose a supervised method to pick references that have a large chance of filtering the unpromising database networks. Extensive experimental evaluation suggests that (i) our method reduced the running time of a single query on a database of around 300 networks from over 2 days to only 8 h; (ii) our method outperformed the state of the art method Closure Tree and SAGA by a factor of three or more; and (iii) our method successfully identified statistically and biologically significant relationships across networks and organisms.Contact:ggulsoy@cise.ufl.edu;tamer@cise.ufl.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	682	540	1689	1777	1561	0.462485862914	0.3965705403	0.389326115748	0.346614998666	1.5545040345	0.466515506049	2.50697054537	NULL	0.60306816498	2.84929771017

Due to the complexity of the methods and software packages available, each with its particular format requiring intricate management workflows, the analysis of GWAS usually confronts scientists with steep learning curves. Indeed, the wide variety of tools makes the parsing and manipulation of data the most time consuming and error prone part of a study. To help resolve these issues, we present GWASpi, a user-friendly, multiplatform, desktop-able application for the management and analysis of GWAS data, with a novel approach on database technologies to leverage the most out of commonly available desktop hardware. GWASpi aims to be a start-to-finish GWAS management application, from raw data to results, containing the most common analysis tools. As a result, GWASpi is easy to use and reduces in up to two orders of magnitude the time needed to perform the fundamental steps of a GWAS.Availability:Freely available on the web athttp://www.gwaspi.org.

Despite the wide availability of CE-based instruments, there remain challenges in leveraging their full power for quantitative analysis of RNA and DNA structure, thermodynamics and kinetics. In particular, the slow rate and poor automation of available analysis tools have bottlenecked a new generation of studies involving hundreds of CE profiles per experiment.Results:We propose a computational method calledhigh-throughput robust analysis for capillary electrophoresis(HiTRACE) to automate the key tasks in large-scale nucleic acid CE analysis, including the profile alignment that has heretofore been a rate-limiting step in the highest throughput experiments. We illustrate the application of HiTRACE on 13 datasets representing 4 different RNAs, 3 chemical modification strategies and up to 480 single mutant variants; the largest datasets each include 87 360 bands. By applying a series of robust dynamic programming algorithms, HiTRACE outperforms prior tools in terms of alignment and fitting quality, as assessed by measures including the correlation between quantified band intensities between replicate datasets. Furthermore, while the smallest of these datasets required 7–10 h of manual intervention using prior approaches, HiTRACE quantitation of even the largest datasets herein was achieved in 3–12 min. The HiTRACE method, therefore, resolves a critical barrier to the efficient and accurate analysis of nucleic acid structure in experiments involving tens of thousands of electrophoretic bands.Availability:HiTRACE is freely available for download athttp://hitrace.stanford.edu.Contact:sryoon@korea.ac.kr;rhiju@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	684	1050	1486	2007	1055	0.179992053615	0.12528093587	0.115792184047	0.11576644761	-2.89765928386	0.9148076698	2.59275012557	NULL	0.0942904412601	-0.651826850194

To detect fusion genes, the current bioinformatics tools heavily rely on paired-end approaches and overlook the importance of reads that span fusion junctions. Thus there is a need to develop an efficient aligner to detect fusion events by accurate mapping of these junction-spanning single reads, particularly when the read gets longer with the improvement in sequencing technology.Results:We present a novel method, FusionMap, which aligns fusion reads directly to the genome without prior knowledge of potential fusion regions. FusionMap can detect fusion events in both single- and paired-end datasets from either RNA-Seq or gDNA-Seq studies and characterize fusion junctions at base-pair resolution. We showed that FusionMap achieved high sensitivity and specificity in fusion detection on two simulated RNA-Seq datasets, which contained 75 nt paired-end reads. FusionMap achieved substantially higher sensitivity and specificity than the paired-end approach when the inner distance between read pairs was small. Using FusionMap to characterize fusion genes in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, we further demonstrated its accuracy in fusion detection in both single-end RNA-Seq and gDNA-Seq datasets.

However, structurally they are more complicated, existing in a range of oligomer states and topologies. Here, we address the issue of predicting coiled-coil oligomeric state from protein sequence.Results:The predominant coiled-coil oligomer states in Nature are parallel dimers and trimers. Here, we improve and retrain the first-published algorithm, SCORER, that distinguishes these states, and test it against the current standard, MultiCoil. The SCORER algorithm has been revised in two key respects: first, the statistical basis for SCORER is improved markedly. Second, the training set for SCORER has been expanded and updated to include only structurally validated coiled coils.

Currently, our knowledge about the functions of transporters is limited due to the paucity of their 3D structures. Hence, computational techniques are necessary to annotate the functions of transporters. In this work, we focused on an important functional aspect of transporters, namely annotation of targets for transport proteins. We have systematically analyzed four major classes of transporters with different transporter targets: (i) electron, (ii) protein/mRNA, (iii) ion and (iv) others, using amino acid properties. We have developed a radial basis function network-based method for predicting transport targets with amino acid properties and position specific scoring matrix profiles. Our method showed a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 90.1, 80.1, 70.3 and 82.3% for electron transporters, protein/mRNA transporters, ion transporters and others, respectively, in a dataset of 543 transporters. We have also evaluated the performance of the method with an independent dataset of 108 proteins and we obtained similar accuracy. We suggest that our method could be an effective tool for functional annotation of transport proteins.Availability:http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/ttrbf.htmlContact:yien@csie.org;gromiha@iitm.ac.inSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	704	1975	1937	734	1101	0.130062700685	0.117083299762	0.113045755108	0.103856007665	-2.35954986551	1.52689182042	2.55665858079	NULL	2.276071063	-1.44786077726

Thus, the integrative analysis of multiple sources of genomic data and information deepens the resolution and enhances the interpretation of stand-alone high-throughput data. In this note, we presentPREDA(Position RElated Data Analysis), an R package for detecting regional variations in genomics data.PREDAidentifies relevant chromosomal patterns in high-throughput data using a smoothing approach that accounts for distance and density variability of genomics features. Custom-designed data structures allow efficiently managing diverse signals in different genomes. A variety of smoothing functions and statistics empower flexible and robust workflows. The modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines.

A reliable computational tool for identifying such structures would be very useful in guiding experimental analyses of their biological functions. NASP (Nucleic Acid Structure Predictor) is a program that takes into account thermodynamic stability, Boltzmann base pair probabilities, alignment uncertainty, covarying sites and evolutionary conservation to identify biologically relevant secondary structures within multiple sequence alignments. Unique to NASP is the consideration of all this information together with a recursive permutation-based approach to progressively identify and list the most conserved probable secondary structures that are likely to have the greatest biological relevance. By focusing on identifying only evolutionarily conserved structures, NASP forgoes the prediction of complete nucleotide folds but outperforms various other secondary structure prediction methods in its ability to selectively identify actual base pairings.Availability:Downloable and web-based versions of NASP are freely available athttp://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~yves/nasp_portal.phpContact:yves@cbio.uct.ac.zaSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	722	2325	1234	331	1050	0.225397009355	0.200203334432	0.179691323074	0.175042341903	-1.1899829702	-0.191589414737	2.83960847954	NULL	1.3101092356	-2.09166493255

The value of refining the calculated conformers using restrained MD (rMD) simulations with state-of-art force fields is documented. This refinement however presents various subtleties, from the proper formatting of conformational restraints to the definition of suitable protocols.Results:We describe a web interface to set up and run calculations with the AMBER package, which we called AMPS-NMR (AMBER-based Portal Server for NMR structures). The interface allows the refinement of NMR structures through rMD. Some predefined protocols are provided for this purpose, which can be personalized; it is also possible to create an entirely new protocol. AMPS-NMR can handle various restraint types.

These datasets present new challenges. The first is speed. Many motif discovery methods do not scale well to large datasets. Another issue is identifying discriminative rather than generative motifs. Such discriminative motifs are important for identifying co-factors and for explaining changes in behavior between different conditions.Results:To address these issues we developed a method for DECOnvolved Discriminative motif discovery (DECOD). DECOD uses ak-mer count table and so its running time is independent of the size of the input set. By deconvolving thek-mers DECOD considers context information without using the sequences directly. DECOD outperforms previous methods both in speed and in accuracy when using simulated and real biological benchmark data.

800	http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM	801	NULL	RUM	Motivation:A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously.Results:We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability.Availability:The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM).Contact:ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu;epierce@mail.med.upenn.eduSupplementary Information:The RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248.	20.0	5	730	1041	1122	2393	1232	0.464339500442	0.34311756961	0.321215074189	0.31419938188	-2.52911647359	-1.20835626022	-1.89772266954	NULL	-1.75128226938	-2.33241634554
801	http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/seed	802	NULL	SEED	Motivation:Similarity clustering of next-generation sequences (NGS) is an important computational problem to study the population sizes of DNA/RNA molecules and to reduce the redundancies in NGS data. Currently, most sequence clustering algorithms are limited by their speed and scalability, and thus cannot handle data with tens of millions of reads.Results:Here, we introduce SEED—an efficient algorithm for clustering very large NGS sets. It joins sequences into clusters that can differ by up to three mismatches and three overhanging residues from their virtual center. It is based on a modified spaced seed method, called block spaced seeds. Its clustering component operates on the hash tables by first identifying virtual center sequences and then finding all their neighboring sequences that meet the similarity parameters. SEED can cluster 100 million short read sequences in <4 h with a linear time and memory performance. When using SEED as a preprocessing tool on genome/transcriptome assembly data, it was able to reduce the time and memory requirements of the Velvet/Oasis assembler for the datasets used in this study by 60–85% and 21–41%, respectively. In addition, the assemblies contained longer contigs than non-preprocessed data as indicated by 12–27% larger N50 values. Compared with other clustering tools, SEED showed the best performance in generating clusters of NGS data similar to true cluster results with a 2- to 10-fold better time performance. While most of SEED's utilities fall into the preprocessing area of NGS data, our tests also demonstrate its efficiency as stand-alone tool for discovering clusters of small RNA sequences in NGS data from unsequenced organisms.Availability:The SEED software can be downloaded for free from this site:http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/seed.Contact:thomas.girke@ucr.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline	3.0	4	731	2281	723	1850	2378	0.366218600861	0.271970243122	0.244551564272	0.243793581775	0.833466018096	-0.735136303081	-0.702222291093	NULL	-0.402308535824	-1.16346980316

Thus, there has been considerable interest in the prediction of secondary structures for RNA families. In this article, we present a new global structural alignment algorithm, RNAG, to predict consensus secondary structures for unaligned sequences. It uses a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm, which has a theoretical advantage in convergence time. This algorithm iteratively samples from the conditional probability distributions P(Structure | Alignment) and P(Alignment | Structure). Not surprisingly, there is considerable uncertainly in the high-dimensional space of this difficult problem, which has so far received limited attention in this field. We show how the samples drawn from this algorithm can be used to more fully characterize the posterior space and to assess the uncertainty of predictions.Results:Our analysis of three publically available datasets showed a substantial improvement in RNA structure prediction by RNAG over extant prediction methods. Additionally, our analysis of 17 RNA families showed that the RNAG sampled structures were generally compact around their ensemble centroids, and at least 11 families had at least two well-separated clusters of predicted structures. In general, the distance between a reference structure and our predicted structure was large relative to the variation among structures within an ensemble.Availability:The Perl implementation of the RNAG algorithm and the data necessary to reproduce the results described inSections 3.1and3.2are available athttp://ccmbweb.ccv.brown.edu/rnag.htmlContact:charles_lawrence@brown.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	732	2325	77	168	2007	0.326539873294	0.268579159362	0.260389053017	0.239742657066	-1.25642377511	-0.303198611946	2.63420430579	NULL	0.98637244052	-2.11337241417

However, it has been shown that matrices specific to certain protein groups (e.g. mitochondrial) or life domains (e.g. viruses) differ significantly from general average matrices, and thus perform better when applied to the data to which they are dedicated. This Web server implements the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure that was used to estimate LG, and provides a number of tools and facilities. Users upload a set of multiple protein alignments from their domain of interest and receive the resulting matrix by email, along with statistics and comparisons with other matrices.

The software maps phylogenies annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial information and can export high-dimensional posterior summaries to keyhole markup language (KML) for animation of the spatial diffusion through time in virtual globe software. In addition, SPREAD implements Bayes factor calculation to evaluate the support for hypotheses of historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations based on Bayesian stochastic search variable selection estimates.

Consideration of dihedral angles as variables reduces the computational cost and non-physical distortions of classical Cartesian NMA methods.

Peptides, which partially mimic the interface area of one of the interacting proteins, are natural candidates to form protein–peptide complexes competing with the original PPI. The prediction of such complexes is especially challenging due to the high flexibility of peptide conformations.Results:In this article, we present PepCrawler, a new tool for deriving binding peptides from protein–protein complexes and prediction of peptide–protein complexes, by performing high-resolution docking refinement and estimation of binding affinity. By using a fast path planning approach, PepCrawler rapidly generates large amounts of flexible peptide conformations, allowing backbone and side chain flexibility. A newly introduced binding energy funnel ‘steepness score’ was applied for the evaluation of the protein–peptide complexes binding affinity. PepCrawler simulations predicted high binding affinity for native protein–peptide complexes benchmark and low affinity for low-energy decoy complexes. In three cases, where wet lab data are available, the PepCrawler predictions were consistent with the data. Comparing to other state of the art flexible peptide–protein structure prediction algorithms, our algorithm is very fast, and takes only minutes to run on a single PC.Availability:http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PepCrawler/Contact:eladdons@tau.ac.il;wolfson@tau.ac.il	4.0	4	742	1819	150	538	418	0.546896842931	0.279311928136	0.252707080348	0.24919102219	-2.81471550119	-0.095918061791	1.68278989385	NULL	2.2955837081	1.00433497109

Quality of the predictions is spoiled by numerous false positives, which persist as the main problem for all presently available TFBS search methods.Results:We suggest a novel approach, which is alternative to widely used position weight matrices (PWMs) and Hidden Markov Models. Each motif of the input set is used as a search template to scan a query sequence. Found motifs are assigned scores depending on the non-randomness of the motif's occurrence, the number of matching searching motifs and the number of mismatches. The non-randomness is estimated by comparison of observed numbers of matching motifs with those predicted to occur by chance. The latter can be calculated given the base compositions of the motif and the query sequence. The method does not require preliminary alignment of the input motifs, hence avoiding uncertainties introduced by the alignment procedure. In comparison with PWM-based tools, our method demonstrates higher precision by the same sensitivity and specificity. It also tends to outperform methods combining pattern and PWM search. Most important, it allows reducing the number of false positive predictions significantly.Availability:The method is implemented in a tool called SiTaR (Site Tracking and Recognition) and is available athttp://sbi.hki-jena.de/sitar/index.php.Contact:ekaterina.shelest@hki-jena.deSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	743	959	416	2111	234	0.324105439029	0.311635145762	0.272850115559	0.250534827909	0.641874121582	2.54631341516	1.34644255022	NULL	2.36966875969	-0.0627554064084

They usually manifest in toddlers and infants, although they can also occur much later in life. Information about PIDs is often widely scattered throughout the clinical as well as the research literature and hard to find for both generalists as well as experienced clinicians. Semantic Web technologies coupled to clinical information systems can go some way toward addressing this problem. Ontologies are a central component of such a system, containing and centralizing knowledge about primary immunodeficiencies in both a human- and computer-comprehensible form. The development of an ontology of PIDs is therefore a central step toward developing informatics tools, which can support the clinician in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.Results:We present PIDO, the primary immunodeficiency disease ontology. PIDO characterizes PIDs in terms of the phenotypes commonly observed by clinicians during a diagnosis process. Phenotype terms in PIDO are formally defined using complex definitions based on qualities, functions, processes and structures. We provide mappings to biomedical reference ontologies to ensure interoperability with ontologies in other domains. Based on PIDO, we developed the PIDFinder, an ontology-driven software prototype that can facilitate clinical decision support. PIDO connects immunological knowledge across resources within a common framework and thereby enables translational research and the development of medical applications for the domain of immunology and primary immunodeficiency diseases.Availability:The Primary Immunodeficiency Disease Ontology is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC-BY 3.0) licence athttp://code.google.com/p/pido/.

823	http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/software/tfrank/	824	NULL	TFRank	Motivation:Uncovering mechanisms underlying gene expression control is crucial to understand complex cellular responses. Studies in gene regulation often aim to identify regulatory players involved in a biological process of interest, either transcription factors coregulating a set of target genes or genes eventually controlled by a set of regulators. These are frequently prioritized with respect to a context-specific relevance score. Current approaches rely on relevance measures accounting exclusively for direct transcription factor–target interactions, namely overrepresentation of binding sites or target ratios. Gene regulation has, however, intricate behavior with overlapping, indirect effect that should not be neglected. In addition, the rapid accumulation of regulatory data already enables the prediction of large-scale networks suitable for higher level exploration by methods based on graph theory. A paradigm shift is thus emerging, where isolated and constrained analyses will likely be replaced by whole-network, systemic-aware strategies.Results:We present TFRank, a graph-based framework to prioritize regulatory players involved in transcriptional responses within the regulatory network of an organism, whereby every regulatory path containing genes of interest is explored and incorporated into the analysis. TFRank selected important regulators of yeast adaptation to stress induced by quinine and acetic acid, which were missed by a direct effect approach. Notably, they reportedly confer resistance toward the chemicals. In a preliminary study in human, TFRank unveiled regulators involved in breast tumor growth and metastasis when applied to genes whose expression signatures correlated with short interval to metastasis.Availability:Prototype athttp://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/software/tfrank/.Contact:jpg@kdbio.inesc-id.pt;sara.madeira@ist.utl.pt;Supplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	753	103	2034	555	163	0.231072845489	0.170516365104	0.164830719267	0.164530131417	0.286449776719	1.2217235167	0.395373862612	NULL	-0.419791989436	1.86838164154

827	http://www.flyexpress.net	828	NULL	FlyExpress	Summary:Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual mining of images fromDrosophila melanogasterembryogenesis. By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections, users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage. Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific community.Availability:http://www.flyexpress.netContact:s.kumar@asu.edu	4.0	4	757	863	27	381	1104	0.204263780585	0.187005583795	0.17994830247	0.164830781114	-0.0705261110951	-0.567180421282	-0.827624143716	NULL	-1.86705117644	0.477862292198

Different alignments on the same set of unaligned sequences are often compared, sometimes in order to assess the accuracy of alignment methods or to infer a consensus alignment from a set of estimated alignments.Three of the standard techniques for comparing alignments, Developer, Modeler and Total Column (TC) scores can be derived through calculations of the set of homologies that the alignments share. However, the brute-force technique for calculating this set is quadratic in the input size. The remaining standard technique, Cline Shift Score, inherently requires quadratic time.Results:In this article, we prove that each of these scores can be computed in linear time, and we present FastSP, a linear-time algorithm for calculating these scores. Even on the largest alignments we explored (one with 50 000 sequences), FastSP completed <2 min and used at most 2 GB of the main memory. The best alternative isqscore, a method whose empirical running time is approximately the same as FastSP when given sufficient memory (at least 8 GB), but whose asymptotic running time has never been theoretically established. In addition, for comparisons of large alignments under lower memory conditions (at most 4 GB of main memory),qscoreuses substantial memory (up to 10 GB for the datasets we studied), took more time and failed to analyze the largest datasets.Availability:The open-source software and executables are available online athttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/fastsp/.Contact:tandy@cs.utexas.edu	2.0	4	758	1078	999	168	2218	0.2216746797	0.207990975791	0.198425249709	0.195947158916	2.3531970644	-1.1935626884	-0.0304352816843	NULL	0.915935129285	-1.93570675074

Automating parts of it is of great importance for the further development of ontologies and for biocuration.Results:We have developed theDresden Ontology Generator for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DOG4DAG), a system which supports the creation and extension of OBO ontologies by semi-automatically generating terms, definitions and parent–child relations from text in PubMed, the web and PDF repositories. DOG4DAG is seamlessly integrated into OBO-Edit. It generates terms by identifying statistically significant noun phrases in text. For definitions and parent–child relations it employs pattern-based web searches. We systematically evaluate each generation step using manually validated benchmarks. The term generation leads to high-quality terms also found in manually created ontologies. Up to 78% of definitions are valid and up to 54% of child–ancestor relations can be retrieved. There is no other validated system that achieves comparable results.By combining the prediction of high-quality terms, definitions and parent–child relations with the ontology editor OBO-Edit we contribute a thoroughly validated tool for all OBO ontology engineers.Availability:DOG4DAG is available within OBO-Edit 2.1 athttp://www.oboedit.orgContact:thomas.waechter@biotec.tu-dresden.de;Supplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	761	171	2301	417	715	0.497237153117	0.318212906327	0.255109739687	0.210363123816	-0.174267241787	-3.395644664	1.42805980263	NULL	-2.12608897584	2.32040266206

They serve to integrate collective interpretations of facts scattered throughout literature. Biologists construct a pathway by reading a large number of articles and interpreting them as a consistent network, but most of the models constructed currently lack direct links to those articles. Biologists who want to check the original articles have to spend substantial amounts of time to collect relevant articles and identify the sections relevant to the pathway. Furthermore, with the scientific literature expanding by several thousand papers per week, keeping a model relevant requires a continuous curation effort. In this article, we present a system designed to integrate a pathway visualizer, text mining systems and annotation tools into a seamless environment. This will enable biologists to freely move between parts of a pathway and relevant sections of articles, as well as identify relevant papers from large text bases. The system, PathText, is developed by Systems Biology Institute, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, National Centre for Text Mining (University of Manchester) and the University of Tokyo, and is being used by groups of biologists from these locations.Contact:brian@monrovian.com.	3.0	4	762	1063	809	801	1921	0.220845523355	0.198581589472	0.174948659211	0.173288013679	1.64130109562	-0.120624805891	1.18189842345	NULL	-1.4791099966	2.2819572682

The various HTS technologies have different sequencing biases and error rates, and while most HTS technologies sequence the residues of the genome directly, generating base calls for each position, the Applied Biosystem's SOLiD platform generates dibase-coded (color space) sequences. While combining data from the various platforms should increase the accuracy of variation detection, to date there are only a few tools that can identify variants from color space data, and none that can analyze color space and regular (letter space) data together.Results:We present VARiD—a probabilistic method for variation detection from both letter- and color-space reads simultaneously. VARiD is based on a hidden Markov model and uses the forward-backward algorithm to accurately identify heterozygous, homozygous and tri-allelic SNPs, as well as micro-indels. Our analysis shows that VARiD performs better than the AB SOLiD toolset at detecting variants from color-space data alone, and improves the calls dramatically when letter- and color-space reads are combined.Availability:The toolset is freely available athttp://compbio.cs.utoronto.ca/varidContact:varid@cs.toronto.edu	1.0	4	763	636	316	2478	1396	0.202149715132	0.196791351628	0.189046592165	0.165329621627	2.45642184674	-1.64086728412	-2.40591069413	NULL	-0.552074958264	-2.97381106083
838	http://www.supertriplets.univ-montp2.fr/	839	NULL	SuperTriplets	Motivation:Phylogenetic tree-building methods use molecular data to represent the evolutionary history of genes and taxa. A recurrent problem is to reconcile the various phylogenies built from different genomic sequences into a single one. This task is generally conducted by a two-step approach whereby a binary representation of the initial trees is first inferred and then a maximum parsimony (MP) analysis is performed on it. This binary representation uses a decomposition of all source trees that is usually based on clades, but that can also be based on triplets or quartets. The relative performances of these representations have been discussed but are difficult to assess since both are limited to relatively small datasets.Results:This article focuses on the triplet-based representation of source trees. We first recall how, using this representation, the parsimony analysis is related to the median tree notion. We then introduce SuperTriplets, a new algorithm that is specially designed to optimize this alternative formulation of the MP criterion. The method avoids several practical limitations of the triplet-based binary matrix representation, making it useful to deal with large datasets. When the correct resolution of every triplet appears more often than the incorrect ones in source trees, SuperTripletswarrants to reconstruct the correct phylogeny. Both simulations and a case study on mammalian phylogenomics confirm the advantages of this approach. In both cases, SuperTripletstends to propose less resolved but more reliable supertrees than those inferred using MatrixRepresentationwith Parsimony.Availability:Online and JAVA standalone versions of SuperTripletsare available athttp://www.supertriplets.univ-montp2.fr/Contact:vincent.ranwez@univ-montp2.fr	3.0	4	764	1752	2264	91	2161	0.262750380112	0.214096720573	0.208903398189	0.19330225043	2.73294307416	1.8365349203	-0.106136857075	NULL	0.869933563147	-0.302876461034

Recently, a large number of RNA editing instances in humans have been identified using bioinformatic screens and high-throughput experimental investigations utilizing next-generation sequencing technologies. However, the available data on RNA editing are not uniform and difficult to access.Results:Here, we describe a new database DARNED (DAtabase of RNa EDiting) that provides centralized access to available published data related to RNA editing. RNA editing locations are mapped on the reference human genome. The current release of the database contains information on approximately 42 000 human genome coordinates corresponding to RNA locations that undergo RNA editing, mostly involving adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions. The data can be queried using a range of genomic coordinates, their corresponding functional localization in RNA molecules [Exons, Introns, CoDing Sequence (CDS) and UnTranslated Regions (UTRs)] and information regarding tissue/organ/cell sources where RNA editing has been observed. It is also possible to obtain RNA editing information for a specific gene or an RNA molecule using corresponding accession numbers. Search results provide information on the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) supporting edited and genomic bases, functional localization of RNA editing and existence of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Editing data can be explored in UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers, in conjunction with additional data provided by these popular genome browsers.

This article points out some issues with current methods of measuring retrieval efficacy and suggests some improvements. In particular, many studies have used the pooled receiver operating characteristic fornirrelevant records (ROCn) score, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of a ‘pooled’ ROC curve, truncated atnirrelevant records. Unfortunately, the pooled ROCnscore does not faithfully reflect actual usage of retrieval algorithms. Additionally, a pooled ROCnscore can be very sensitive to retrieval results from as little as a single query.Methods:To replace the pooled ROCnscore, we propose the Threshold Average Precision (TAP-k), a measure closely related to the well-known average precision in information retrieval, but reflecting the usage ofE-values in bioinformatics. Furthermore, in addition to conditions previously given in the literature, we introduce three new criteria that an ideal measure of retrieval efficacy should satisfy.Results:PSI-BLAST, GLOBAL, HMMER and RPS-BLAST provided examples of using the TAP-kand pooled ROCnscores to evaluate sequence retrieval algorithms. In particular, compelling examples using real data highlight the drawbacks of the pooled ROCnscore, showing that it can produce evaluations skewing far from intuitive expectations. In contrast, the TAP-ksatisfies most of the criteria desired in an ideal measure of retrieval efficacy.Availability and Implementation:The TAP-kweb server and downloadable Perl script are freely available athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Spouge/html.ncbi/tap/Contact:spouge@ncbi.nlm.nih.govSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	781	980	1519	2367	2099	0.224979148822	0.183835845698	0.139223736697	0.120827688256	2.13591727926	2.27875113256	1.13167815378	NULL	-2.33818015404	0.372261688275

The chromosomal regions affected by these rearrangements are called breakpoints, while those which have not been rearranged are called synteny blocks.

Receiving as input a list ofone2oneorthologous genes found in the genomes of two species, the method builds a set of reliable and non-overlapping synteny blocks and refines the regions that are not contained into them. Through the alignment of each breakpoint sequence against its specific orthologous sequences in the other species, we can look for weak similarities inside the breakpoint, thus extending the synteny blocks and narrowing the breakpoints. The identification of the narrowed breakpoints relies on a segmentation algorithm and is statistically assessed.

Savant was developed for visualizing and analyzing HTS data, with special care taken to enable dynamic visualization in the presence of gigabases of genomic reads and references the size of the human genome. Savant supports the visualization of genome-based sequence, point, interval and continuous datasets, and multiple visualization modes that enable easy identification of genomic variants (including single nucleotide polymorphisms, structural and copy number variants), and functional genomic information (e.g. peaks in ChIP-seq data) in the context of genomic annotations.Availability:Savant is freely available athttp://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/savantContact:savant@cs.toronto.edu	8.0	4	794	2472	1396	316	490	0.190632015086	0.184722576929	0.16987363401	0.169724788993	1.39233221972	-1.64546337528	-0.372194355941	NULL	-0.760422603781	-1.36776595786

One way to improve accuracy in motif discovery is to rely on positional priors to focus the search to parts of a sequence that are considered more likely to contain functional binding sites. We present here a program called PriorsEditor that can be used to create such positional priors tracks based on a combination of several features, including phylogenetic conservation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, physical properties of the DNA helix and many more.Availability:PriorsEditor is available as a web start application and downloadable archive fromhttp://tare.medisin.ntnu.no/priorseditor(requires Java 1.6).

The rapid accumulation of protein–protein complex structures provides an unprecedented opportunity for comparative studies of protein–protein interactions. To facilitate such studies, it is necessary to develop an accurate and efficient computational algorithm for the comparison of protein–protein interaction modes. While there are many structural comparison approaches developed for individual proteins, very few methods are available for protein–protein complexes.Results:We present a novelinterfacealignment method, iAlign, for the structural alignment of protein–protein interfaces. New scoring schemes for measuring interface similarity are introduced, and an iterative dynamic programming algorithm is implemented. We find that the similarity scores follow extreme value distributions. Using statistical models, we empirically estimate their statistical significance, which is in good agreement with manual classifications by human experts. Large-scale tests of iAlign were conducted on both artificial docking models and experimental structures. In a benchmark test on 1517 dimers, iAlign successfully detects biologically related, structurally similar protein–protein interfaces at a coverage percentage of 90% and an error per query of 0.05.

While a wide range of hit identification techniques exist, little information is available about their sensitivity and specificity, especially in comparison to each other. To address this, we have developed the open-source NoiseMaker software tool for generation of realistically noisy virtual screens. By applying potential hit identification methods to NoiseMaker-simulated data and determining how many of the pre-defined true hits are recovered (as well as how many known non-hits are misidentified as hits), one can draw conclusions about the likely performance of these techniques on real data containing unknown true hits. Such simulations apply to a range of screens, such as those using small molecules, siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNA mimics or inhibitors, or gene over-expression; we demonstrate this utility by using it to explain apparently conflicting reports about the performance of the B score hit identification method.Availability and implementation:NoiseMaker is written in C#, an ECMA and ISO standard language with compilers for multiple operating systems.

DMDM provides a unique domain-level view where all human coding mutations are mapped on the protein domain. To build DMDM, all human proteins were aligned to a database of conserved protein domains using a Hidden Markov Model-based sequence alignment tool (HMMer). The resulting protein-domain alignments were used to provide a domain location for all available human disease mutations and polymorphisms. The number of disease mutations and polymorphisms in each domain position are displayed alongside other relevant functional information (e.g. the binding and catalytic activity of the site and the conservation of that domain location). DMDM's protein domain view highlights molecular relationships among mutations from different diseases that might not be clearly observed with traditional gene-centric visualization tools.Availability:Freely available athttp://bioinf.umbc.edu/dmdmContact:mkann@umbc.edu	4.0	4	818	1259	1974	1811	1911	0.392681055615	0.332268091857	0.310446324337	0.307158784733	-3.34264446902	0.969184298581	1.33868932802	NULL	2.56457602325	-0.0023108467562

Such experiments provide hundreds to thousands of potential binding sites for a given transcription factor in proximity to gene coding regions.Results:In order to integrate data from such studies and utilize it for further biological discovery, we collected interactions from such experiments to construct a mammalian ChIP-X database. The database contains 189 933 interactions, manually extracted from 87 publications, describing the binding of 92 transcription factors to 31 932 target genes. We used the database to analyze mRNA expression data where we perform gene-list enrichment analysis using the ChIP-X database as the prior biological knowledge gene-list library. The system is delivered as a web-based interactive application called ChIP Enrichment Analysis (ChEA). With ChEA, users can input lists of mammalian gene symbols for which the program computes over-representation of transcription factor targets from the ChIP-X database. The ChEA database allowed us to reconstruct an initial network of transcription factors connected based on shared overlapping targets and binding site proximity. To demonstrate the utility of ChEA we present three case studies. We show how by combining the Connectivity Map (CMAP) with ChEA, we can rank pairs of compounds to be used to target specific transcription factor activity in cancer cells.Availability:The ChEA software and ChIP-X database is freely available online at:http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/lib/chea.jspContact:avi.maayan@mssm.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	20.0	5	820	1082	1231	629	1984	0.431734530752	0.298841032056	0.270606123453	0.260530847423	-0.320805503331	3.02267599649	-0.143482478149	NULL	-0.397226959064	-0.648591572982

However, predicting PPIs usingin silicodocking techniques is computationally very expensive. Developing very fast protein docking tools will be useful for studying large-scale PPI networks, and could contribute to the rational design of new drugs.Results:TheHexspherical polar Fourier protein docking algorithm has been implemented on Nvidia graphics processor units (GPUs). On a GTX 285 GPU, an exhaustive and densely sampled 6D docking search can be calculated in just 15 s using multiple 1D fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). This represents a 45-fold speed-up over the corresponding calculation on a single CPU, being at least two orders of magnitude times faster than a similar CPU calculation using ZDOCK 3.0.1, and estimated to be at least three orders of magnitude faster than the GPU-accelerated version of PIPER on comparable hardware. Hence, for the first time, exhaustive FFT-based protein docking calculations may now be performed in a matter of seconds on a contemporary GPU. Three-dimensionalHexFFT correlations are also accelerated by the GPU, but the speed-up factor of only 2.5 is much less than that obtained with 1D FFTs. Thus, theHexalgorithm appears to be especially well suited to exploit GPUs compared to conventional 3D FFT docking approaches.Availability:http://hex.loria.fr/andhttp://hexserver.loria.fr/Contact:dave.ritchie@loria.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	15.0	4	821	560	1824	1184	1802	0.27380546697	0.244787534609	0.232188461501	0.199218924317	-2.62461324624	2.36777668508	1.53899335065	NULL	2.4997631728	-0.804610426444

This triggers the need for fast and accurate alignment software. Common techniques often restrict indels in the alignment to improve speed, whereas more flexible aligners are too slow for large-scale applications. Moreover, many current aligners are becoming inefficient as generated reads grow ever larger. Our goal with our new aligner GASSST (Global Alignment Short Sequence Search Tool) is thus 2-fold—achieving high performance with no restrictions on the number of indels with a design that is still effective on long reads.Results:We propose a new efficient filtering step that discards most alignments coming from the seed phase before they are checked by the costly dynamic programming algorithm. We use a carefully designed series of filters of increasing complexity and efficiency to quickly eliminate most candidate alignments in a wide range of configurations. The main filter uses a precomputed table containing the alignment score of short four base words aligned against each other. This table is reused several times by a new algorithm designed to approximate the score of the full dynamic programming algorithm. We compare the performance of GASSST against BWA, BFAST, SSAHA2 and PASS.

To compare large RNA 3D structures, accurate automatic comparison tools are needed. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm and web server to align large homologous RNA structures nucleotide by nucleotide using local superpositions that accommodate the flexibility of RNA molecules. Local alignments are merged to form a global alignment by employing a maximum clique algorithm on a specially defined graph that we call the ‘local alignment’ graph.Results:The algorithm is implemented in a program suite and web server called ‘R3D Align’. The R3D Align alignment of homologous 3D structures of 5S, 16S and 23S rRNA was compared to a high-quality hand alignment. A full comparison of the 16S alignment with the other state-of-the-art methods is also provided. The R3D Align program suite includes new diagnostic tools for the structural evaluation of RNA alignments. The R3D Align alignments were compared to those produced by other programs and were found to be the most accurate, in comparison with a high quality hand-crafted alignment and in conjunction with a series of other diagnostics presented. The number of aligned base pairs as well as measures of geometric similarity are used to evaluate the accuracy of the alignments.Availability:R3D Align is freely available through a web serverhttp://rna.bgsu.edu/R3DAlign.

The Sec codon is UGA, which is normally a stop codon. In selenoproteins, UGA is recoded to Sec in presence of specific features on selenoprotein gene transcripts. Due to the dual role of the UGA codon, selenoprotein prediction and annotation are difficult tasks, and even known selenoproteins are often misannotated in genome databases.Results:We present an homology-basedin silicomethod to scan genomes for members of the known eukaryotic selenoprotein families: selenoprofiles. The core of the method is a set of manually curated highly reliable multiple sequence alignments of selenoprotein families, which are used as queries to scan genomic sequences. Results of the scan are processed through a number of steps, to produce highly accurate predictions of selenoprotein genes with little or no human intervention. Selenoprofiles is a valuable tool for bioinformatic characterization of eukaryotic selenoproteomes, and can complement genome annotation pipelines.Availability and Implementation:Selenoprofiles is a python-built pipeline that internally runs psitblastn, exonerate, genewise, SECISearch and a number of custom-made scripts and programs.

A critical step in elucidating miRNA function is identifying potential miRNA targets. However, few reliable tools have been developed for identifying miRNA targets in plants.Results:Here, we developed a Smith–Waterman-like alignment tool in order to accurately predict miRNA targets. Dynamic programming was used to build a score matrix based on the complementarity of nucleotides in order to trace the optimal local alignments. Important parameters, such as maximum mismatches and maximum consecutive mismatches between miRNAs and their targets, were also used for filtering the optimal local alignments. Almost all of the parameters in this alignment tool can be adjusted by users. Compared to other target prediction tools, Target-align exhibits strong sensitivity and accuracy for identifying miRNA targets. More importantly, Target-align can identify multi-target sites as well potential for non-cleaved targets sites by change the default settings.

The spatially explicit simulation framework can account for environmental heterogeneity and fluctuations, and it can manage multiple population sources. A coalescent-based approach is used to generate genetic markers mostly used in population genetics studies (DNA sequences, SNPs, STRs or RFLPs). Various combinations of independent, fully or partially linked genetic markers can be produced under a recombination model based on the ancestral recombination graph. Competition between two populations (or species) can also be simulated with user-defined levels of admixture between the two populations. SPLATCHE2 may be used to generate the expected genetic diversity under complex demographic scenarios and can thus serve to test null hypotheses. For model parameter estimation, SPLATCHE2 can easily be integrated into an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework.Availability and implementation:SPLATCHE2 is a C++ program compiled for Windows and Linux platforms.

It has evolved very quickly during the last decade. However, metabolomics datasets are considered highly complex when used to relate metabolite levels to metabolic pathway activity. Despite recent developments in bioinformatics, which have improved the quality of metabolomics data, there is still no straightforward method capable of correlating metabolite level to the activity of different metabolic pathways operating within the cells. Thus, this kind of analysis still depends on extremely laborious and time-consuming processes.Results:Here, we present a new algorithm Pathway Activity Profiling (PAPi) with which we are able to compare metabolic pathway activities from metabolite profiles. The applicability and potential of PAPi was demonstrated using a previously published data from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. PAPi was able to support the biological interpretations of the previously published observations and, in addition, generated new hypotheses in a straightforward manner. However, PAPi is time consuming to perform manually. Thus, we also present here a new R-software package (PAPi) which implements the PAPi algorithm and facilitates its usage to quickly compare metabolic pathways activities between different experimental conditions. Using the identified metabolites and their respective abundances as input, the PAPi package calculates pathways' Activity Scores, which represents the potential metabolic pathways activities and allows their comparison between conditions. PAPi also performs principal components analysis and analysis of variance ort-test to investigate differences in activity level between experimental conditions. In addition, PAPi generates comparative graphs highlighting up- and down-regulated pathway activity.Availability:These datasets are available inhttp://www.4shared.com/file/hTWyndYU/extra.htmlandhttp://www.4shared.com/file/VbQIIDeu/intra.html.

One reason for this is current methods for automated calling of genotypes are based on clustering approaches which require a large number of samples to be analyzed simultaneously, or an extensive training dataset to seed clusters. In systems where inbred samples are of primary interest, current clustering approaches perform poorly due to the inability to clearly identify a heterozygote cluster.Results:As part of the development of two custom single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping products forOryza sativa(domestic rice), we have developed a new genotype calling algorithm called ‘ALCHEMY’ based on statistical modeling of the raw intensity data rather than modelless clustering. A novel feature of the model is the ability to estimate and incorporate inbreeding information on a per sample basis allowing accurate genotyping of both inbred and heterozygous samples even when analyzed simultaneously.

More generally, the TURNIP software ascertains degrees of variation between large tandem repeats within a single locus, offering insights into mechanisms of genome stability and gene conversion in any organism for which genome sequence data are available.Availability:The TURNIP source code, results files and online help are available athttp://www.ncyc.co.uk/software/turnip.html.Contact:robert.davey@bbsrc.ac.uk	0.0	4	852	338	1275	149	700	0.11450231891	0.104177034975	0.0983048138692	0.0906454687345	0.145587091718	-3.0388715387	-2.19610539103	NULL	1.89162126368	0.417078317788

It highlights functionally important residues that are either specific to one of the two alignments or conserved across both alignments. It permits visualization of this information in three complementary ways: by colour-coding alignment positions, by sequence logos and optionally by colour-coding the residues of a protein structure provided by the user. This can aid in the detection of residues that are involved in the subtype-specific interaction with a ligand, other proteins or nucleic acids. Spial may also be used to detect residues that may be post-translationally modified in one of the two sets of sequences.Availability:http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/spial/; supplementary information is available athttp://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/spial/help.htmlContact:ajv@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk	1.0	4	853	1050	196	11	377	0.210445620448	0.192988766839	0.164306209429	0.163263488919	-0.440524425483	-1.20477623298	2.7742967011	NULL	1.51547887651	0.0449361900043

Typically, approaches look for enrichment of words in the 3′UTR sequences of the most deregulated genes. A number of tools are available for this purpose, but they require either in-depth computational knowledge, filtered 3′UTR sequences for the genome of interest, or a set of genes acquired through an arbitrary expression cutoff. To this end, we have developedSylArray; a web-based resource designed for the analysis of large-scale expression datasets. It simply requires the user to submit a sorted list of genes from an expression experiment. SylArray utilizes curated sets of 3′UTRs to attach sequences to these genes and then applies the Sylamer algorithm for detection of miRNA or siRNA signatures in those sequences. An intuitive system for visualization and interpretation of the small RNA signatures is included.Availability:SylArray is written in Perl-CGI, Perl and Java and also uses the R statistical package.

934	http://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/rapid	935	NULL	RAPID	Motivation:In complex disorders, independently evolving locus pairs might interact to confer disease susceptibility, with only a modest effect at each locus. With genome-wide association studies on large cohorts, testing all pairs for interaction confers a heavy computational burden, and a loss of power due to large Bonferroni-like corrections. Correspondingly, limiting the tests to pairs that show marginal effect at either locus, also has reduced power. Here, we describe an algorithm that discovers interacting locus pairs without explicitly testing all pairs, or requiring a marginal effect at each locus. The central idea is a mathematical transformation that maps ‘statistical correlation between locus pairs’ to ‘distance between two points in a Euclidean space’. This enables the use of geometric properties to identify proximal points (correlated locus pairs), without testing each pair explicitly. For large datasets (∼106SNPs), this reduces the number of tests from1012to106, significantly reducing the computational burden, without loss of power. The speed of the test allows for correction using permutation-based tests. The algorithm is encoded in a tool calledRapid(RApid Pair IDentification) for identifying paired interactions in case–control GWAS.Results:We validatedRapidwith extensive tests on simulated and real datasets. On simulated models of interaction,Rapideasily identified pairs with small marginal effects. On the benchmark disease, datasets from The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium,Rapidran in about 1 CPU-hour per dataset, and identified many significant interactions. In many cases, the interacting loci were known to be important for the disease, but were not individually associated in the genome-wide scan.Availability:http://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/rapidContact:vbafna@cs.ucsd.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	856	1916	981	1302	1011	0.249776370128	0.221027619041	0.213842237083	0.192666153159	-0.902209710161	2.21880435124	-1.99801267967	NULL	0.80165068507	1.70155911495

Moreover, sequence reads from a specific individual can contain sufficient information to potentially identify and genetically characterize that person, raising privacy concerns. In order to address these issues, we have developed the Mapped Read Format (MRF), a compact data summary format for both short and long read alignments that enables the anonymization of confidential sequence information, while allowing one to still carry out many functional genomics studies. We have developed a suite of tools (RSEQtools) that use this format for the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments. These tools consist of a set of modules that perform common tasks such as calculating gene expression values, generating signal tracks of mapped reads and segmenting that signal into actively transcribed regions. Moreover, the tools can readily be used to build customizable RNA-Seq workflows. In addition to the anonymization afforded by MRF, this format also facilitates the decoupling of the alignment of reads from downstream analyses.Availability and implementation:RSEQtools is implemented in C and the source code is available athttp://rseqtools.gersteinlab.org/.Contact:lukas.habegger@yale.edu;mark.gerstein@yale.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	7.0	4	859	1087	1833	1041	730	0.214561164511	0.199857803409	0.18350336914	0.17284671488	1.87746417938	-1.90078299394	-1.8922963429	NULL	-1.0467916519	-2.68762344867

Since comparative methods have already been useful in RNA structure determination, we assume that conserved RNA–RNA interactions also imply conserved function. Of these, we further assume that a non-negligible amount of the existing RNA–RNA interactions have also acquired compensating base changes throughout evolution. We implement a method,PETcofold, that can take covariance information inintra-molecular andinter-molecular base pairs into account to predict interactions and secondary structures of two multiple alignments of RNA sequences.Results:PETcofold's ability to predict RNA–RNA interactions was evaluated on a carefully curated dataset of 32 bacterial small RNAs and their targets, which was manually extracted from the literature. For evaluation of both RNA–RNA interaction and structure prediction, we were able to extract only a few high-quality examples: one vertebrate small nucleolar RNA and four bacterial small RNAs. For these we show that the prediction can be improved by our comparative approach. Furthermore,PETcofoldwas evaluated on controlled data with phylogenetically simulated sequences enriched for covariance patterns at the interaction sites.

The input is a multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree that also contains the target species. For this target species, the algorithm computes nucleotide probabilities at each sequence position. Consensus sequences are then reconstructed based on a certain confidence level.

When considering only nucleotides above a confidence limit,maxAlikeis significantly better (up to 10%) in all 44 species. The improved sequence reconstruction also leads to an increase of the quality of PCR primer design for yet unsequenced genes: the differences between the expectedTmand realTmof the primer-template duplex can be reduced by~26% compared with other reconstruction approaches.

The core engine ofESS++ for the selection of relevant predictors is based on Evolutionary Monte Carlo. Our implementation is open source, allowing community-based alterations and improvements.Availability:C++ source code and documentation including compilation instructions are available under GNU licence athttp://bgx.org.uk/software/ESS.html.Contact:l.bottolo@imperial.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	870	2116	2272	1988	1899	0.169901004681	0.12492644656	0.117810525318	0.11493838254	-0.547392023376	-0.877411367848	-0.042520102435	NULL	-1.30375166609	1.7569137617
949	http://code.google.com/p/midia	950	NULL	MIDIA	Motivation:Understanding the encoding and propagation of information by biochemical reaction networks and the relationship of such information processing properties to modular network structure is of fundamental importance in the study of cell signalling and regulation. However, a rigorous, automated approach for general biochemical networks has not been available, and high-throughput analysis has therefore been out of reach.Results:Modularization Identification by Dynamic Independence Algorithms (MIDIA) is a user-friendly, extensible R package that performs automated analysis of how information is processed by biochemical networks. An important component is the algorithm's ability to identify exact network decompositions based on both the mass action kinetics and informational properties of the network. These modularizations are visualized using a tree structure from which important dynamic conditional independence properties can be directly read. Only partial stoichiometric information needs to be used as input to MIDIA, and neither simulations nor knowledge of rate parameters are required. When applied to a signalling network, for example, the method identifies the routes and species involved in the sequential propagation of information between its multiple inputs and outputs. These routes correspond to the relevant paths in the tree structure and may be further visualized using the Input–Output Path Matrix tool. MIDIA remains computationally feasible for the largest network reconstructions currently available and is straightforward to use with models written in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).Availability:The package is distributed under the GNU General Public License and is available, together with a link to browsable Supplementary Material, athttp://code.google.com/p/midia.

In contrast to competing procedures, the testing procedure underlying DiNAMIC is carefully motivated, and employs a novel cyclic permutation scheme.

958	http://sv.gersteinlab.org/age	959	NULL	AGE	Motivation:Defining the precise location of structural variations (SVs) at single-nucleotide breakpoint resolution is an important problem, as it is a prerequisite for classifying SVs, evaluating their functional impact and reconstructing personal genome sequences. Given approximate breakpoint locations and a bridging assembly or split read, the problem essentially reduces to finding a correct sequence alignment. Classical algorithms for alignment and their generalizations guarantee finding the optimal (in terms of scoring) global or local alignment of two sequences. However, they cannot generally be applied to finding the biologically correct alignment of genomic sequences containing SVs because of the need to simultaneously span the SV (e.g. make a large gap) and perform precise local alignments at the flanking ends.Results:Here, we formulate the computations involved in this problem and describe a dynamic-programming algorithm for its solution. Specifically, our algorithm, called AGE for Alignment with Gap Excision, finds the optimal solution by simultaneously aligning the 5′ and 3′ ends of two given sequences and introducing a ‘large-gap jump’ between the local end alignments to maximize the total alignment score. We also describe extensions allowing the application of AGE to tandem duplications, inversions and complex events involving two large gaps. We develop a memory-efficient implementation of AGE (allowing application to long contigs) and make it available as a downloadable software package. Finally, we applied AGE for breakpoint determination and standardization in the 1000 Genomes Project by aligning locally assembled contigs to the human genome.Availability and Implementation:AGE is freely available athttp://sv.gersteinlab.org/age.Contact:pi@gersteinlab.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	6.0	4	880	2006	1603	999	896	0.236978200041	0.210344678436	0.209350369699	0.20727557864	1.88619675574	-0.768975422234	-2.72318551508	NULL	0.392426149416	-2.64688441772

Text-based model definition languages allow researchers to create models simply, and then export them to a common exchange format. Modular languages allow researchers to create and combine complex models more easily. We saw a use for a modular text-based language, together with a translation library to allow other programs to read the models as well.Summary:The Antimony language provides a way for a researcher to use simple text statements to create, import, and combine biological models, allowing complex models to be built from simpler models, and provides a special syntax for the creation of modular genetic networks.

New genome datasets are included into IMG ER prior to their public release either with their native annotations or with annotations generated by IMG ER's annotation pipeline.

976	http://biocomp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/new/GR_Aligner.htm	977	NULL	GR-Aligner	Motivation:Homologous genomic sequences between species usually contain different rearrangement events. Whether some specific patterns existed in the breakpoint regions that caused such events to occur is still unclear. To resolve this question, it is necessary to determine the location of breakpoints at the nucleotide level. The availability of sequences near breakpoints would further facilitate the related studies. We thus need a tool that can identify breakpoints and align the neighboring sequences. Although local alignment tools can detect rearrangement events, they only report a set of discontinuous alignments, where the detailed alignments in the breakpoint regions are usually missing. Global alignment tools are even less appropriate for these tasks since most of them are designed to align the conserved regions between sequences in a consistent order, i.e. they do not consider rearrangement events.Results:We propose an effective and efficient pairwise sequence alignment algorithm, called GR-Aligner (Genomic Rearrangement Aligner), which can find breakpoints of rearrangement events by integrating the forward and reverse alignments of the breakpoint regions flanked by homologously rearranged sequences. In addition, GR-Aligner also provides an option to view the alignments of sequences extended to the breakpoints. These outputs provide materials for studying possible evolutionary mechanisms and biological functionalities of the rearrangement.Availability:http://biocomp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/new/GR_Aligner.htmContact:arthur@iis.sinica.edu.tw	0.0	4	896	787	999	880	836	0.368926955951	0.214458391537	0.20727557864	0.205207212951	2.05029786507	-0.660766342205	-0.844539811509	NULL	0.568696523776	-1.75027518977

978	http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/PathTutorial	979	NULL	Path	Summary:Traditional methods of genetic study design and analysis work well under the scenario that a handful of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently contribute to the risk of disease. For complex diseases, susceptibility may be determined not by a single SNP, but rather a complex interplay between SNPs. For large studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, a brute force search of all possible combinations of SNPs associated with disease is not only inefficient, but also results in a multiple testing paradigm, whereby larger and larger sample sizes are needed to maintain statistical power. Pathway-based methods are an example of one of the many approaches in identifying a subset of SNPs to test for interaction. To help determine which SNP–SNP interactions to test, we developed Path, a software application designed to help researchers interface their data with biological information from several bioinformatics resources. To this end, our application brings together currently available information from nine online bioinformatics resources including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), UCSC Genome Browser, Seattle SNPs, PharmGKB, Genetic Association Database, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) and the Innate Immune Database (IIDB).Availability:The software, example datasets and tutorials are freely available fromhttp://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/PathTutorial.Contact:ddaley@mrl.ubc.ca	1.0	4	898	1036	1011	137	953	0.413085386708	0.342237262566	0.331109598938	0.315403405448	-1.66136923723	1.81262653866	-2.51903905826	NULL	1.13048875746	1.56526589538

Given the huge number of possible substitutions, every protein engineering project would benefit strongly from the guidance ofin silicomethods able to predict rapidly, and with reasonable accuracy, the stability changes resulting from all possible mutations in a protein.Results:We exploit newly developed statistical potentials, based on a formalism that highlights the coupling between four protein sequence and structure descriptors, and take into account the amino acid volume variation upon mutation. The stability change is expressed as a linear combination of these energy functions, whose proportionality coefficients vary with the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue and are identified with the help of a neural network. A correlation coefficient ofR= 0.63 and a root mean square error of σc= 1.15 kcal/mol between measured and predicted stability changes are obtained upon cross-validation.

The latter are groups of amino acids behaving as approximately rigid units in the course of protein equilibrium fluctuations. The PiSQRD server takes as input a biomolecular structure and the desired fraction of protein internal fluctuations that must be accounted for by the relative rigid-body motion of the dynamical domains. Next, the lowest energy modes of fluctuation of the protein (optionally provided by the user) are calculated and used to identify the rigid subunits. The resulting optimal subdivision is returned through a web page containing both interactive graphics and detailed data output.Availability:The PiSQRD web server, which requires Java, is available free of charge for academic users athttp://pisqrd.escience-lab.org.Contact:potestio@sissa.it	3.0	4	910	1184	2119	1974	561	0.155675871494	0.151393217481	0.134214614174	0.12541680687	-2.71370847618	1.96946988704	1.67577024238	NULL	2.78741927079	-0.484579398051

997	http://www.cmb.usc.edu/people/andrewds/rmap	998	NULL	RMAP	Summary:We report on a major new version of the RMAP software for mapping reads from short-read sequencing technology. General improvements to accuracy and space requirements are included, along with novel functionality. Included in the RMAP software package are tools for mapping paired-end reads, mapping using more sophisticated use of quality scores, collecting ambiguous mapping locations and mapping bisulfite-treated reads.Availability:The applications described in this note are available for download athttp://www.cmb.usc.edu/people/andrewds/rmapand are distributed as Open Source software under the GPLv3.0. The software has been tested on Linux and OS X platforms.Contact:andrewds@usc.edu;mzhang@cshl.eduThe RMAP algorithm was introduced by (Smithet al.,2008) as one of the earliest available programs for mapping reads from the Illumina second-generation sequencing technology. One important contribution of RMAP was to incorporate the use of quality scores directly into the mapping process: read positions with too low a quality score were not considered while mapping, and that quality score cutoff could be adjusted by the user. Subsequently, numerous mapping algorithm have appeared (Langmeadet al.,2009; Li,H.et al.,2008; Li,R.et al.,2008; Linet al.,2008; Schatz,2009; Yanovskyet al.,2008), with improvements in both efficiency and breadth of functionality (e.g. ability to map paired-end reads; integrated SNP calling). Investigators requiring solutions to mapping problems now have many options. As new applications of short-read sequencing emerge, many variations on the analysis task of read mapping emerge. Diversity in performance characteristics of existing mapping tools becomes potentially valuable.We report the first major update to RMAP. The basic algorithmic framework in RMAP is still to preprocess reads and scan the genome, but several modifications have been made and much additional functionality has been included. Importantly, RMAP has a memory footprint that depends on the number of reads being mapped. This feature allows RMAP to be used effectively in cluster environments with commodity nodes, because partitioning the reads allows natural parallelizations with linear reduction in memory requirements per processor core used.Included in this release of the RMAP software package is functionality for mapping paired-end reads, making more sophisticated use of quality scores, collecting mapping locations for ambiguously mapping reads and mapping bisulfite-treated reads.	9.0	4	916	1064	1729	943	1188	0.29998673388	0.282512191136	0.266233466475	0.255848950318	1.98900148843	-2.12052271194	-2.65414160552	NULL	-0.929423909527	-2.99967963926

Recognizing a coiled-coil containing sequence and locating its coiled-coil domains are key steps towards the determination of the protein structure and function. Different tools are available for predicting coiled-coil domains in protein sequences, including those based on position-specific score matrices and machine learning methods.Results:In this article, we introduce a hidden Markov model (CCHMM_PROF) that exploits the information contained in multiple sequence alignments (profiles) to predict coiled-coil regions. The new method discriminates coiled-coil sequences with an accuracy of 97% and achieves a true positive rate of 79% with only 1% of false positives. Furthermore, when predicting the location of coiled-coil segments in protein sequences, the method reaches an accuracy of 80% at the residue level and a best per-segment and per-protein efficiency of 81% and 80%, respectively. The results indicate that CCHMM_PROF outperforms all the existing tools and can be adopted for large-scale genome annotation.Availability:The dataset is available athttp://www.biocomp.unibo.it/∼lisa/coiled-coils.

Such data can generally be represented in the form of multidimensional datasets [for example (time × stimulation × inhibitor × inhibitor concentration × cell type × measurement)]. For cases where measurements are made in a combinational fashion across multiple dimensions, there is a need for a tool to efficiently manipulate and reorganize such data for visualization. DataPflex accepts data consisting of up to five arbitrary dimensions in addition to a measurement dimension. Data are imported from a simple .xls format and can be exported to MATLAB or .xls. Data dimensions can be reordered, subdivided, merged, normalized and visualized in the form of collections of line graphs, bar graphs, surface plots, heatmaps, IC50’s and other custom plots.

The contribution of the traditionally overlooked copy number variations (CNVs) to complex traits is also being actively studied. To facilitate the interpretation of the data and the designing of follow-up experimental validations, we have developed a database that enables the sensible prioritization of these variants by combining several approaches, involving not only publicly available physical and functional annotations but also multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) annotations as well as annotations of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).Results:For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e.g. physical and functional annotations); and (iv) summary information from other GWAS. For each gene, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) eQTLs for the gene (both local and distant SNPs) and (ii) the coverage of all variants in the HapMap at that gene on each high-throughput platform. For each genomic region, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) physical and functional annotations of all SNPs, genes and known CNVs within the region and (ii) all genes regulated by the eQTLs within the region.Availability:http://www.scandb.orgContact:ncox@medicine.bsd.uchicago.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	16.0	4	938	953	2268	1902	1437	0.371097694069	0.304924953352	0.304694647033	0.295656315832	-1.4082074493	1.60578140456	-2.66082615366	NULL	1.00436204066	1.62821390822

Recurrent CNA (RCNA) occurs in multiple cancer samples across the same chromosomal region and has greater implication in tumorigenesis. Current commonly used methods for RCNA identification require CNA calling for individual samples before cross-sample analysis. This two-step strategy may result in a heavy computational burden, as well as a loss of the overall statistical power due to segmentation and discretization of individual sample's data. We propose a population-based approach for RCNA detection with no need of single-sample analysis, which is statistically powerful, computationally efficient and particularly suitable for high-resolution and large-population studies.Results:Our approach, correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS), identifies RCNAs based on a between-chromosomal-site correlation analysis. Directly using the raw intensity ratio data from all samples and adopting a diagonal transformation strategy, CMDS substantially reduces computational burden and can obtain results very quickly from large datasets. Our simulation indicates that the statistical power of CMDS is higher than that of single-sample CNA calling based two-step approaches. We applied CMDS to two real datasets of lung cancer and brain cancer from Affymetrix and Illumina array platforms, respectively, and successfully identified known regions of CNA associated withEGFR,KRASand other important oncogenes. CMDS provides a fast, powerful and easily implemented tool for the RCNA analysis of large-scale data from cancer genomes.Availability:The R and C programs implementing our method are available athttps://dsgweb.wustl.edu/qunyuan/software/cmds.Contact:qunyuan@wustl.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	946	2188	1812	847	2466	0.163580080626	0.14619828189	0.135390722713	0.130517477264	-0.543064019868	1.09196719729	-4.01509408424	NULL	-2.57764214294	-0.986693036257

Next, various characteristics of the predicted functional region as well as global features of the protein are calculated, such as the average surface electrostatic potential, the dipole moment and cluster-based amino acid conservation patterns. Finally, a random forests classifier is used to predict whether the query protein is likely to bind DNA and to estimate the prediction confidence. We have trained and tested the classifier on various datasets and shown that it outperformed related methods. On a dataset that reflects the fraction of DNA binding proteins (DBPs) in a proteome, the area under the ROC curve was 0.90.

1034	http://coepra.org	1035	NULL	CoEPrA	Motivation:In silicomethods to classify compounds as potential drugs that bind to a specific target become increasingly important for drug design. To build classification devices training sets of drugs with known activities are needed. For many such classification problems, not only qualitative but also quantitative information of a specific property (e.g. binding affinity) is available. The latter can be used to build a regression scheme to predict this property for new compounds. Predicting a compound property explicitly is generally more difficult than classifying that the property lies below or above a given threshold value. Hence, an indirect classification that is based on regression may lead to poorer results than a direct classification scheme. In fact, initially researchers are only interested to classify compounds as potential drugs. The activities of these compounds are subsequently measured in wet lab.Results:We propose a novel approach that uses available quantitative information directly for classification rather than first using a regression scheme. It uses a new type of loss function called weighted biased regression. Application of this method to four widely studied datasets of the CoEPrA contest (Comparative Evaluation of Prediction Algorithms,http://coepra.org) shows that it can outperform simple classification methods that do not make use of this additional quantitative information.Availability:A stand alone application is available at the webpagehttp://agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/agknapp/index.php?menu=software&page=PeptideClassifierthat can be used to build a model for a peptide training set to be submitted.Contact:odemir@chemie.fu-berlin.deSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	951	597	1522	98	2033	0.254478814085	0.202619210869	0.188590551947	0.167773739283	-0.379584589293	-0.102048848781	0.782184224243	NULL	0.394242290938	2.80108460251

Several data standards have been adopted for representing models (Systems Biology Markup Language) and various types of relevant experimental data (such as FuGE and those of the Proteomics Standards Initiative). However, until now, there has been no standard way to associate a model and its entities to the corresponding datasets, or vice versa. Such a standard would provide a means to represent computational simulation results as well as to frame experimental data in the context of a particular model. Target applications include model-driven data analysis, parameter estimation, and sharing and archiving model simulations.Results:We propose the Systems Biology Results Markup Language (SBRML), an XML-based language that associates a model with several datasets. Each dataset is represented as a series of values associated with model variables, and their corresponding parameter values. SBRML provides a flexible way of indexing the results to model parameter values, which supports both spreadsheet-like data and multidimensional data cubes. We present and discuss several examples of SBRML usage in applications such as enzyme kinetics, microarray gene expression and various types of simulation results.Availability and Implementation:The XML Schema file for SBRML is available athttp://www.comp-sys-bio.org/SBRMLunder the Academic Free License (AFL) v3.0.Contact:pedro.mendes@manchester.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	956	893	977	116	1328	0.22238636336	0.187554362434	0.186602286337	0.185974111124	1.34218898898	1.018764547	1.0196046316	NULL	-0.321308546687	1.23134029505
1040	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/	1041	NULL	GO-Bayes	Motivation:A typical approach for the interpretation of high-throughput experiments, such as gene expression microarrays, is to produce groups of genes based on certain criteria (e.g. genes that are differentially expressed). To gain more mechanistic insights into the underlying biology, overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is often conducted to investigate whether gene sets associated with particular biological functions, for example, as represented by Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, are statistically overrepresented in the identified gene groups. However, the standard ORA, which is based on the hypergeometric test, analyzes each GO term in isolation and does not take into account the dependence structure of the GO-term hierarchy.Results:We have developed a Bayesian approach (GO-Bayes) to measure overrepresentation of GO terms that incorporates the GO dependence structure by taking into account evidence not only from individual GO terms, but also from their related terms (i.e. parents, children, siblings, etc.). The Bayesian framework borrows information across related GO terms to strengthen the detection of overrepresentation signals. As a result, this method tends to identify sets of closely related GO terms rather than individual isolated GO terms. The advantage of the GO-Bayes approach is demonstrated with a simulation study and an application example.Contact:song.zhang@utsouthwestern.edu;richard.scheuermann@utsouthwestern.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	957	183	630	336	1979	0.582036791917	0.48026846767	0.412070181967	0.40551417793	1.42012478758	-1.16290871392	3.46014370035	NULL	-1.05055389502	2.9899530019

While most available clustering algorithms work well on biological networks of moderate size, such as the yeast protein physical interaction network, they either fail or are too slow in practice for larger networks, such as functional networks for higher eukaryotes. Since an increasing number of larger biological networks are being determined, the limitations of current clustering approaches curtail the types of biological network analyses that can be performed.Results:We present a fast local network clustering algorithm SPICi. SPICi runs in timeO(VlogV+E) and spaceO(E), whereVandEare the number of vertices and edges in the network, respectively. We evaluate SPICi's performance on several existing protein interaction networks of varying size, and compare SPICi to nine previous approaches for clustering biological networks. We show that SPICi is typically several orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches and is the only one that can successfully cluster all test networks within very short time.

These approaches, although significant on their own, are not effective for elucidating the synergistic qualities of the numerous components in complex diseases. These components do not act one at a time, but rather in concert with numerous others. A compelling need exists to develop analytically sound and computationally advanced methods that elucidate a more biologically meaningful understanding of the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression by taking these interactions into account.Results:We propose a novel algorithm,partDSA, for prediction when several variables jointly affect the outcome. In such settings, piecewise constant estimation provides an intuitive approach by elucidating interactions and correlation patterns in addition to main effects. As well as generating‘and’statements similar to previously described methods,partDSAexplores and chooses the best among all possible‘or’statements. The immediate benefit ofpartDSAis the ability to build a parsimonious model with‘and’and‘or’conjunctions that account for the observed biological phenomena. Importantly,partDSAis capable of handling categorical and continuous explanatory variables and outcomes.

1063	http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CROC/	1064	NULL	CROC	Motivation:The performance of classifiers is often assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC [or (AC) accumulation curve or enrichment curve] curves and the corresponding areas under the curves (AUCs). However, in many fundamental problems ranging from information retrieval to drug discovery, only the very top of the ranked list of predictions is of any interest and ROCs and AUCs are not very useful. New metrics, visualizations and optimization tools are needed to address this ‘early retrieval’ problem.Results:To address the early retrieval problem, we develop the general concentrated ROC (CROC) framework. In this framework, any relevant portion of the ROC (or AC) curve is magnified smoothly by an appropriate continuous transformation of the coordinates with a corresponding magnification factor. Appropriate families of magnification functions confined to the unit square are derived and their properties are analyzed together with the resulting CROC curves. The area under the CROC curve (AUC[CROC]) can be used to assess early retrieval. The general framework is demonstrated on a drug discovery problem and used to discriminate more accurately the early retrieval performance of five different predictors. From this framework, we propose a novel metric and visualization—the CROC(exp), an exponential transform of the ROC curve—as an alternative to other methods. The CROC(exp) provides a principled, flexible and effective way for measuring and visualizing early retrieval performance with excellent statistical power. Corresponding methods for optimizing early retrieval are also described in theAppendix.Availability:Datasets are publicly available.

In the first step, rHVDM uses a small number of known targets to derive the activity profile of a given transcription factor. Then, in a subsequent step, this activity profile is used to predict other putative targets of that transcription factor. A dynamic and mechanistic model of gene expression is at the heart of the technique. Measurement error is taken into account during the process, which allows an objective assessment of the robustness of fit and, therefore, the quality of the predictions. The package relies on efficient algorithms and vectorization to accomplish potentially time consuming tasks including optimization and differential equation integration. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of rHVDM by examining the activity of the tumour-suppressing transcription factor, p53.Availability:The version of the package presented here (1.8.1) is freely available from the Bioconductor Web site (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.3/bioc/html/rHVDM.html).Contact:m.barenco@ucl.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	984	633	1715	339	820	0.250215092054	0.240205264634	0.232959585438	0.21303222232	-0.173736410515	1.32095040274	0.0477062236248	NULL	-1.41727694195	0.363926756683

1071	http://ifatwww.et.uni-magdeburg.de/syst/ADMIT/	1072	NULL	ADMIT	Summary:Often competing hypotheses for biochemical networks exist in the form of different mathematical models with unknown parameters. Considering available experimental data, it is then desired to reject model hypotheses that are inconsistent with the data, or to estimate the unknown parameters. However, these tasks are complicated because experimental data are typically sparse, uncertain, and are frequently only available in form of qualitativeif–thenobservations. ADMIT (Analysis,Design andModelInvalidationToolbox) is a MatLabTM-based tool for guaranteed model invalidation, state and parameter estimation. The toolbox allows the integration of quantitative measurement data, a priori knowledge of parameters and states, and qualitative information on the dynamic or steady-state behavior. A constraint satisfaction problem is automatically generated and algorithms are implemented for solving the desired estimation, invalidation or analysis tasks. The implemented methods built on convex relaxation and optimization and therefore provide guaranteed estimation results and certificates for invalidity.Availability:ADMIT, tutorials and illustrative examples are available free of charge for non-commercial use athttp://ifatwww.et.uni-magdeburg.de/syst/ADMIT/Contact:stefan.streif@ovgu.de	3.0	4	987	1707	116	1852	1383	0.170944797279	0.170191291191	0.162248833432	0.157071543748	0.857481130164	1.03767455243	1.24027813397	NULL	0.0222487782697	1.16745521842

To avoid quantification bias due to mis-specification of commonly used parametric models, a nonparametric approach based on monotone response curves may be used. The existing methods, however, aggregate the protein concentration levels of replicates of each sample, and therefore fail to account for within-sample variability.Results:We propose a method of regularization on protein concentration estimation at the level of individual dilution series to account for within-sample or within-group variability. We use an efficient algorithm to optimize an approximate objective function, with a data-adaptive approach to choose the level of shrinkage. Simulation results show that the proposed method quantifies protein concentration levels well.

1078	http://smurf.cs.tufts.edu/smurflite/	1079	NULL	SMURFLite	Motivation:One of the most successful methods to date for recognizing protein sequences that are evolutionarily related has been profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). However, these models do not capture pairwise statistical preferences of residues that are hydrogen bonded in beta sheets. These dependencies have been partially captured in the HMM setting by simulated evolution in the training phase and can be fully captured by Markov random fields (MRFs). However, the MRFs can be computationally prohibitive when beta strands are interleaved in complex topologies. We introduce SMURFLite, a method that combines both simplified MRFs and simulated evolution to substantially improve remote homology detection for beta structures. Unlike previous MRF-based methods, SMURFLite is computationally feasible on any beta-structural motif.Results:We test SMURFLite on all propeller and barrel folds in the mainly-beta class of the SCOP hierarchy in stringent cross-validation experiments. We show a mean 26% (median 16%) improvement in area under curve (AUC) for beta-structural motif recognition as compared with HMMER (a well-known HMM method) and a mean 33% (median 19%) improvement as compared with RAPTOR (a well-known threading method) and even a mean 18% (median 10%) improvement in AUC over HHPred (a profile–profile HMM method), despite HHpred's use of extensive additional training data. We demonstrate SMURFLite's ability to scale to whole genomes by running a SMURFLite library of 207 beta-structural SCOP superfamilies against the entire genome ofThermotoga maritima, and make over a 100 new fold predictions.Availability and implementaion:A webserver that runs SMURFLite is available at:http://smurf.cs.tufts.edu/smurflite/Contact:lenore.cowen@tufts.edu;bab@mit.edu	1.0	4	994	1310	1825	1592	927	0.196589656532	0.186272630539	0.135949428562	0.117876866798	-3.43889042413	2.03955603803	-0.262039676005	NULL	2.80363769745	-0.733185964606

For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for eQTL analysis grows stronger.Results:We have developed a new software for computationally efficient eQTL analysis called Matrix eQTL. In tests on large datasets, it was 2–3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for QTL/eQTL analysis, while finding the same eQTLs. The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors.

However, existing high-throughput alignment tools are not designed to work effectively with multiple genome alignments.Results:We introduce PhyLAT, the phylogenetic local alignment tool, to compute local alignments of a query sequence against a fixed multiple-genome alignment of closely related species. PhyLAT uses a known phylogenetic tree on the species in the multiple alignment to improve the quality of its computed alignments while also estimating the placement of the query on this tree. It combines a probabilistic approach to alignment with seeding and expansion heuristics to accelerate discovery of significant alignments. We provide evidence, using alignments of human chromosome 22 against a five-species alignment from the UCSC Genome Browser database, that PhyLAT's alignments are more accurate than those of other commonly used programs, including BLAST, POY, MAFFT, MUSCLE and CLUSTAL. PhyLAT also identifies more alignments in coding DNA than does pairwise alignment alone.

So far, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements have been characterized, and there is great interest in applying computational techniques to systematically discover these elements. Such efforts, however, have been significantly hindered by the overwhelming size of non-coding DNA regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of mammalian regulatory elements.Results:Here we combine information from multiple mammalian genomes to derive the first fairly comprehensive map of regulatory elements in the human genome. We develop a procedure for identifying regulatory sites, with high levels of conservation across different species, using a new scoring scheme, the Bayesian branch length score (BBLS). Using BBLS, we predict 1.5 million regulatory sites, corresponding to 380 known regulatory motifs, with an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of <50%. We demonstrate that the method is particularly effective for 155 motifs, for which 121 056 sites can be mapped with an estimated FDR of <10%. Over 28K SNPs are located in regions overlapping the 1.5 million predicted motif sites, suggesting potential functional implications for these SNPs. We have deposited these elements in a database and created a user-friendly web server for the retrieval, analysis and visualization of these elements. The initial map provides a systematic view of gene regulation in the genome, which will be refined as additional motifs become available.Availability:http://motifmap.ics.uci.eduContact:xhx@ics.uci.edu;pfbaldi@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	4	1005	1119	2128	779	1599	0.270751891307	0.265079056463	0.249704991554	0.24348148169	0.60658708153	1.77870323584	0.188788752832	NULL	0.958753328278	0.0130206350719

Although choosing the best model available from a pool of alternatives has become standard practice in statistical phylogenetics, assessment of the chosen model's adequacy is rare. Programs for Bayesian phylogenetic inference have recently begun to implement models of sequence evolution that account for heterogeneity across sites beyond variation in rates of evolution, yet no program exists to assess the adequacy of these models. PuMA implements a posterior predictive simulation approach to assessing the adequacy of partitioned, unpartitioned and mixture models of DNA sequence evolution in a Bayesian context. Assessment of model adequacy allows empirical phylogeneticists to have appropriate confidence in their results and guides efforts to improve models of sequence evolution.Availability:This program is available as source code, a Java.jar application, and a native Mac OS X application.

1096	http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/SNPHarvester.html	1097	NULL	SNPHarvester	Motivation:Hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are available for genome-wide association (GWA) studies nowadays. The epistatic interactions of SNPs are believed to be very important in determining individual susceptibility to complex diseases. However, existing methods for SNP interaction discovery either suffer from high computation complexity or perform poorly when marginal effects of disease loci are weak or absent. Hence, it is desirable to develop an effective method to search epistatic interactions in genome-wide scale.Results:We propose a new method SNPHarvester to detect SNP–SNP interactions in GWA studies. SNPHarvester creates multiple paths in which the visited SNP groups tend to be statistically associated with diseases, and then harvests those significant SNP groups which pass the statistical tests. It greatly reduces the number of SNPs. Consequently, existing tools can be directly used to detect epistatic interactions. By using a wide range of simulated data and a real genome-wide data, we demonstrate that SNPHarvester outperforms its recent competitor significantly and is promising for practical disease prognosis.Availability:http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/SNPHarvester.htmlContact:eeyang@ust.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	8.0	4	1011	898	1036	137	953	0.342237262566	0.290593978249	0.270781772254	0.244852369266	-1.63965118344	1.85272332258	-2.53702891569	NULL	1.13422691658	1.63671753409

Such lists can be projected onto prior knowledge of kinase–substrate interactions to infer the list of kinases associated with a specific protein list. By computing how the proportion of kinases, associated with a specific list of proteins/genes, deviates from an expected distribution, we can rank kinases and kinase families based on the likelihood that these kinases are functionally associated with regulating the cell under specific experimental conditions. Such analysis can assist in producing hypotheses that can explain how the kinome is involved in the maintenance of different cellular states and can be manipulated to modulate cells towards a desired phenotype.Summary:Kinase enrichment analysis (KEA) is a web-based tool with an underlying database providing users with the ability to link lists of mammalian proteins/genes with the kinases that phosphorylate them.

In eukaryotes, its co-translational recoding requires the presence of an RNA stem–loop structure, the SECIS element in the 3 untranslated region of (UTR) selenoprotein mRNAs. Despite little sequence conservation, SECIS elements share the same overall secondary structure. Until recently, the lack of a significantly high number of selenoprotein mRNA sequences hampered the identification of other potential sequence conservation. In this work, the web-based tool SECISaln provides for the first time an extensive structure-based sequence alignment of SECIS elements resulting from the well-defined secondary structure of the SECIS RNA and the increased size of the eukaryotic selenoproteome. We have used SECISaln to improve our knowledge of SECIS secondary structure and to discover novel, conserved nucleotide positions and we believe it will be a useful tool for the selenoprotein and RNA scientific communities.Availability:SECISaln is freely available as a web-based tool athttp://genome.crg.es/software/secisaln/.Contact:charles.chapple@crg.esSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1018	838	1234	2325	258	0.27496962565	0.183032031194	0.169537129282	0.157225198091	-4.00263680302	-0.806810829542	0.978960097992	NULL	-0.199265255217	-2.19938355667

With increasing resolution of CGH arrays, the demand for computationally efficient algorithms arises, which are effective in the detection of aberrations even in very noisy data.Results:We developed a rather simple, non-parametric technique of high computational efficiency for CGH array analysis that adopts a median absolute deviation concept for breakpoint detection, comprising median smoothing for pre-processing. The resulting algorithm has the potential to outperform any single smoothing approach as well as several recently proposed segmentation techniques. We show its performance through the application of simulated and real datasets in comparison to three other methods for array CGH analysis.Implementation:Our approach is implemented in the R-language and environment for statistical computing (version 2.6.1 for Windows, R-project, 2007).

1114	http://mom.csbc.vcu.edu	1115	NULL	MOM	Summary:Current short read mapping programs are based on the reasonable premise that most sequencing errors occur near the 3′end of the read. These programs map reads with either a small number of mismatches in the entire read, or a small number of mismatches in the segment remaining after trimming bases from the 3′end or a single base from the 5′end. Though multiple sequencing errors most likely occur near the 3′end of the reads, they can still occur at the 5′end of the reads. Trimming from the 3′end will not be able to map these reads. We have developed a program, Maximum Oligonucleotide Mapping (MOM), based on the concept of query matching that is designed to capture a maximal length match within the short read satisfying the user defined error parameters. This query matching approach thus accommodates multiple sequencing errors at both ends. We demonstrate that this technique achieves greater sensitivity and a higher percentage of uniquely mapped reads when compared to existing programs such as SOAP, MAQ and SHRiMP.Software and Test Data Availability:http://mom.csbc.vcu.eduContact:ygao@vcu.eduhleaves@vcu.edu	3.0	4	1027	943	747	2395	1833	0.327463663917	0.308107607163	0.297495089221	0.276559095234	2.1738990669	-1.67900040119	-2.78634834234	NULL	-0.741956333227	-3.05469982838
1115	http://pass.cribi.unipd.it	1116	NULL	PASS	Summary:Standard DNA alignment programs are inadequate to manage the data produced by new generation DNA sequencers. To answer this problem, we developed PASS with the objective of improving execution time and sensitivity when compared with other available programs. PASS performs fast gapped and ungapped alignments of short DNA sequences onto a reference DNA, typically a genomic sequence. It is designed to handle a huge amount of reads such as those generated by Solexa, SOLiD or 454 technologies. The algorithm is based on a data structure that holds in RAM the index of the genomic positions of ‘seed’ words (typically 11 and 12 bases) as well as an index of the precomputed scores of short words (typically seven and eight bases) aligned against each other. After building the genomic index, the program scans every query sequence performing three steps: (1) it finds matching seed words in the genome; (2) for every match checks the precomputed alignment of the short flanking regions; (3) if passes step 2, then it performs an exact dynamic alignment of a narrow region around the match. The performance of the program is very striking both for sensitivity and speed. For instance, gap alignment is achieved hundreds of times faster than BLAST and several times faster than SOAP, especially when gaps are allowed. Furthermore, PASS has a higher sensitivity when compared with the other available programs.Availability and implementation:Source code and binaries are freely available for download athttp://pass.cribi.unipd.it, implemented in C++and supported on Linux and Windows.Contact:pass@cribi.unipd.it	8.0	4	1028	2478	441	829	331	0.320753888513	0.243763960121	0.228467946902	0.218572181824	1.59957673604	-2.07943447303	-2.02935346696	NULL	-0.545508059718	-2.61817854056

Nevertheless, the tremendous number of SNPs on the human genome requires computational methods for prioritizing SNPs according to their potentially deleterious effects to human health, and as such, for expediting genotyping and analysis. As of yet, little has been done to quantitatively assess the possible deleterious effects of SNPs for effective association studies.Results:We propose a new integrative scoring system for prioritizing SNPs based on their possible deleterious effects within a probabilistic framework. We applied our system to 580 disease-susceptibility genes obtained from the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database, which is one of the most widely used databases of human genes and genetic disorders. The scoring results clearly show that the distribution of the functional significance (FS) scores for already known disease-related SNPs is significantly different from that of neutral SNPs. In addition, we summarize distinct features of potentially deleterious SNPs based on their FS score, such as functional genomic regions where they occur or bio-molecular functions that they mainly affect. We also demonstrate, through a comparative study, that our system improves upon other function-assessment systems for SNPs, by assigning significantly higher FS scores to already known disease-related SNPs than to neutral SNPs.Availability:http://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/F-SNPandhttp://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/RankingSNPs/default.html.Contact:lee@cs.queensu.ca	7.0	4	1036	898	953	375	1822	0.413085386708	0.32489269242	0.319714261178	0.316683722892	-1.68529132782	1.82684566306	-2.52194926031	NULL	1.16429781532	1.55529831164

1131	http://www.ontology.buffalo.edu/medo/UMLS_SN.pdf	1132	NULL	UMLS	Motivation:For many years, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic network (SN) has been used as an upper-level semantic framework for the categorization of terms from terminological resources in biomedicine. BioTop has recently been developed as an upper-level ontology for the biomedical domain. In contrast to the SN, it is founded upon strict ontological principles, using OWL DL as a formal representation language, which has become standard in the semantic Web. In order to make logic-based reasoning available for the resources annotated or categorized with the SN, a mapping ontology was developed aligning the SN with BioTop.Methods:The theoretical foundations and the practical realization of the alignment are being described, with a focus on the design decisions taken, the problems encountered and the adaptations of BioTop that became necessary. For evaluation purposes, UMLS concept pairs obtained from MEDLINE abstracts by a named entity recognition system were tested for possible semantic relationships. Furthermore, all semantic-type combinations that occur in the UMLS Metathesaurus were checked for satisfiability.Results:The effort-intensive alignment process required major design changes and enhancements of BioTop and brought up several design errors that could be fixed. A comparison between a human curator and the ontology yielded only a low agreement. Ontology reasoning was also used to successfully identify 133 inconsistent semantic-type combinations.Availability:BioTop, the OWL DL representation of the UMLS SN, and the mapping ontology are available athttp://www.purl.org/biotop/.Contact:stschulz@uni-freiburg.de	1.0	4	1044	2360	976	417	637	0.186489173131	0.18605658228	0.171244968731	0.167039387774	-0.289855691825	-3.31916291344	1.51153476974	NULL	-2.12452412566	2.39498440418
1132	http://protein.bio.unipd.it/repetita/	1133	NULL	REPETITA	Motivation:Proteins with solenoid repeats evolve more quickly than non-repetitive ones and their periodicity may be rapidly hidden at sequence level, while still evident in structure. In order to identify these repeats, we propose here a novel method based on a metric characterizing amino-acid properties (polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, electric charge) using five previously derived numerical functions.Results:The five spectra of the candidate sequences coding for structural repeats, obtained by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), show common features allowing determination of repeat periodicity with excellent results. Moreover it is possible to introduce a phase space parameterized by two quantities related to the Fourier spectra which allow for a clear distinction between a non-homologous set of globular proteins and proteins with solenoid repeats. The DFT method is shown to be competitive with other state of the art methods in the detection of solenoid structures, while improving its performance especially in the identification of periodicities, since it is able to recognize the actual repeat length in most cases. Moreover it highlights the relevance of local structural propensities in determining solenoid repeats.Availability:A web tool implementing the algorithm presented in the article (REPETITA) is available with additional details on the data sets at the URL:http://protein.bio.unipd.it/repetita/.Contact:silvio.tosatto@unipd.it	4.0	4	1045	611	2359	338	1761	0.525832695513	0.317579920796	0.287770839316	0.285130959719	-2.36396030418	-3.32770795193	-0.851332989777	NULL	2.61716794804	0.0248406657956

There are numerous reactions known to be present in various pathways but without any official EC numbers, most of which have no hope to be given ones because of the lack of the published articles on enzyme assays.Results:In this article we propose a new method to predict the potential EC numbers to given reactant pairs (substrates and products) or uncharacterized reactions, and a web-server named E-zyme as an application. This technology is based on our original biochemical transformation pattern which we call an ‘RDM pattern’, and consists of three steps: (i) graph alignment of a query reactant pair (substrates and products) for computing the query RDM pattern, (ii) multi-layered partial template matching by comparing the query RDM pattern with template patterns related with known EC numbers and (iii) weighted major voting scheme for selecting appropriate EC numbers. As the result, cross-validation experiments show that the proposed method achieves both high coverage and high prediction accuracy at a practical level, and consistently outperforms the previous method.Availability:The E-zyme system is available athttp://www.genome.jp/tools/e-zyme/Contact:kanehisa@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp	3.0	4	1046	2473	2085	1400	582	0.539156627047	0.191030516478	0.169825289358	0.146003361572	2.04440912321	2.92925136006	1.4218286024	NULL	-0.605078241323	2.99443202237

The organizers are putting the finishing touches on the year's premier computational biology conference, with an expected attendance of 1400 computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, biologists and scientists from other disciplines related to and reliant on this multi-disciplinary science. ISMB/ECCB 2009 (http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/) follows the framework introduced at the ISMB/ECCB 2007 (http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/) in Vienna, and further refined at the ISMB 2008 (http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/) in Toronto; a framework developed to specifically encourage increased participation from often under-represented disciplines at conferences on computational biology. During the main ISMB conference dates of 29 June to 2 July, keynote talks from highly regarded scientists, including ISCB Award winners, are the featured presentations that bring all attendees together twice a day. The remainder of each day offers a carefully balanced selection of parallel sessions to choose from: proceedings papers, special sessions on emerging topics, highlights of the past year's published research, special interest group meetings, technology demonstrations, workshops and several unique sessions of value to the broad audience of students, faculty and industry researchers. Several hundred posters displayed for the duration of the conference has become a standard of the ISMB and ECCB conference series, and an extensive commercial exhibition showcases the latest bioinformatics publications, software, hardware and services available on the market today. The main conference is preceded by 2 days of Special Interest Group (SIG) and Satellite meetings running in parallel to the fifth Student Council Symposium on 27 June, and in parallel to Tutorials on 28 June. All scientific sessions take place at the Stockholmsmässan/Stockholm International Fairs conference and exposition facility.Contact:bj@iscb.org	0.0	4	1047	1859	2244	65	770	0.33295228987	0.232004475135	0.0999757273874	0.0682609390149	-0.967006896792	-3.48987602289	-0.990881556541	NULL	-2.82254695797	1.47016261911

Remarkably, one-third of the protein sequences in the database showed presence of either mono- or hetero-repeats, or both concomitantly—hence reiterating the importance of repeats in parasite virulence mechanisms. A number of useful bioinformatics tools including BLAST and tools for phylogenetic analysis are integrated with the database. With the rapidly burgeoning interest in the pathogenesis mechanisms of protozoans and ongoing genome sequencing projects, we anticipate that the database will be a useful tool for the research community.Availability:http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/protvirdbContact:dinesh@icgeb.res.inSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline	0.0	4	1048	338	2359	1323	1045	0.155687164817	0.142608584762	0.114450151226	0.109894442135	-0.0239491493719	-3.0464913663	-2.13919037075	NULL	2.13252827885	0.654918895881

Previously, we demonstrated that the consideration of protein–protein interactions significantly increases the accuracy of fold assignment compared with PSI-BLAST sequence comparisons. A drawback of our method was the low number of proteins to which a fold could be assigned. Here, we present an improved version of the method that addresses this limitation. We also compare our method to other state-of-the-art fold assignment methodologies.Results:Our approach (ModLink+) has been tested on 3716 proteins with domain folds classified in the Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP) as well as known interacting partners in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). For this test set, the ratio of success [positive predictive value (PPV)] on fold assignment increases from 75% for PSI-BLAST, 83% for HHSearch and 81% for PRC to >90% for ModLink+at thee-value cutoff of 10−3.

Global false discovery rate (gFDR) analysis statistically controls this error, computing the ratio of the number of false positives over the total number of rejections. Local FDR (lFDR) method can associate the corrected significance measure with each hypothesis testing for its feature-by-feature interpretation. Given the large feature number and sample size in any genomics or proteomics analysis, FDR computation, albeit critical, is both beyond the regular biologists' specialty and computationally expensive, easily exceeding the capacity of desktop computers. To overcome this digital divide, a web portal has been developed that provides bench-side biologists easy access to the server-side computing capabilities to analyze for FDR, differential expressed genes or proteins, and for the correlation between molecular data and clinical measurements.Availability:http://translationalmedicine.stanford.edu/Mass-Conductor/FDR.htmlContacts:xuefeng_ling@yahoo.com;jschill@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1056	1815	121	2277	1005	0.174994155904	0.156695420488	0.123854693123	0.121194731354	-0.233876796625	3.27998236413	-1.45890087547	NULL	0.48858434707	1.32798301984

1146	http://pseudoviewer.inha.ac.kr	1147	NULL	PseudoViewer3	Motivation:Pseudoknots in RNA structures make visualization of RNA structures difficult. Even if a pseudoknot itself is represented without a crossing, visualization of the entire RNA structure with a pseudoknot often results in a drawing with crossings between the pseudoknot and other structural elements, and requires additional intervention by the user to ensure that the structure graph is overlap-free. Many programs such as web services prefer to obtain an overlap-free graph in one-shot rather than get a graph with overlaps to be edited. There are few programs for visualizing RNA pseudoknots, and PseudoViewer has been the almost only program that automatically draws RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. The previous version of PseudoViewer visualizes all the known types of RNA pseudoknots as planar drawings, but visualizes some hypothetical pseudoknots as non-planar drawings.Results:We developed a new version of PseudoViewer for efficiently visualizing large RNA structures with any types of pseudoknots, both known and hypothetical, as planar drawings in one-shot. It is about 10 times faster than the previous algorithm, and produces a more compact and aesthetic structure drawing.

1150	http://www.mcisb.org/resources/kipar/	1151	NULL	KiPar	Motivation:Most experimental evidence on kinetic parameters is buried in the literature, whose manual searching is complex, time consuming and partial. These shortcomings become particularly acute in systems biology, where these parameters need to be integrated into detailed, genome-scale, metabolic models. These problems are addressed by KiPar, a dedicated information retrieval system designed to facilitate access to the literature relevant for kinetic modelling of a given metabolic pathway in yeast. Searching for kinetic data in the context of an individual pathway offers modularity as a way of tackling the complexity of developing a full metabolic model. It is also suitable for large-scale mining, since multiple reactions and their kinetic parameters can be specified in a single search request, rather than one reaction at a time, which is unsuitable given the size of genome-scale models.Results:We developed an integrative approach, combining public data and software resources for the rapid development of large-scale text mining tools targeting complex biological information. The user supplies input in the form of identifiers used in relevant data resources to refer to the concepts of interest, e.g. EC numbers, GO and SBO identifiers. By doing so, the user is freed from providing any other knowledge or terminology concerned with these concepts and their relations, since they are retrieved from these and cross-referenced resources automatically. The terminology acquired is used to index the literature by mapping concepts to their synonyms, and then to textual documents mentioning them. The indexing results and the previously acquired knowledge about relations between concepts are used to formulate complex search queries aiming at documents relevant to the user's information needs. The conceptual approach is demonstrated in the implementation of KiPar. Evaluation reveals that KiPar performs better than a Boolean search. The precision achieved for abstracts (60%) and full-text articles (48%) is considerably better than the baseline precision (44% and 24%, respectively). The baseline recall is improved by 36% for abstracts and by 100% for full text. It appears that full-text articles are a much richer source of information on kinetic data than are their abstracts. Finally, the combined results for abstracts and full text compared with the curated literature provide high values for relative recall (88%) and novelty ratio (92%), suggesting that the system is able to retrieve a high proportion of new documents.Availability:Source code and documentation are available at:http://www.mcisb.org/resources/kipar/Contact:i.spasic@manchester.ac.uk;dbk@manchester.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1063	762	1279	809	625	0.220845523355	0.21620873628	0.189371077243	0.171018988944	1.40170726498	-0.123522948032	1.10252293173	NULL	-1.45997918684	2.18527780258

CloudBurst is a new parallel read-mapping algorithm optimized for mapping next-generation sequence data to the human genome and other reference genomes, for use in a variety of biological analyses including SNP discovery, genotyping and personal genomics. It is modeled after the short read-mapping program RMAP, and reports either all alignments or the unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of mismatches or differences. This level of sensitivity could be prohibitively time consuming, but CloudBurst uses the open-source Hadoop implementation of MapReduce to parallelize execution using multiple compute nodes.Results:CloudBurst's running time scales linearly with the number of reads mapped, and with near linear speedup as the number of processors increases. In a 24-processor core configuration, CloudBurst is up to 30 times faster than RMAP executing on a single core, while computing an identical set of alignments. Using a larger remote compute cloud with 96 cores, CloudBurst improved performance by >100-fold, reducing the running time from hours to mere minutes for typical jobs involving mapping of millions of short reads to the human genome.Availability:CloudBurst is available open-source as a model for parallelizing algorithms with MapReduce athttp://cloudburst-bio.sourceforge.net/.Contact:mschatz@umiacs.umd.edu	28.0	4	1064	916	900	747	1999	0.29998673388	0.214205312066	0.197645022932	0.180765760273	1.94703482058	-2.25239920038	-2.55746654975	NULL	-0.965798956485	-2.97588405588

1155	http://dragon.bio.purdue.edu/ESG/	1156	NULL	ESG	Motivation:Importance of accurate automatic protein function prediction is ever increasing in the face of a large number of newly sequenced genomes and proteomics data that are awaiting biological interpretation. Conventional methods have focused on high sequence similarity-based annotation transfer which relies on the concept of homology. However, many cases have been reported that simple transfer of function from top hits of a homology search causes erroneous annotation. New methods are required to handle the sequence similarity in a more robust way to combine together signals from strongly and weakly similar proteins for effectively predicting function for unknown proteins with high reliability.Results:We present the extended similarity group (ESG) method, which performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with Gene Ontology terms. Each annotation is assigned with probability based on its relative similarity score with the multiple-level neighbors in the protein similarity graph. We will depict how the statistical framework of ESG improves the prediction accuracy by iteratively taking into account the neighborhood of query protein in the sequence similarity space. ESG outperforms conventional PSI-BLAST and the protein function prediction (PFP) algorithm. It is found that the iterative search is effective in capturing multiple-domains in a query protein, enabling accurately predicting several functions which originate from different domains.Availability:ESG web server is available for automated protein function prediction athttp://dragon.bio.purdue.edu/ESG/Contact:cspark@cau.ac.kr;dkihara@purdue.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	4	1068	1821	1573	592	1323	0.254095055879	0.251762813807	0.210416080188	0.207498446045	-1.54291817992	0.649274673813	1.64296355562	NULL	1.99956820209	0.982693460878

1157	http://mblab.wustl.edu/software/pairagon/	1158	NULL	Pairagon	Motivation:The most accurate way to determine the intron–exon structures in a genome is to align spliced cDNA sequences to the genome. Thus, cDNA-to-genome alignment programs are a key component of most annotation pipelines. The scoring system used to choose the best alignment is a primary determinant of alignment accuracy, while heuristics that prevent consideration of certain alignments are a primary determinant of runtime and memory usage. Both accuracy and speed are important considerations in choosing an alignment algorithm, but scoring systems have received much less attention than heuristics.Results:We present Pairagon, a pair hidden Markov model based cDNA-to-genome alignment program, as the most accurate aligner for sequences with high- and low-identity levels. We conducted a series of experiments testing alignment accuracy with varying sequence identity. We first created ‘perfect’ simulated cDNA sequences by splicing the sequences of exons in the reference genome sequences of fly and human. The complete reference genome sequences were then mutated to various degrees using a realistic mutation simulator and the perfect cDNAs were aligned to them using Pairagon and 12 other aligners. To validate these results with natural sequences, we performed cross-species alignment using orthologous transcripts from human, mouse and rat.We found that aligner accuracy is heavily dependent on sequence identity. For sequences with 100% identity, Pairagon achieved accuracy levels of >99.6%, with one quarter of the errors of any other aligner. Furthermore, for human/mouse alignments, which are only 85% identical, Pairagon achieved 87% accuracy, higher than any other aligner.Availability:Pairagon source and executables are freely available athttp://mblab.wustl.edu/software/pairagon/Contact:davidlu@wustl.edu;brent@cse.wustl.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1070	999	170	836	896	0.260577629317	0.226184079927	0.20608878909	0.189240988111	2.27490214178	-1.1178166949	-0.07519567568	NULL	0.875615992054	-1.75435607329

It has been shown that the removal of poorly aligned regions from an alignment increases the quality of subsequent analyses. Such an alignment trimming phase is complicated in large-scale phylogenetic analyses that deal with thousands of alignments. Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for large-scale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for selecting the most reliable positions in the alignment. These include the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of amino acid similarity and, if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the level of consistency across different alignments. Moreover, trimAl can automatically select the parameters to be used in each specific alignment so that the signal-to-noise ratio is optimized.Availability:trimAl has been written in C++, it is portable to all platforms. trimAl is freely available for download (http://trimal.cgenomics.org) and can be used online through the Phylemon web server (http://phylemon2.bioinfo.cipf.es/).

If available, the algorithm makes use of prior information such as known relationships (sub-pedigrees) or the age and sex of individuals. Statistical confidence is estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated for simulated data as well as an empirical dataset with known pedigree.

The identification of these target regions from comprehensive promoter array ChIP-chip data is challenging. Here, three approaches for the identification of transcription factor target genes from promoter array ChIP-chip data are presented. We compare (i) a standard log-fold-change analysis (LFC); (ii) a basic method based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM); and (iii) a new extension of the HMM approach to an HMM with scaled transition matrices (SHMM) that incorporates information about the relative orientation of adjacent gene pairs on DNA.Results:All three methods are applied to different promoter array ChIP-chip datasets of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeand the important model plantArabidopsis thalianato compare the prediction of transcription factor target genes. In the context of the yeast cell cycle, common target genes bound by the transcription factors ACE2 and SWI5, and ACE2 and FKH2 are identified and evaluated using the Saccharomyces Genome Database. RegardingA.thaliana, target genes of the seed-specific transcription factor ABI3 are predicted and evaluate based on publicly available gene expression profiles and transient assays performed in the wet laboratory experiments. The application of the novel SHMM to these two different promoter array ChIP-chip datasets leads to an improved identification of transcription factor target genes in comparison to the two standard approaches LFC and HMM.Availability:The software of LFC, HMM and SHMM, the ABI3 ChIP–chip dataset, andSupplementary Materialcan be downloaded fromhttp://dig.ipk-gatersleben.de/SHMMs/ChIPchip/ChIPchip.html.Contact:seifert@ipk-gatersleben.de	1.0	4	1082	820	1231	1984	629	0.431734530752	0.317316751334	0.272222061365	0.248565653334	-0.337350113788	3.03642047809	-0.173398711582	NULL	-0.423995157869	-0.667390441749

An important problem is the identification of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in promoter regions of potential TF target genes. It is typically approached by position weight matrix-based motif identification algorithms using Gibbs sampling, or heuristics to extend seed oligos. Such algorithms succeed in identifying single, relatively well-conserved binding sites, but tend to fail when it comes to the identification of combinations of several degenerate binding sites, as those often found incis-regulatory modules.Results:We propose a new algorithm that combines the benefits of existing motif finding with the ones of support vector machines (SVMs) to find degenerate motifs in order to improve the modeling of regulatory modules. In experiments on microarray data fromArabidopsis thaliana, we were able to show that the newly developed strategy significantly improves the recognition of TF targets.Availability:The python source code (open source-licensed under GPL), the data for the experiments and a Galaxy-based web service are available athttp://www.fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/kirmes/Contact:sebi@tuebingen.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1083	940	2028	2380	1804	0.278040041246	0.251728380341	0.220192096504	0.219926423972	0.112448455364	2.75044685392	0.507824989426	NULL	1.67108157731	-0.155279559727

PINE-SPARKY is based on the very popular SPARKY package for visualizing multidimensional NMR spectra (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). PINE-SPARKY consists of a converter (PINE2SPARKY), which takes the output from an automated PINE-NMR analysis and transforms it into SPARKY input, plus a number of SPARKY extensions. Assignments and their probabilities obtained in the PINE-NMR step are visualized as labels in SPARKY's spectrum view. Three SPARKY extensions (PINE Assigner,PINE Graph Assigner, andAssign the Best by PINE) serve to manipulate the labels that signify the assignments and their probabilities.PINE Assignerlists all possible assignments for a peak selected in the dialog box and enables the user to choose among these. A window inPINE Graph Assignershows all atoms in a selected residue along with all atoms in its adjacent residues; in addition, it displays a ranked list of PINE-derived connectivity assignments to any selected atom.Assign the Best-by-PINEallows the user to choose a probability threshold and to automatically accept as “fixed” all assignments above that threshold; following this operation, only the less certain assignments need to be examined visually. Once assignments are fixed, the output files generated by PINE-SPARKY can be used as input to PINE-NMR for further refinements.Availability:The program, in the form of source code and binary code along with tutorials and reference manuals, is available athttp://pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu/PINE-SPARKY.Contact:whlee@nmrfam.wisc.edu;markley@nmrfam.wisc.edu	4.0	4	1085	1888	2310	666	1233	0.553406173442	0.503251548744	0.245642427857	0.15678879315	0.616354684673	1.73976912996	3.56841373445	NULL	3.23976311935	-0.45530726408

1188	http://www.adni-info.org	1189	NULL	ADNI	Motivation:Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and brain imaging techniques enable new approaches to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structures and functions. Traditional association studies typically employ independent and pairwise univariate analysis, which treats single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) as isolated units and ignores important underlying interacting relationships between the units. New methods are proposed here to overcome this limitation.Results:Taking into account the interlinked structure within and between SNPs and imaging QTs, we propose a novel Group-Sparse Multi-task Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method to identify quantitative trait loci for multiple disease-relevant QTs and apply it to a study in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Built upon regression analysis, our model uses a new form of regularization,groupℓ2,1-norm(G2,1-norm), to incorporate the biological group structures among SNPs induced from their genetic arrangement. The newG2,1-normconsiders the regression coefficients of all the SNPs in each group with respect to all the QTs together and enforces sparsity at the group level. In addition, an ℓ2,1-norm regularization is utilized to couple feature selection across multiple tasks to make use of the shared underlying mechanism among different brain regions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected SNP predictors relevant to the imaging QTs.Availability:Software is publicly available at:http://ranger.uta.edu/%7eheng/imaging-genetics/Contact:heng@uta.edu;shenli@iupui.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	1100	1697	1036	898	1011	0.177136169996	0.169798821036	0.16123422675	0.16047234782	-1.60142530884	1.58854924868	-2.67640349771	NULL	1.14290449594	1.63282428664

Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA.Results:PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation >23) was ≥0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.Availability:The PSICOV source code can be downloaded fromhttp://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOVContact:d.jones@cs.ucl.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	27.0	5	1102	1882	1803	379	1067	0.297787136338	0.281741402298	0.213539361952	0.182865497935	-1.72480248309	0.736194670277	3.29581398769	NULL	2.32964805032	-1.38824454707

However, existing methods for identifying differentially expressed genes or sets of genes by comparing measures of the average expression across predefined sample groups do not detect differential variance in the expression levels across genes in cellular pathways. Since corresponding pathway deregulations occur frequently in microarray gene or protein expression data, we present a new dedicated web application, PathVar, to analyze these data sources. The software ranks pathway-representing gene/protein sets in terms of the differences of the variance in the within-pathway expression levels across different biological conditions.

A number of algorithms have been developed to infer genotypes from data generated through the Illumina BeadStation platform, including GenCall, GenoSNP, Illuminus and CRLMM. Most of these algorithms are built on population-based statistical models to genotype every SNP in turn, such as GenCall with the GenTrain clustering algorithm, and require a large reference population to perform well. These approaches may not work well for rare variants where only a small proportion of the individuals carry the variant. A fundamentally different approach, implemented in GenoSNP, adopts a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based model to infer genotypes of all the SNPs in one individual, making it an appealing alternative to call rare variants. However, compared to the population-based strategies, more SNPs in GenoSNP may fail the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium test. To take advantage of both strategies, we propose a two-stage SNP calling procedure, named the modified mixture model (M3), to improve call accuracy for both common and rare variants. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through applications to genotype calling on a set of HapMap samples used for quality control purpose in a large case–control study of cocaine dependence. The increase in power with M3is greater for rare variants than for common variants depending on the model.Availability:M3algorithm:http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/group.Contact:name@bio.com;hongyu.zhao@yale.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1112	499	2126	2406	575	0.370146329259	0.320363286688	0.300151752153	0.296366448089	0.334848397107	0.716334191195	-2.91174223805	NULL	-0.0127488689726	0.631779415345

Starting with a set of regulatory elements known to be active in a particular tissue/process, it learns the sequence code of the input set and builds a predictive model from features specific to those elements. The resulting model can then be applied to user-supplied genomic regions to identify novel candidate regulatory elements. CLARE's model also provides a detailed analysis of transcription factors that most likely bind to the elements, making it an invaluable tool for understanding mechanisms of tissue-specific gene regulation.Availability:CLARE is freely accessible athttp://clare.dcode.org/.Contact:taherl@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov;ovcharen@nih.govSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1119	1005	888	2011	293	0.270751891307	0.248747892049	0.200574578899	0.19419606283	0.583078203181	1.55652134414	0.0379782518063	NULL	0.411818883193	0.00100623253106

They play a major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination, computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are important.Results:Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of 87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands for 83% proteins in the dataset.

1210	http://protein.bio.unipd.it/espritz/	1211	NULL	ESpritz	Motivation:Intrinsically disordered regions are key for the function of numerous proteins, and the scant available experimental annotations suggest the existence of different disorder flavors. While efficient predictions are required to annotate entire genomes, most existing methods require sequence profiles for disorder prediction, making them cumbersome for high-throughput applications.Results:In this work, we present an ensemble of protein disorder predictors called ESpritz. These are based on bidirectional recursive neural networks and trained on three different flavors of disorder, including a novel NMR flexibility predictor. ESpritz can produce fast and accurate sequence-only predictions, annotating entire genomes in the order of hours on a single processor core. Alternatively, a slower but slightly more accurate ESpritz variant using sequence profiles can be used for applications requiring maximum performance. Two levels of prediction confidence allow either to maximize reasonable disorder detection or to limit expected false positives to 5%. ESpritz performs consistently well on the recent CASP9 data, reaching aSwmeasure of 54.82 and area under the receiver operator curve of 0.856. The fast predictor is four orders of magnitude faster and remains better than most publicly available CASP9 methods, making it ideal for genomic scale predictions.Conclusions:ESpritz predicts three flavors of disorder at two distinct false positive rates, either with a fast or slower and slightly more accurate approach. Given its state-of-the-art performance, it can be especially useful for high-throughput applications.Availability:Both a web server for high-throughput analysis and a Linux executable version of ESpritz are available from:http://protein.bio.unipd.it/espritz/Contact:silvio.tosatto@unipd.itSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	15.0	4	1121	521	1566	1534	909	0.369175148346	0.207514992305	0.196304248468	0.172160253509	-1.73587961535	1.73920414951	3.37282356676	NULL	3.00230764498	-0.889918314712

Moreover, it may be used for cellular phenotyping and help establishing the etiology of diseases characterized by abnormal splicing patterns. In RNA-Seq, the exact nature of splicing events is buried in the reads that span exon–exon boundaries. The accurate and efficient mapping of these reads to the reference genome is a major challenge.Results:We developed PASSion, a pattern growth algorithm-based pipeline for splice site detection in paired-end RNA-Seq reads. Comparing the performance of PASSion to three existing RNA-Seq analysis pipelines, TopHat, MapSplice and HMMSplicer, revealed that PASSion is competitive with these packages. Moreover, the performance of PASSion is not affected by read length and coverage. It performs better than the other three approaches when detecting junctions in highly abundant transcripts. PASSion has the ability to detect junctions that do not have known splicing motifs, which cannot be found by the other tools. Of the two public RNA-Seq datasets, PASSion predicted ∼ 137 000 and 173 000 splicing events, of which on average 82 are known junctions annotated in the Ensembl transcript database and 18% are novel. In addition, our package can discover differential and shared splicing patterns among multiple samples.Availability:The code and utilities can be freely downloaded fromhttps://trac.nbic.nl/passionandftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/zn1/passionContact:y.zhang@lumc.nl;k.ye@lumc.nlSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1122	1041	1232	730	1901	0.392378007628	0.382116609451	0.34311756961	0.277477162414	-2.70120486359	-1.19185104306	-2.07629104746	NULL	-1.92948043548	-2.32123600004

To resolve this problem, we created a software tool, Gencrypt, which utilizes a security protocol known as one-way cryptographic hashes to allow overlapping participants to be identified without sharing individual-level data.Availability:Gencrypt is freely available under the GNU general public license v3 athttp://www.broadinstitute.org/software/gencrypt/Contact:joelh@broadinstitute.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1136	2242	2259	729	1549	0.310510335866	0.18821761106	0.162494413682	0.147099009956	-0.418533414074	1.33469495577	-2.63497128474	NULL	0.592314318636	1.77311217637

Our understanding of gene regulation would be greatly improved if we could measure RNA synthesis and decay rates on a genome-wide level. To that end, the Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA) method has been developed. DTA combines metabolic RNA labeling with standard transcriptomics to measure RNA synthesis and decay rates in a precise and non-perturbing manner. Here, we present the open sourceR/Bioconductorsoftware packageDTA. It implements all required bioinformatics steps that allow the accurate absolute quantification and comparison of RNA turnover.Availability:DTAis part ofR/Bioconductor.

We adapted the compressed full-text index (BWT) used by SOAP2 in view of the advantages and disadvantages of GPU. When tested with millions of Illumina Hiseq 2000 length-100 bp reads, SOAP3 takes < 30 s to align a million read pairs onto the human reference genome and is at least 7.5 and 20 times faster than BWA and Bowtie, respectively. For aligning reads with up to four mismatches, SOAP3 aligns slightly more reads than BWA and Bowtie; this is because SOAP3, unlike BWA and Bowtie, is not heuristic-based and always reports all answers.Availability:SOAP3 is available at:http://www.cs.hku.hk/2bwt-tools/soap3;http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soap3.html.Contact:liruiqiang@gmail.com,twlam@cs.hku.hk	15.0	4	1138	441	1078	516	1027	0.554531407136	0.476172649521	0.254831045556	0.16324780044	1.9308862063	-1.99836107713	-2.11328186368	NULL	-0.687780908339	-3.01772926327

It acts as an integration layer between analysis applications and BAM files that are processed using Hadoop. Hadoop-BAM solves the issues related to BAM data access by presenting a convenient API for implementing map and reduce functions that can directly operate on BAM records. It builds on top of the Picard SAM JDK, so tools that rely on the Picard API are expected to be easily convertible to support large-scale distributed processing. In this article we demonstrate the use of Hadoop-BAM by building a coverage summarizing tool for the Chipster genome browser. Our results show that Hadoop offers good scalability, and one should avoid moving data in and out of Hadoop between analysis steps.Availability:Available under the open-source MIT license athttp://sourceforge.net/projects/hadoop-bam/Contact:matti.niemenmaa@aalto.fiSupplementary information:Supplementary materialis available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	4	1139	1542	1616	1845	1212	0.352476587403	0.256686616275	0.251365239872	0.167928373322	1.45791495675	-2.93934189904	-1.32160284769	NULL	-2.42280701752	-1.20854022101
1230	http://www.somnathdatta.org/Supp/SVPLS/	1231	NULL	SVA-PLS	Motivation:In a typical gene expression profiling study, our prime objective is to identify the genes that are differentially expressed between the samples from two different tissue types. Commonly, standard analysis of variance (ANOVA)/regression is implemented to identify the relative effects of these genes over the two types of samples from their respective arrays of expression levels. But, this technique becomes fundamentally flawed when there are unaccounted sources of variability in these arrays (latent variables attributable to different biological, environmental or other factors relevant in the context). These factors distort the true picture of differential gene expression between the two tissue types and introduce spurious signals of expression heterogeneity. As a result, many genes which are actually differentially expressed are not detected, whereas many others are falsely identified as positives. Moreover, these distortions can be different for different genes. Thus, it is also not possible to get rid of these variations by simple array normalizations. This both-way error can lead to a serious loss in sensitivity and specificity, thereby causing a severe inefficiency in the underlying multiple testing problem. In this work, we attempt to identify the hidden effects of the underlying latent factors in a gene expression profiling study by partial least squares (PLS) and apply ANCOVA technique with the PLS-identified signatures of these hidden effects as covariates, in order to identify the genes that are truly differentially expressed between the two concerned tissue types.Results:We compare the performance of our method SVA-PLS with standard ANOVA and a relatively recent technique of surrogate variable analysis (SVA), on a wide variety of simulation settings (incorporating different effects of the hidden variable, under situations with varying signal intensities and gene groupings). In all settings, our method yields the highest sensitivity while maintaining relatively reasonable values for the specificity, false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Application of our method to gene expression profiling for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia shows that our method detects an additional six genes, that are missed by both the standard ANOVA method as well as SVA, but may be relevant to this disease, as can be seen from mining the existing literature.Availability:The R code for our method, SVA-PLS, is freely available on the Supplementary websitehttp://www.somnathdatta.org/Supp/SVPLS/Contact:s0chak10@louisville.edu;susmita.datta@louisville.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	1140	888	1939	1104	690	0.210604779277	0.206582030059	0.20217114664	0.200827529456	-1.16881954598	0.089074564101	-1.12255041387	NULL	-1.90905797765	0.356989258661

Despite the extraordinary published efforts during the past centuries of scientists performing amputations, transplantations and molecular experiments, no mechanistic model exists yet that can completely explain patterning during the limb regeneration process. The lack of a centralized repository to enable the efficient mining of this huge dataset is hindering the discovery of comprehensive models of limb regeneration. Here, we introduce Limbform (Limb formalization), a centralized database of published limb regeneration experiments. In contrast to natural language or text-based ontologies, Limbform is based on a functional ontology using mathematical graphs to represent unambiguously limb phenotypes and manipulation procedures. The centralized database currently contains >800 published limb regeneration experiments comprising many model organisms, including salamanders, frogs, insects, crustaceans and arachnids. The database represents an extraordinary resource for mining the existing knowledge of functional data in this field; furthermore, its mathematical nature based on a functional ontology will pave the way for artificial intelligence tools applied to the discovery of the sought-after comprehensive limb regeneration models.Availability and implementaion:The Limbform database is freely available athttp://limbform.daniel-lobo.com.Contact:michael.levin@tufts.edu	1.0	4	1156	2346	640	1328	923	0.2991624554	0.0978026915422	0.0963951709426	0.0863723234888	2.95387736523	-1.8152744508	2.10804454635	NULL	-2.55600383768	1.77299303342

Because of the importance ofin vivoassessment of gene function and modeling of human diseases, this technique has been widely adopted to generate a large number of mutant mouse models. Due to the recent breakthroughs in high-throughput sequencing technologies, RNA-Seq experiments have been performed on many of these mouse models, leading to hundreds of publicly available datasets. To facilitate the reuse of these datasets, we collected the associated metadata and organized them in a database called RNASeqMetaDB. The metadata were manually curated to ensure annotation consistency. We developed a web server to allow easy database navigation and data querying.

Several loci in plant genomes produce clusters of 24-nt RNAs, and these loci are receiving increasing attention from the research community. However, at present there is no bioinformatics resource dedicated to 24-nt siRNA loci and their derived 24-nt siRNAs. Thus, in this study, Pln24NT, a freely available web resource, was created to centralize 24-nt siRNA loci and 24-nt siRNA information, including fundamental locus information, expression profiles and annotation of transposon elements, from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for 10 popular plant species. An intuitive web interface was also developed for convenient searching and browsing, and analytical tools were included to help users flexibly analyze their own siRNA NGS data. Pln24NT will help the plant research community to discover and characterize 24-nt siRNAs, and may prove useful for studying the roles of siRNA in RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants.Availability and Implementation:http://bioinformatics.caf.ac.cn/Pln24NT.Contact:suxh@caf.ac.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	0.0	6	1159	659	2190	855	2284	0.167392693894	0.15332933972	0.135039835847	0.132031560884	-3.0972772534	-1.84759686858	0.123594235128	NULL	-1.71497502411	-2.21558565101

Such experiments produce huge amounts of image data and thus require automated analysis. However, automated detection of cell outlines (cell segmentation) is typically challenging due to, e.g. high cell densities, cell-to-cell variability and low signal-to-noise ratios.Results:Here, we evaluate accuracy and speed of various state-of-the-art approaches for cell segmentation in light microscopy images using challenging real and synthetic image data. The results vary between datasets and show that the tested tools are either not robust enough or computationally expensive, thus limiting their application to large-scale experiments. We therefore developed fastER, a trainable tool that is orders of magnitude faster while producing state-of-the-art segmentation quality. It supports various cell types and image acquisition modalities, but is easy-to-use even for non-experts: it has no parameters and can be adapted to specific image sets by interactively labelling cells for training. As a proof of concept, we segment and count cells in over 200 000 brightfield images (1388 × 1040 pixels each) from a six day time-lapse microscopy experiment; identification of over 46 000 000 single cells requires only about two and a half hours on a desktop computer.Availability and Implementation:C ++ code, binaries and data athttps://www.bsse.ethz.ch/csd/software/faster.html.Contact:oliver.hilsenbeck@bsse.ethz.chortimm.schroeder@bsse.ethz.chSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	9	1168	1585	2044	1990	1653	0.318788836611	0.310405066328	0.279894821844	0.260089450788	-1.75164544873	0.4245712556	-0.380853789694	NULL	-0.117270496403	-1.7571708769

Instead of requiring each measurement to be classified as active or inactive, RefBool allows for the classification of a third state that can be interpreted as an intermediate expression of genes. Furthermore, each measurement is associated to a p- and q-value indicating the significance of each classification.

There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing.Results:We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than the competing approaches.Availability and Implementation:The methods are implemented in R package FUNNEL, freely and publicly available at:https://github.com/yunzhang813/FUNNEL-GSEA-R-Package.Contact:xing_qiu@urmc.rochester.eduorjuilee_thakar@urmc.rochester.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	11	1170	188	137	555	1830	0.222953529044	0.22121022239	0.201698512428	0.193902181615	-0.378463615032	0.170753281565	-1.21630912015	NULL	-1.00179182066	2.06178029871

1273	https://simtk.org/projects/stams	1274	NULL	STAMS	Motivation:Analyzing genome wide association data in the context of biological pathways helps us understand how genetic variation influences phenotype and increases power to find associations. However, the utility of pathway-based analysis tools is hampered by undercuration and reliance on a distribution of signal across all of the genes in a pathway. Methods that combine genome wide association results with genetic networks to infer the key phenotype-modulating subnetworks combat these issues, but have primarily been limited to network definitions with yes/no labels for gene-gene interactions. A recent method (EW_dmGWAS) incorporates a biological network with weighted edge probability by requiring a secondary phenotype-specific expression dataset. In this article, we combine an algorithm for weighted-edge module searching and a probabilistic interaction network in order to develop a method, STAMS, for recovering modules of genes with strong associations to the phenotype and probable biologic coherence. Our method builds on EW_dmGWAS but does not require a secondary expression dataset and performs better in six test cases.Results:We show that our algorithm improves over EW_dmGWAS and standard gene-based analysis by measuring precision and recall of each method on separately identified associations. In the Wellcome Trust Rheumatoid Arthritis study, STAMS-identified modules were more enriched for separately identified associations than EW_dmGWAS (STAMSP-value 3.0 × 10−4; EW_dmGWAS-P-value = 0.8). We demonstrate that the area under the Precision-Recall curve is 5.9 times higher with STAMS than EW_dmGWAS run on the Wellcome Trust Type 1 Diabetes data.Availability and Implementation:STAMS is implemented as an R package and is freely available athttps://simtk.org/projects/stams.Contact:rbaltman@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	6	1183	2115	137	1548	555	0.164567528198	0.15916224471	0.154754392381	0.14484142341	-0.618403617103	0.755596761787	-1.84929349282	NULL	0.24679438502	2.21373516143

Rigid-body docking by Zdock showed that for 1208 cases (85.2%), at least one correct decoy was generated, emphasizing the efficiency of rigid-body docking in generating correct assemblies.

Unfortunately, not all markers obtained from these strategies provide enough information for solving multiple evolutionary questions at a reasonable taxonomic resolution.Results:We have developed Development Of Molecular markers In Non-model Organisms (DOMINO), a bioinformatics tool for informative marker development from both next generation sequencing (NGS) data and pre-computed sequence alignments. The application implements popular NGS tools with new utilities in a highly versatile pipeline specifically designed to discover or select personalized markers at different levels of taxonomic resolution. These markers can be directly used to study the taxa surveyed for their design, utilized for further downstream PCR amplification in a broader set taxonomic scope, or exploited as suitable templates to bait design for target DNA enrichment techniques.

1276	https://github.com/MinzhuXie/H-PoPG	1277	NULL	H-PoP and H-PoPG	Motivation:Some economically important plants including wheat and cotton have more than two copies of each chromosome. With the decreasing cost and increasing read length of next-generation sequencing technologies, reconstructing the multiple haplotypes of a polyploid genome from its sequence reads becomes practical. However, the computational challenge in polyploid haplotyping is much greater than that in diploid haplotyping, and there are few related methods.Results:This article models the polyploid haplotyping problem as an optimal poly-partition problem of the reads, called the Polyploid Balanced Optimal Partition model. For the reads sequenced from ak-ploid genome, the model tries to divide the reads intokgroups such that the difference between the reads of the same group is minimized while the difference between the reads of different groups is maximized. When the genotype information is available, the model is extended to the Polyploid Balanced Optimal Partition with Genotype constraint problem. These models are all NP-hard. We propose two heuristic algorithms, H-PoP and H-PoPG, based on dynamic programming and a strategy of limiting the number of intermediate solutions at each iteration, to solve the two models, respectively. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms can solve the models effectively, and are much faster and more accurate than the recent state-of-the-art polyploid haplotyping algorithms. The experiments also show that our algorithms can deal with long reads and deep read coverage effectively and accurately. Furthermore, H-PoP might be applied to help determine the ploidy of an organism.Availability and Implementation:https://github.com/MinzhuXie/H-PoPGContact:xieminzhu@hotmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	7	1186	747	1038	1833	1440	0.225403245792	0.2114494387	0.209990079472	0.177788622524	2.24381463828	-1.42302512846	-2.7554821664	NULL	-0.689380355312	-2.94002993592

The aim of this study was the development of a novel software tool that, given a protein’s structural model, predicts the presence and identity of active sites and/or ligand binding sites.Results:The algorithm implemented by ligand binding site recognition application (LIBRA) is based on a graph theory approach to find the largest subset of similar residues between an input protein and a collection of known functional sites. The algorithm makes use of two predefined databases for active sites and ligand binding sites, respectively, derived from the Catalytic Site Atlas and the Protein Data Bank. Tests indicate that LIBRA is able to identify the correct binding/active site in 90% of the cases analyzed, 90% of which feature the identified site as ranking first. As far as ligand binding site recognition is concerned, LIBRA outperforms other structure-based ligand binding sites detection tools with which it has been compared.Availability and implementation:The application, developed in Java SE 7 with a Swing GUI embedding a JMol applet, can be run on any OS equipped with a suitable Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and is available at the following URL:http://www.computationalbiology.it/software/LIBRAv1.zip.Contact:polticel@uniroma3.itSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1192	2413	1372	1091	653	0.431041116367	0.324062844923	0.319945495024	0.310658788197	-0.83085354798	2.63705865126	1.60307187205	NULL	2.35736886427	0.0117472498833

Separate views of the two alleles are then displayed in a scrollable web browser view, enabling a more intuitive visualization of each allele, compared with the single reference genome-based view common to most current read browsers.

The simplest variation of this problem is the differential peak calling (DPC) problem. Here, one has to find genomic regions with ChIP-seq signal changes between two cellular conditions in the interaction of a protein with DNA. The great majority of peak calling methods can only analyze one ChIP-seq signal at a time and are unable to perform DPC. Recently, a few approaches based on the combination of these peak callers with statistical tests for detecting differential digital expression have been proposed. However, these methods fail to detect detailed changes of protein–DNA interactions.Results:We propose an One-stage DIffereNtial peak caller (ODIN); an Hidden Markov Model-based approach to detect and analyze differential peaks (DPs) in pairs of ChIP-seq data. ODIN performs genomic signal processing, peak calling andp-valuecalculation in an integrated framework. We also propose an evaluation methodology to compare ODIN with competing methods. The evaluation method is based on the association of DPs with expression changes in the same cellular conditions. Our empirical study based on several ChIP-seq experiments from transcription factors, histone modifications and simulated data shows that ODIN outperforms considered competing methods in most scenarios.Availability and implementation:http://costalab.org/wp/odin.Contact:ivan.costa@rwth-aachen.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1207	2317	1984	2163	2370	0.294734701972	0.273064477069	0.253016139579	0.230917948129	-0.45584340278	3.17920742529	-0.300487703963	NULL	-0.730546921547	-0.737049892185

Quality control (QC) is a critical step in the analysis pipeline to ensure that BS-seq data are of high quality and suitable for subsequent analysis. Although several QC tools are available for next-generation sequencing data, most of them were not designed to handle QC issues specific to BS-seq protocols. Therefore, there is a strong need for a dedicated QC tool to evaluate and remove potential technical biases in BS-seq experiments.Results:We developed a package named BSeQC to comprehensively evaluate the quality of BS-seq experiments and automatically trim nucleotides with potential technical biases that may result in inaccurate methylation estimation. BSeQC takes standard SAM/BAM files as input and generates bias-free SAM/BAM files for downstream analysis. Evaluation based on real BS-seq data indicates that the use of the bias-free SAM/BAM file substantially improves the quantification of methylation level.Availability and implementation:BSeQC is freely available at:http://code.google.com/p/bseqc/.Contact:wl1@bcm.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1212	535	1560	585	1523	0.456324048322	0.266801413555	0.242959385923	0.202043260322	-2.05610287218	-0.961392561257	-2.2773140845	NULL	-1.91969897723	-1.94194446895

Standard methods are needed to transform such data into a more useful and intuitive format. We present ReportingTools, a Bioconductor package, that automatically recognizes and transforms the output of many common Bioconductor packages into rich, interactive, HTML-based reports. Reports are not generic, but have been individually designed to reflect content specific to the result type detected. Tabular output included in reports is sortable, filterable and searchable and contains context-relevant hyperlinks to external databases. Additionally, in-line graphics have been developed for specific analysis types and are embedded by default within table rows, providing a useful visual summary of underlying raw data. ReportingTools is highly flexible and reports can be easily customized for specific applications using the well-defined API.Availability: The ReportingTools package is implemented inRand available from Bioconductor (version ≥ 2.11) at the URL:http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html.

Unlike α-helices that are locally stabilized, β-sheets result from pairwise hydrogen bonding of two or more disjoint regions of the protein backbone. The problem of predicting contacts among β-strands in proteins has been addressed by several supervised computational approaches. Recently, prediction of residue contacts based on correlated mutations has been greatly improved and finally allows the prediction of 3D structures of the proteins.Results:In this article, we describe BCov, which is the first unsupervised method to predict the β-sheet topology starting from the protein sequence and its secondary structure. BCov takes advantage of the sparse inverse covariance estimation to define β-strand partner scores. Then an optimization based on integer programming is carried out to predict the β-sheet connectivity. When tested on the prediction of β-strand pairing, BCov scores with average values of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1 equal to 0.56 and 0.61, respectively, on a non-redundant dataset of 916 protein chains known with atomic resolution.

Lep-MAP is fast and memory efficient and largely automated, requiring minimal user interaction. It uses simultaneously data on multiple outbred families and can increase linkage map accuracy by taking into account achiasmatic meiosis, a special feature of Lepidoptera and some other taxa with no recombination in one sex (no recombination in females in Lepidoptera). We demonstrate that Lep-MAP outperforms other methods on real and simulated data. We construct a genome-wide linkage map of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) with over 40 000 SNPs.

Thus, FTFlex is an extension of our FTMap server, which only considers rigid structures. FTFlex identifies flexible residues within the binding site and determines alternative conformations using a rotamer library. In cases where the mapping results of the apo structure were in poor agreement with those of the bound structure, FTFlex was able to yield a modified apo structure, which lead to improved FTMap results.

Pyrosequencing of protein-coding genes, which can help elucidate functional differences among microbial communities, significantly lags behind 16S rDNA in availability of sequence analysis software. In both settings, frequent homopolymer read errors inflate the estimation of microbial diversity, and de-noising is required to reduce that bias. Here we describe FunFrame, an R-based data-analysis pipeline that uses recently described algorithms to de-noise functional gene pyrosequences and performs ecological analysis on de-noised sequence data. The novelty of this pipeline is that it provides users a unified set of tools, adapted from disparate sources and designed for different applications, that can be used to examine a particular protein coding gene of interest. We evaluated FunFrame on functional genes from four PCR-amplified clones with sequence depths ranging from 9084 to 14494 sequences. FunFrame produced from one to nine Operational Taxanomic Units for each clone, resulting in an error rate ranging from 0 to 0.18%. Importantly, FunFrame reduced spurious diversity while retaining more sequences than a commonly used de-noising method that discards sequences with frameshift errors.Availability:Software, documentation and a complete set of sample data files are available athttp://faculty.www.umb.edu/jennifer.bowen/software/FunFrame.zip.Contact:Jennifer.Bowen@umb.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1227	2194	2176	1106	2410	0.153588779228	0.129877066529	0.129002129769	0.127131932123	0.211555472204	-0.92396579969	-2.04231268579	NULL	-0.707975802601	-0.0378746032296

Moreover, most laboratories are unable to easily obtain ChIPx data for one or more TF(s) in more than a handful of biological contexts. Thus, standard ChIPx analyses primarily focus on analyzing data from one experiment, and the discoveries are restricted to a specific biological context.Results:We propose to enrich this existing data analysis paradigm by developing a novel approach, ChIP-PED, which superimposes ChIPx data on large amounts of publicly available human and mouse gene expression data containing a diverse collection of cell types, tissues and disease conditions to discover new biological contexts with potential TF regulatory activities. We demonstrate ChIP-PED using a number of examples, including a novel discovery thatMYC, a human TF, plays an important functional role in pediatric Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These examples show that ChIP-PED increases the value of ChIPx data by allowing one to expand the scope of possible discoveries made from a ChIPx experiment.Availability:http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/∼gewu/ChIPPED/Contact:hji@jhsph.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1231	1082	629	820	1829	0.317316751334	0.316326883189	0.298841032056	0.26979882084	-0.324409538465	3.08033505904	-0.138410388103	NULL	-0.344739422433	-0.792729172609

Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.Results:We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementaryin silicoanalyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon–exon junctions.Availability:SplicingCompass is licensed under the GNU GPL and freely available as a package in the statistical language R athttp://www.ichip.de/software/SplicingCompass.htmlContact:m.aschoff@dkfz.deorr.koenig@dkfz.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	5	1232	1901	1122	1778	1926	0.399534974848	0.382116609451	0.332090102393	0.324103776445	-2.86252941264	-1.07844623484	-2.19554616932	NULL	-2.05287165771	-2.03395824513

1330	http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/epsilon	1331	NULL	EPSILON	Motivation:When genomic data are associated with gene expression data, the resulting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) will likely span multiple genes. eQTL prioritization techniques can be used to select the most likely causal gene affecting the expression of a target gene from a list of candidates. As an input, these techniques use physical interaction networks that often contain highly connected genes and unreliable or irrelevant interactions that can interfere with the prioritization process. We present EPSILON, an extendable framework for eQTL prioritization, which mitigates the effect of highly connected genes and unreliable interactions by constructing a local network before a network-based similarity measure is applied to select the true causal gene.Results:We tested the new method on three eQTL datasets derived from yeast data using three different association techniques. A physical interaction network was constructed, and each eQTL in each dataset was prioritized using the EPSILON approach: first, a local network was constructed using ak-trials shortest path algorithm, followed by the calculation of a network-based similarity measure. Three similarity measures were evaluated: random walks, the Laplacian Exponential Diffusion kernel and the Regularized Commute-Time kernel. The aim was to predict knockout interactions from a yeast knockout compendium. EPSILON outperformed two reference prioritization methods, random assignment and shortest path prioritization. Next, we found that using a local network significantly increased prioritization performance in terms of predicted knockout pairs when compared with using exactly the same network similarity measures on the global network, with an average increase in prioritization performance of 8 percentage points (P< 10−5).Availability:The physical interaction network and the source code (Matlab/C++) of our implementation can be downloaded fromhttp://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/epsilon.Contact:lieven.verbeke@intec.ugent.be,kamar@psb.ugent.be,jan.fostier@intec.ugent.beSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1240	1244	163	2115	1902	0.261981490114	0.259406016012	0.244336228851	0.229189340729	1.04124619919	0.390677430624	1.27770681471	NULL	0.153109427841	2.32041970105

Owing to the complexity and often incomplete representation of transcripts in sequencing libraries, the assembly of high-quality transcriptomes can be challenging. However, with the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve RNA-Seq assemblies by guiding them with genomic sequences.Results:This study introduces BRANCH, an algorithm designed for improvingde novotranscriptome assemblies by using genomic information that can be partial or complete genome sequences from the same or a related organism. Its input includes assembled RNA reads (transfrags), genomic sequences (e.g. contigs) and the RNA reads themselves. It uses a customized version of BLAT to align the transfrags and RNA reads to the genomic sequences. After identifying exons from the alignments, it defines a directed acyclic graph and maps the transfrags to paths on the graph. It then joins and extends the transfrags by applying an algorithm that solves a combinatorial optimization problem, called the Minimum weight Minimum Path Cover with given Paths. In performance tests on real data fromCaenorhabditis elegansandSaccharomyces cerevisiae, assisted by genomic contigs from the same species, BRANCH improved the sensitivity and precision of transfrags generated by Velvet/Oases or Trinity by 5.1–56.7% and 0.3–10.5%, respectively. These improvements added 3.8–74.1% complete transcripts and 8.3–3.8% proteins to the initial assembly.

We developed a graphical software package based on a novel approach that can consistently identify CNVs of all types (homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, heterozygous duplications) from exome-sequencing data without the need of a paired control. The algorithm compares coverage depth in a test sample against a background distribution of control samples and uses principal component analysis to remove batch effects. It is user friendly and can be run on a personal computer.Availability and implementation:The main scripts are implemented in R (2.15), and the GUI is created using Java 1.6.

We extended the PARADIGM algorithm (Vaskeet al., 2010,Bioinformatics,26, i237–i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple ‘-omics’ data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene and protein interactions curated from the literature. Using genomic and mRNA expression data from 1936 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, we learned interactions that provided support for and relative strength of 7138 (78%) of the curated links. Gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. Within the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions associated with the MYC pathway and the ER alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal A subtypes. PARADIGM with the Naive Bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original version of PARADIGM and a version without the assumption. We found that this Naive Bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently on their shared target.Availability:http://paradigm.five3genomics.comContact:charlie@five3genomics.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1255	1704	2357	2257	1701	0.241312739859	0.231878839424	0.228858614623	0.200974601212	-2.30034410443	0.586678379104	-1.62819478915	NULL	-2.40232524271	-0.695598834206

Most prediction tools applicable to this kind of data are based on an initial multiple alignment of the peptide ligands. Building an initial alignment can be error-prone, especially in the case of the proline-rich peptides bound by the SH3 domains.Results:Here, we present a machine-learning approach based on an efficient graph-kernel technique to predict the specificity of a large set of 70 human SH3 domains, which are an important class of PRMs. The graph-kernel strategy allows us to (i) integrate several types of physico-chemical information for each amino acid, (ii) consider high-order correlations between these features and (iii) eliminate the need for an initial peptide alignment. We build specialized models for each human SH3 domain and achieve competitive predictive performance of 0.73 area under precision-recall curve, compared with 0.27 area under precision-recall curve for state-of-the-art methods based on position weight matrices.We show that better models can be obtained when we use information on the noninteracting peptides (negative examples), which is currently not used by the state-of-the art approaches based on position weight matrices. To this end, we analyze two strategies to identify subsets of high confidence negative data.The techniques introduced here are more general and hence can also be used for any other protein domains, which interact with short peptides (i.e. other PRMs).Availability:The program with the predictive models can be found athttp://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/SH3PepInt/SH3PepInt.tar.gz.

1347	http://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba_tran	1348	NULL	IDBA-tran	Motivation:RNA sequencing based on next-generation sequencing technology is effective for analyzing transcriptomes. Like de novo genome assembly, de novo transcriptome assembly does not rely on any reference genome or additional annotation information, but is more difficult. In particular, isoforms can have very uneven expression levels (e.g. 1:100), which make it very difficult to identify low-expressed isoforms. One challenge is to remove erroneous vertices/edges with high multiplicity (produced by high-expressed isoforms) in the de Bruijn graph without removing correct ones with not-so-high multiplicity from low-expressed isoforms. Failing to do so will result in the loss of low-expressed isoforms or having complicated subgraphs with transcripts of different genes mixed together due to erroneous vertices/edges.Contributions:Unlike existing tools, which remove erroneous vertices/edges with multiplicities lower than a global threshold, we use a probabilistic progressive approach to iteratively remove them with local thresholds. This enables us to decompose the graph into disconnected components, each containing a few genes, if not a single gene, while retaining many correct vertices/edges of low-expressed isoforms. Combined with existing techniques, IDBA-Tran is able to assemble both high-expressed and low-expressed transcripts and outperform existing assemblers in terms of sensitivity and specificity for both simulated and real data.Availability:http://www.cs.hku.hk/∼alse/idba_tran.Contact:chin@cs.hku.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	6.0	4	1257	488	2350	627	1305	0.25538658338	0.243169282759	0.206698553809	0.1910685382	0.037297893636	-1.27498485745	-2.76650813171	NULL	-0.995761191544	-2.37999987035

Various analysis tools have been developed to align and assemble RNA-seq data, such as the widely used TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline. A common observation is that a sizable fraction of the fragments/reads align to multiple locations of the genome. These multiple alignments pose substantial challenges to existing RNA-seq analysis tools. Inappropriate treatment may result in reporting spurious expressed genes (false positives) and missing the real expressed genes (false negatives). Such errors impact the subsequent analysis, such as differential expression analysis. In our study, we observe that ∼3.5% of transcripts reported by TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline correspond to annotated nonfunctional pseudogenes. Moreover, ∼10.0% of reported transcripts are not annotated in the Ensembl database. These genes could be either novel expressed genes or false discoveries.Results:We examine the underlying genomic features that lead to multiple alignments and investigate how they generate systematic errors in RNA-seq analysis. We develop a general tool, GeneScissors, which exploits machine learning techniques guided by biological knowledge to detect and correct spurious transcriptome inference by existing RNA-seq analysis methods. In our simulated study, GeneScissors can predict spurious transcriptome calls owing to misalignment with an accuracy close to 90%. It provides substantial improvement over the widely used TopHat/Cufflinks or MapSplice/Cufflinks pipelines in both precision and F-measurement. On real data, GeneScissors reports 53.6% less pseudogenes and 0.97% more expressed and annotated transcripts, when compared with the TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline.

Identification of domain boundary locations is often the first step in protein folding and function annotations. Most of the current methods deduce domain boundaries by sequence-based analysis, which has low accuracy. There is no efficient method for predicting discontinuous domains that consist of segments from separated sequence regions. As template-based methods are most efficient for protein 3D structure modeling, combining multiple threading alignment information should increase the accuracy and reliability of computational domain predictions.Result:We developed a new protein domain predictor, ThreaDom, which deduces domain boundary locations based on multiple threading alignments. The core of the method development is the derivation of a domain conservation score that combines information from template domain structures and terminal and internal alignment gaps. Tested on 630 non-redundant sequences, without using homologous templates, ThreaDom generates correct single- and multi-domain classifications in 81% of cases, where 78% have the domain linker assigned within ±20 residues. In a second test on 486 proteins with discontinuous domains, ThreaDom achieves an average precision 84% and recall 65% in domain boundary prediction. Finally, ThreaDom was examined on 56 targets from CASP8 and had a domain overlap rate 73, 87 and 85% with the target for Free Modeling, Hard multiple-domain and discontinuous domain proteins, respectively, which are significantly higher than most domain predictors in the CASP8.

1355	http://ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/	1356	NULL	mapDamage2.0	Motivation:Ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules in fossilized bones and teeth, coprolites, sediments, mummified specimens and museum collections represent fantastic sources of information for evolutionary biologists, revealing the agents of past epidemics and the dynamics of past populations. However, the analysis of aDNA generally faces two major issues. Firstly, sequences consist of a mixture of endogenous and various exogenous backgrounds, mostly microbial. Secondly, high nucleotide misincorporation rates can be observed as a result of severepost-mortemDNA damage. Such misincorporation patterns are instrumental to authenticate ancient sequences versus modern contaminants. We recently developed the user-friendly mapDamage package that identifies such patterns from next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequence datasets. The absence of formal statistical modeling of the DNA damage process, however, precluded rigorous quantitative comparisons across samples.Results:Here, we describe mapDamage 2.0 that extends the original features of mapDamage by incorporating a statistical model of DNA damage. Assuming that damage events depend only on sequencing position andpost-mortemdeamination, our Bayesian statistical framework provides estimates of four key features of aDNA molecules: the average length of overhangs (λ), nick frequency (ν) and cytosine deamination rates in both double-stranded regions () and overhangs (). Our model enables rescaling base quality scores according to their probability of being damaged. mapDamage 2.0 handles NGS datasets with ease and is compatible with a wide range of DNA library protocols.Availability:mapDamage 2.0 is available atginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/as a Python package and documentation is maintained at the Centre for GeoGenetics Web site (geogenetics.ku.dk/publications/mapdamage2.0/).Contact:jonsson.hakon@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	22.0	5	1265	700	1449	2374	1891	0.415672425894	0.240812571367	0.128500258373	0.0923070402386	0.55395031836	-3.41257732776	-1.48111944132	NULL	1.0106001789	-2.34142252206

1364	http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/interevscore	1365	NULL	InterEvScore	Motivation:Structural prediction of protein interactions currently remains a challenging but fundamental goal. In particular, progress in scoring functions is critical for the efficient discrimination of near-native interfaces among large sets of decoys. Many functions have been developed using knowledge-based potentials, but few make use of multi-body interactions or evolutionary information, although multi-residue interactions are crucial for protein–protein binding and protein interfaces undergo significant selection pressure to maintain their interactions.Results:This article presents InterEvScore, a novel scoring function using a coarse-grained statistical potential including two- and three-body interactions, which provides each residue with the opportunity to contribute in its most favorable local structural environment. Combination of this potential with evolutionary information considerably improves scoring results on the 54 test cases from the widely used protein docking benchmark for which evolutionary information can be collected. We analyze how our way to include evolutionary information gradually increases the discriminative power of InterEvScore. Comparison with several previously published scoring functions (ZDOCK, ZRANK and SPIDER) shows the significant progress brought by InterEvScore.Availability:http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/interevscoreContact:guerois@cea.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	1274	96	406	1184	805	0.234492295492	0.229815522225	0.221847641633	0.218206798681	-2.21843141592	1.79241123035	1.48089625114	NULL	2.65282825854	0.326738742702

Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled a robust comparison of large numbers of simple tandem repeat loci; however, analysis of their variation using traditional sequence analysis approaches still remains limiting and problematic due to variants occurring in repeat sequences confusing alignment programs into mapping sequence reads to incorrect loci when the sequence reads are significantly different from the reference sequence.Results:We have developed a program, ReviSTER, which is an automated pipeline using a ‘local mapping reference reconstruction method’ to revise mismapped or partially misaligned reads at simple tandem repeat loci. RevisSTER estimates alleles of repeat loci using a local alignment method and creates temporary local mapping reference sequences, and finally remaps reads to the local mapping references. Using this approach, ReviSTER was able to successfully revise reads misaligned to repeat loci from both simulated data and real data.Availability:ReviSTER is open-source software available athttp://revister.sourceforge.net.Contact:garner@vbi.vt.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1275	1761	338	2359	286	0.329502369094	0.319478890851	0.273378548968	0.259073692867	0.251133726545	-2.92445282347	-2.20942024585	NULL	1.65593900618	0.0354372876005

Cheaper and faster sequencing technologies make it easy to generate very high coverage of bacterial genomes, but these advances mean that DNA preparation costs can exceed the cost of sequencing for small genomes. The need to contain costs often results in the creation of only a single sequencing library, which in turn introduces new challenges for genome assembly methods.Results:We evaluated the ability of multiple genome assembly programs to assemble bacterial genomes from a single, deep-coverage library. For our comparison, we chose bacterial species spanning a wide range of GC content and measured the contiguity and accuracy of the resulting assemblies. We compared the assemblies produced by this very high-coverage, one-library strategy to the best assemblies created by two-library sequencing, and we found that remarkably good bacterial assemblies are possible with just one library. We also measured the effect of read length and depth of coverage on assembly quality and determined the values that provide the best results with current algorithms.Contact:salzberg@jhu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	11.0	5	1276	1450	1397	2349	492	0.263107405193	0.25209791553	0.24730352336	0.241305544121	3.03981510043	-1.17055316844	-1.50450252163	NULL	-0.248217885212	-2.80742466784

However, scientists need access to tools that can condense, analyse and display the resulting data. Here, we present viRome, a package for R that takes aligned sequence data and produces a range of essential plots and reports.Availability and implementation:viRome is released under the BSD license as a package for R available for both Windows and Linuxhttp://virome.sf.net.

However, although multiple frameworks have been developed to facilitate access to these tools, comparatively little effort has been made at implementing low-level programming libraries to increase the speed and ease of their development.Results:We propose NGS++, a programming library in C++11 specialized in manipulating both next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets and genomic information files. This library allows easy integration of new formats and rapid prototyping of new functionalities with a focus on the analysis of genomic regions and features. It offers a powerful, yet versatile and easily extensible interface to read, write and manipulate multiple genomic file formats. By standardizing the internal data structures and presenting a common interface to the data parser, NGS++ offers an effective framework for epigenomics tool development.Availability:NGS++ was written in C++ using the C++11 standard. It requires minimal efforts to build and is well-documented via a complete docXygen guide, online documentation and tutorials.

1375	https://rubygems.org/gems/bio-svgenes	1376	NULL	SVGenes	Motivation:Drawing genomic features in attractive and informative ways is a key task in visualization of genomics data. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is a modern and flexible open standard that provides advanced features including modular graphic design, advanced web interactivity and animation within a suitable client. SVGs do not suffer from loss of image quality on re-scaling and provide the ability to edit individual elements of a graphic on the whole object level independent of the whole image. These features make SVG a potentially useful format for the preparation of publication quality figures including genomic objects such as genes or sequencing coverage and for web applications that require rich user-interaction with the graphical elements.Results:SVGenes is a Ruby-language library that uses SVG primitives to render typical genomic glyphs through a simple and flexible Ruby interface. The library implements a simple Page object that spaces and contains horizontal Track objects that in turn style, colour and positions features within them. Tracks are the level at which visual information is supplied providing the full styling capability of the SVG standard. Genomic entities like genes, transcripts and histograms are modelled in Glyph objects that are attached to a track and take advantage of SVG primitives to render the genomic features in a track as any of a selection of defined glyphs. The feature model within SVGenes is simple but flexible and not dependent on particular existing gene feature formats meaning graphics for any existing datasets can easily be created without need for conversion.Availability:The library is provided as a Ruby Gem fromhttps://rubygems.org/gems/bio-svgenesunder the MIT license, and open source code is available athttps://github.com/danmaclean/bioruby-svgenesalso under the MIT License.Contact:dan.maclean@tsl.ac.uk	0.0	4	1285	1790	960	1010	827	0.222630656813	0.171289293283	0.15931930279	0.154941042855	1.10721451067	-2.09824341914	0.518587087569	NULL	-0.961772415411	-0.0798761791262

1377	http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/SPANNER	1378	NULL	SPANNER	Background:Homology-based taxonomic assignment is impeded by differences between the unassigned read and reference database, forcing arank-specificclassification to the closest (and possibly incorrect) reference lineage. This assignment may be correct only to a general rank (e.g. order) and incorrect below that rank (e.g. family and genus). Algorithms like LCA avoid this by varying the predicted taxonomic rank based on matches to a set of taxonomic references. LCA and related approaches can be conservative, especially if best matches are taxonomically widespread because of events such as lateral gene transfer (LGT).Results:Our extension to LCA called SPANNER (similarity profile annotater) uses the set of best homology matches (the LCA Profile) for a given sequence and compares this profile with a set of profiles inferred from taxonomic reference organisms. SPANNER provides an assignment that is less sensitive to LGT and other confounding phenomena. In a series of trials on real and artificial datasets, SPANNER outperformed LCA-style algorithms in terms of taxonomic precision and outperformed best BLAST at certain levels of taxonomic novelty in the dataset. We identify examples where LCA made an overly conservative prediction, but SPANNER produced a more precise and correct prediction.Conclusions:By using profiles of homology matches to represent patterns of genomic similarity that arise because of vertical and lateral inheritance, SPANNER offers an effective compromise between taxonomic assignment based on best BLAST scores, and the conservative approach of LCA and similar approaches.Availability:C++ source code and binaries are freely available athttp://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/SPANNER.Contact:beiko@cs.dal.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1287	1428	1301	2194	574	0.385831998882	0.166673158993	0.145456454409	0.144026692772	0.242088870627	-1.59266926877	-2.91218888017	NULL	-0.618743413868	-1.23855393095

Although drug-target and antibody-target datasets are available in separate databases, they are not publicly available in an integrated bioinformatics resource. As medical therapeutics, especially in cancer, increasingly uses targeted drugs and measures their effects on biomolecular profiles, there is an unmet need for a user-friendly toolset that allows researchers to comprehensively and conveniently access and query information about drugs, antibodies and their targets.Summary:The PiHelper framework integrates human drug-target and antibody-target associations from publicly available resources to help meet the needs of researchers in systems pharmacology, perturbation biology and proteomics.

Although existingde novosequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universalde novosequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function.Results:The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovo+, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides).Availability:UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines.

This heterogeneity is a major confounder in standard analysis such as differential expression analysis, where differences in the relative proportions of the constituent cells may prevent or bias the detection of cell-specific differences. Computational deconvolution of global gene expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological processes at the cell-type level.

However, these strategies do not provide satisfactory performance in classifying short reads into their native domain families.Results:We introduce SALT, a protein domain classification tool based on profile hidden Markov models and graph algorithms. SALT carefully incorporates the characteristics of reads that are sequenced from the domain regions and assembles them into contigs based on a supervised graph construction algorithm. We applied SALT to two RNA-Seq datasets of different read lengths and quantified its performance using the available protein domain annotations and the reference genomes. Compared with existing strategies, SALT showed better sensitivity and accuracy. In the third experiment, we applied SALT to a non-model organism.

However, one of the first steps—to classify the operational taxonomic units within the sample—can be a computationally time-consuming task because most methods rely on computing the taxonomic assignment of each individual read out of tens to hundreds of thousands of reads.Results:We introduce Quikr: a QUadratic, K-mer–based, Iterative, Reconstruction method, which computes a vector of taxonomic assignments and their proportions in the sample using an optimization technique motivated from the mathematical theory of compressive sensing. On both simulated and actual biological data, we demonstrate that Quikr typically has less error and is typically orders of magnitude faster than the most commonly used taxonomic assignment technique (the Ribosomal Database Project’s Naïve Bayesian Classifier). Furthermore, the technique is shown to be unaffected by the presence of chimeras, thereby allowing for the circumvention of the time-intensive step of chimera filtering.Availability:The Quikr computational package (in MATLAB, Octave, Python and C) for the Linux and Mac platforms is available athttp://sourceforge.net/projects/quikr/.Contact:koslicki.1@mbi.osu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1301	1820	1287	2194	1428	0.173141062537	0.166673158993	0.162099499837	0.141578449901	0.329882275299	-1.32419314414	-2.62025954947	NULL	-0.628327033568	-1.13724721635

Despite that, the number of servers that provide an easy and comprehensive method to predict them is still limited. Here, we present iLoops, a web server that predicts whether a pair of proteins can interact using local structural features. The inputs of the server are as follows: (i) the sequences of the query proteins and (ii) the pairs to be tested. Structural features are assigned to the query proteins by sequence similarity. Pairs of structural features (formed by loops or domains) are classified according to their likelihood to favor or disfavor a protein–protein interaction, depending on their observation in known interacting and non-interacting pairs. The server evaluates the putative interaction using a random forest classifier.Availability:iLoops is available athttp://sbi.imim.es/iLoops.phpContact:baldo.oliva@upf.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1302	406	805	975	856	0.288913800744	0.240980165503	0.223932274527	0.213842237083	-2.10692229958	1.43259244441	1.25542638029	NULL	2.40596733178	0.583233608626

Short of undergoing a trial and error process, these experiments, as well as others, need to rely on an understanding of the specific determinants of the antibody binding mode.Results:In this article, we present a method to identify, on the basis of the antibody sequence alone, which residues of an antibody directly interact with its cognate antigen. The method, based on the random forest automatic learning techniques, reaches a recall and specificity as high as 80% and is implemented as a free and easy-to-use server, named prediction of Antibody Contacts. We believe that it can be of great help in re-design experiments as well as a guide for molecular docking experiments.

Although RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies have been widely used in measuring amounts of transcribed mRNA, accurate estimation of transcript isoform abundances from RNA-Seq data is challenging because reads often map to more than one transcript isoforms or paralogs whose sequences are similar to each other.Results:We propose a statistical method to estimate transcript isoform abundances from RNA-Seq data. Our method can handle gapped alignments of reads against reference sequences so that it allows insertion or deletion errors within reads. The proposed method optimizes the number of transcript isoforms by variational Bayesian inference through an iterative procedure, and its convergence is guaranteed under a stopping criterion. On simulated datasets, our method outperformed the comparable quantification methods in inferring transcript isoform abundances, and at the same time its rate of convergence was faster than that of the expectation maximization algorithm. We also applied our method to RNA-Seq data of human cell line samples, and showed that our prediction result was more consistent among technical replicates than those of other methods.Availability:An implementation of our method is available athttp://github.com/nariai/tigarContact:nariai@megabank.tohoku.ac.jpSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1305	2350	2393	730	1325	0.325267544599	0.314084090681	0.278133190897	0.269627136088	-2.40395393218	-1.29670319635	-1.88984783186	NULL	-1.75055186888	-2.31176362468

We sought to determine the overall extent of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify drivers.Results:We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the protein sequence. This method constructs the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria.

Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer–normal sequencing datasets are VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer–normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm.Results:Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.Availability:Data accession number SRA081939, code athttp://code.google.com/p/snv-caller-review/Contact:david.adelson@adelaide.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	7.0	5	1307	2172	1720	2243	1158	0.288511491259	0.282002683244	0.182641641103	0.175944392805	0.127575502594	1.23826639434	-4.0687075759	NULL	-2.26694662469	-1.23591741502
1398	http://nclab.hit.edu.cn/~wangjuan/Lnetwork/	1399	NULL	Lnetwork	Motivation:The evolutionary history of species is traditionally represented with a rooted phylogenetic tree. Each tree comprises a set of clusters, i.e. subsets of the species that are descended from a common ancestor. When rooted phylogenetic trees are built from several different datasets (e.g. from different genes), the clusters are often conflicting. These conflicting clusters cannot be expressed as a simple phylogenetic tree; however, they can be expressed in a phylogenetic network. Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that can account for processes such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer and recombination, which are difficult to represent in standard tree-like models of evolutionary histories. There is currently a large body of research aimed at developing appropriate methods for constructing phylogenetic networks from cluster sets. The Cassalgorithm can construct a much simpler network than other available methods, but is extremely slow for large datasets or for datasets that need lots of reticulate nodes. The networks constructed by Cassare also greatly dependent on the order of input data, i.e. it generally derives different phylogenetic networks for the same dataset when different input orders are used.Results:In this study, we introduce an improved Cassalgorithm, Lnetwork, which can construct a phylogenetic network for a given set of clusters. We show that Lnetworkis significantly faster than Cassand effectively weakens the influence of input data order. Moreover, we show that Lnetworkcan construct a much simpler network than most of the other available methods.Availability:Lnetworkhas been built as a Java software package and is freely available athttp://nclab.hit.edu.cn/∼wangjuan/Lnetwork/.Contact:maozuguo@hit.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1308	1038	2264	1076	1893	0.26105092412	0.256248353056	0.242208056156	0.2221563758	2.52678288838	1.57199591993	-0.188350656199	NULL	0.75077113088	-0.0984690554744

Membrane proteins constitute ∼30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. MoRFs were classified according to their secondary structure, after interacting with their partners. We identified MoRFs in transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins.

The number of beta-lactamases and their variants is steadily increasing. The horizontal gene transfer likely plays a major role in dissemination of these markers to new environments and hosts. Moreover, information about the beta-lactamase classes and their variants was scattered. Categorizing all these classes and their associated variants along with their epidemiology and resistance pattern information on one platform could be helpful to the researcher working on multidrug-resistant bacteria. Thus, the beta-lactamase database (BLAD) has been developed to provide comprehensive information (epidemiology and resistance pattern) on beta-lactamases. Beta-lactamase gene sequences in BLAD are linked with structural data, phenotypic data (i.e. antibiotic resistance) and literature references to experimental studies. In summary, BLAD integrates information that may provide insight into the epidemiology of multidrug resistance and enable the designing of novel drug candidates.Availability:The database can be accessed from the websitewww.blad.co.in.Contact:asad.k@rediffmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1310	994	1641	1825	1913	0.196589656532	0.11911342466	0.115376957049	0.0933076916834	-3.44558747636	2.03865677736	-0.299726211109	NULL	2.82191172637	-0.633663394907

The ncRNAome is composed of a multitude of RNAs, such as transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNA and microRNA (miRNA), to name few. Here we present omiRas, a Web server for the annotation, comparison and visualization of interaction networks of ncRNAs derived from next-generation sequencing experiments of two different conditions. The Web tool allows the user to submit raw sequencing data and results are presented as: (i) static annotation results including length distribution, mapping statistics, alignments and quantification tables for each library as well as lists of differentially expressed ncRNAs between conditions and (ii) an interactive network visualization of user-selected miRNAs and their target genes based on the combination of several miRNA–mRNA interaction databases.Availability and Implementation:The omiRas Web server is implemented in Python, PostgreSQL, R and can be accessed at:http://tools.genxpro.net/omiras/.Contact:rotter@genxpro.deSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	1321	860	1322	2246	828	0.243640521976	0.203661748419	0.19544578958	0.193969770007	-2.22512926197	-1.34306770107	1.54137740685	NULL	-1.27886633099	-2.27275644224

Although it is widely accepted that RNAs play important regulatory roles without necessarily coding for proteins, the functions of many of these non-coding RNAs are unknown. Thus, determining or modeling the 3D structure of RNA molecules as well as assessing their accuracy and stability has become of great importance for characterizing their functional activity. Here, we introduce a new web application, WebRASP, that uses knowledge-based potentials for scoring RNA structures based on distance-dependent pairwise atomic interactions. This web server allows the users to upload a structure in PDB format, select several options to visualize the structure and calculate the energy profile. The server contains online help, tutorials and links to other related resources. We believe this server will be a useful tool for predicting and assessing the quality of RNA 3D structures.Availability and implementation:The web server is available athttp://melolab.org/webrasp.

However, identifying functions of the protein clusters in A2ApsN is never trivial, due to a lack of linking characterized proteins to their relevant information in current software packages. Given the database errors introduced by automatic annotation transfer, functional deduction should be made from proteins with experimental studies, i.e. ‘reference proteins’. Here, we present a web server, termed Pclust, which provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the A2ApsN, placing emphasis on such ‘reference proteins’ and providing access to their full information in source databases, e.g. articles in PubMed. The identification of ‘reference proteins’ and the ease of cross-database linkage will facilitate understanding the functions of protein clusters in the network, thus promoting interpretation of proteins of interest.Availability:The Pclust server is freely available athttp://prodata.swmed.edu/pclustContact:grishin@chop.swmed.eduSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1323	406	767	805	1689	0.236180962349	0.235425194866	0.227578752278	0.215853720414	-1.86182637876	1.09608132139	1.51809179068	NULL	2.36139053716	0.626978063759

Increasing evidence points to important roles of 5-hmC in demethylation of 5-mC and epigenomic regulation in development. Recently developed experimental methods allow direct single-base profiling of either 5-hmC or 5-mC. Meaningful analyses seem to require combining these experiments with bisulfite sequencing, but doing so naively produces inconsistent estimates of 5-mC or 5-hmC levels.Results:We present a method to jointly model read counts from bisulfite sequencing, oxidative bisulfite sequencing and Tet-Assisted Bisulfite sequencing, providing simultaneous estimates of 5-hmC and 5-mC levels that are consistent across experiment types.Availability:http://smithlab.usc.edu/software/mlmlContact:andrewds@usc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary materialis available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1324	1796	1556	2355	1108	0.573458154343	0.320328529927	0.290109700368	0.19458663053	-1.19211731936	-1.88182822025	-2.31973113727	NULL	-1.92433734061	-1.73876264041

However, the extensive dynamic range of gene expression, technical limitations and biases, as well as the observed complexity of the transcriptional landscape, pose profound computational challenges for transcriptome reconstruction.Results:We present the novel framework MITIE (Mixed Integer Transcript IdEntification) for simultaneous transcript reconstruction and quantification. We define a likelihood function based on the negative binomial distribution, use a regularization approach to select a few transcripts collectively explaining the observed read data and show how to find the optimal solution using Mixed Integer Programming. MITIE can (i) take advantage of known transcripts, (ii) reconstruct and quantify transcripts simultaneously in multiple samples, and (iii) resolve the location of multi-mapping reads. It is designed for genome- and assembly-based transcriptome reconstruction. We present an extensive study based on realistic simulated RNA-Seq data. When compared with state-of-the-art approaches, MITIE proves to be significantly more sensitive and overall more accurate. Moreover, MITIE yields substantial performance gains when used with multiple samples. We applied our system to 38Drosophila melanogastermodENCODE RNA-Seq libraries and estimated the sensitivity of reconstructing omitted transcript annotations and the specificity with respect to annotated transcripts. Our results corroborate that a well-motivated objective paired with appropriate optimization techniques lead to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in transcriptome reconstruction.Availability:MITIE is implemented in C++ and is available fromhttp://bioweb.me/mitieunder the GPL license.Contact:Jonas_Behr@web.deandraetsch@cbio.mskcc.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	1325	2393	1305	1740	1258	0.301632712462	0.269627136088	0.219265720592	0.211743721174	-2.43086225493	-1.45184782157	-1.99299636175	NULL	-1.76400385718	-2.44080030273

However, available tools for network motif analysis typically require download and execution of computationally intensive software on a local computer. We present MotifNet, the first open-access web-server for network motif analysis. MotifNet allows researchers to analyze integrated networks, where nodes and edges may be labeled, and to search for motifs of up to eight nodes. The output motifs are presented graphically and the user can interactively filter them by their significance, number of instances, node and edge labels, and node identities, and view their instances. MotifNet also allows the user to distinguish between motifs that are centered on specific nodes and motifs that recur in distinct parts of the network.Availability and Implementation:MotifNet is freely available athttp://netbio.bgu.ac.il/motifnet.

Many text mining applications depend on accurate named entity recognition (NER) and normalization (grounding). While high performing machine learning methods trainable for many entity types exist for NER, normalization methods are usually specialized to a single entity type. NER and normalization systems are also typically used in a serial pipeline, causing cascading errors and limiting the ability of the NER system to directly exploit the lexical information provided by the normalization.Methods:We propose the first machine learning model for joint NER and normalization during both training and prediction. The model is trainable for arbitrary entity types and consists of a semi-Markov structured linear classifier, with a rich feature approach for NER and supervised semantic indexing for normalization. We also introduce TaggerOne, a Java implementation of our model as a general toolkit for joint NER and normalization. TaggerOne is not specific to any entity type, requiring only annotated training data and a corresponding lexicon, and has been optimized for high throughput.Results:We validated TaggerOne with multiple gold-standard corpora containing both mention- and concept-level annotations. Benchmarking results show that TaggerOne achieves high performance on diseases (NCBI Disease corpus, NER f-score: 0.829, normalization f-score: 0.807) and chemicals (BioCreative 5 CDR corpus, NER f-score: 0.914, normalization f-score 0.895). These results compare favorably to the previous state of the art, notwithstanding the greater flexibility of the model. We conclude that jointly modeling NER and normalization greatly improves performance.Availability and Implementation:The TaggerOne source code and an online demonstration are available at:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bionlp/taggeroneContact:zhiyong.lu@nih.govSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	7	1343	2367	625	1417	1634	0.279046469299	0.263366062487	0.202490464268	0.194315188958	-1.31712377738	-1.36858851051	-0.046193558704	NULL	-1.86501483422	1.48742988114

These methods belong to a broad class of mixed-membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation used to analyze text corpora. Inference from mixed-membership models can produce different output matrices when repeatedly applied to the same inputs, and the number of latent clusters is a parameter that is often varied in the analysis pipeline. For these reasons, quantifying, visualizing, and annotating the output from mixed-membership models are bottlenecks for investigators across multiple disciplines from ecology to text data mining.Results: We introduce pong, a network-graphical approach for analyzing and visualizing membership in latent clusters with a native interactive D3.js visualization. pong leverages efficient algorithms for solving the Assignment Problem to dramatically reduce runtime while increasing accuracy compared with other methods that process output from mixed-membership models. We apply pong to 225 705 unlinked genome-wide single-nucleotide variants from 2426 unrelated individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project, and identify previously overlooked aspects of global human population structure. We show that pong outpaces current solutions by more than an order of magnitude in runtime while providing a customizable and interactive visualization of population structure that is more accurate than those produced by current tools.Availability and Implementation:pong is freely available and can be installed using the Python package management system pip. pong’s source code is available athttps://github.com/abehr/pong.Contact:aaron_behr@alumni.brown.eduorsramachandran@brown.eduSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1344	2201	1697	2235	2257	0.142867454861	0.131664501991	0.131492731793	0.112805561128	-1.13576813711	0.572222502499	-3.13241563365	NULL	1.01529361066	1.4149237244

However, existing computational approaches forde novoprotein structure prediction often randomly sample protein conformational space as opposed to experimentally suggested stepwise sampling.Results:Here, we develop a novel generative, probabilistic model that simultaneously captures local structural preferences of backbone and side chain conformational space of polypeptide chains in a united-residue representation and performs experimentally motivated conditional conformational sampling via stepwise synthesis and assembly of foldon units that minimizes a composite physics and knowledge-based energy function forde novoprotein structure prediction. The proposed method, UniCon3D, has been found to (i) sample lower energy conformations with higher accuracy than traditional random sampling in a small benchmark of 6 proteins; (ii) perform comparably with the top five automated methods on 30 difficult target domains from the 11th Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment and on 15 difficult target domains from the 10th CASP experiment; and (iii) outperform two state-of-the-art approaches and a baseline counterpart of UniCon3D that performs traditional random sampling for protein modeling aided by predicted residue-residue contacts on 45 targets from the 10th edition of CASP.Availability and Implementation:Source code, executable versions, manuals and example data of UniCon3D for Linux and OSX are freely available to non-commercial users athttp://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/UniCon3D/.Contact:chengji@missouri.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	6	1345	1393	670	1698	1259	0.235216321481	0.199197729113	0.174397096822	0.172578546291	-1.26170656641	0.885472892317	3.38778894085	NULL	2.28638652102	-1.35742909755

There are dozens of computational methods available for miRNA target site prediction. Despite their existence, we still cannot reliably identify miRNA target sites, partially due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of miRNA target sites. The recently published CLASH (crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids) data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the characteristics of miRNA target sites and improve miRNA target site prediction methods.Results:Applying four different machine learning approaches to the CLASH data, we identified seven new features of miRNA target sites. Combining these new features with those commonly used by existing miRNA target prediction algorithms, we developed an approach called TarPmiR for miRNA target site prediction. Testing on two human and one mouse non-CLASH datasets, we showed that TarPmiR predicted more than 74.2% of true miRNA target sites in each dataset.

However, analysis of metagenomic composition is often complicated by the high complexity of the community and the lack of related reference genomic sequences. As a start point for comparative metagenomic analysis, the researchers require efficient means for assessing pairwise similarity of the metagenomes (beta-diversity). A number of approaches were used to address this task, however, most of them have inherent disadvantages that limit their scope of applicability. For instance, the reference-based methods poorly perform on metagenomes from previously unstudied niches, while composition-based methods appear to be too abstract for straightforward interpretation and do not allow to identify the differentially abundant features.Results:We developed MetaFast, an approach that allows to represent a shotgun metagenome from an arbitrary environment as a modified de Bruijn graph consisting of simplified components. For multiple metagenomes, the resulting representation is used to obtain a pairwise similarity matrix. The dimensional structure of the metagenomic components preserved in our algorithm reflects the inherent subspecies-level diversity of microbiota.

1451	https://sites.google.com/site/guoxian85/neggoa	1452	NULL	NegGOA	Motivation:Predicting the biological functions of proteins is one of the key challenges in the post-genomic era. Computational models have demonstrated the utility of applying machine learning methods to predict protein function. Most prediction methods explicitly require a set ofnegative examples—proteins that are knownnotcarrying out a particular function. However, Gene Ontology (GO) almost always only provides the knowledge that proteins carry out a particular function, and functional annotations of proteins are incomplete. GO structurally organizes more than tens of thousands GO terms and a protein is annotated with several (or dozens) of these terms. For these reasons, the negative examples of a protein can greatly help distinguishing true positive examples of the protein from such a large candidate GO space.Results:In this paper, we present a novel approach (called NegGOA) to select negative examples. Specifically, NegGOA takes advantage of the ontology structure, available annotations and potentiality of additional annotations of a protein to choose negative examples of the protein. We compare NegGOA with other negative examples selection algorithms and find that NegGOA produces much fewer false negatives than them. We incorporate the selected negative examples into an efficient function prediction model to predict the functions of proteins in Yeast, Human, Mouse and Fly. NegGOA also demonstrates improved accuracy than these comparing algorithms across various evaluation metrics. In addition, NegGOA is less suffered from incomplete annotations of proteins than these comparing methods.Availability and Implementation:The Matlab and R codes are available athttps://sites.google.com/site/guoxian85/neggoa.Contact:gxyu@swu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1361	957	1573	1821	1451	0.218918452454	0.194278728376	0.186973111613	0.17844033926	1.3420572772	-1.13465669415	3.56950331142	NULL	1.22148615327	2.11987578827

Cross-validation analysis showed that @MInter was able to detect abstracts pertaining to one or more microbial interactions with high specificity (specificity = 95%, AUC = 0.97). Despite challenges in identifying specific microbial interactions in an abstract (interaction level recall = 95%, precision = 25%), @MInter was shown to reduce annotator workload 13-fold compared to alternate approaches.

1453	http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/STRUM/	1454	NULL	STRUM	Motivation:Mutations in human genome are mainly through single nucleotide polymorphism, some of which can affect stability and function of proteins, causing human diseases. Several methods have been proposed to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability; but most require features from experimental structure. Given the fast progress in protein structure prediction, this work explores the possibility to improve the mutation-induced stability change prediction using low-resolution structure modeling.Results:We developed a new method (STRUM) for predicting stability change caused by single-point mutations. Starting from wild-type sequences, 3D models are constructed by the iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) simulations, where physics- and knowledge-based energy functions are derived on the I-TASSER models and used to train STRUM models through gradient boosting regression. STRUM was assessed by 5-fold cross validation on 3421 experimentally determined mutations from 150 proteins. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between predicted and measured changes of Gibbs free-energy gap, ΔΔG, upon mutation reaches 0.79 with a root-mean-square error 1.2 kcal/mol in the mutation-based cross-validations. The PCC reduces if separating training and test mutations from non-homologous proteins, which reflects inherent correlations in the current mutation sample. Nevertheless, the results significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods, including those built on experimental protein structures. Detailed analyses show that the most sensitive features in STRUM are the physics-based energy terms on I-TASSER models and the conservation scores from multiple-threading template alignments. However, the ΔΔG prediction accuracy has only a marginal dependence on the accuracy of protein structure models as long as the global fold is correct. These data demonstrate the feasibility to use low-resolution structure modeling for high-accuracy stability change prediction upon point mutations.Availability and Implementation:http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/STRUM/Contact:qiang@suda.edu.cnandzhng@umich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	6	1363	905	2	1975	154	0.329636733355	0.321388194136	0.30665191623	0.247308461529	-1.98061219701	1.69364578207	-0.0343163039424	NULL	1.76526041338	-1.28165699473
1454	https://github.com/hacone/AgIn	1455	NULL	AgIn	Motivation:Determining the methylation state of regions with high copy numbers is challenging for second-generation sequencing, because the read length is insufficient to map reads uniquely, especially when repetitive regions are long and nearly identical to each other. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions, because it is not vulnerable to GC bias, it produces long read lengths, and its kinetic information is sensitive to DNA modifications.Results:We propose a novel linear-time algorithm that combines the kinetic information for neighboring CpG sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites. Using a practical read coverage of ∼30-fold from an inbred strain medaka (Oryzias latipes), we observed that both the sensitivity and precision of our method on individual CpG sites were ∼93.7%. We also observed a high correlation coefficient (R= 0.884) between our method and bisulfite sequencing, and for 92.0% of CpG sites, methylation levels ranging over [0,1] were in concordance within an acceptable difference 0.25. Using this method, we characterized the landscape of the methylation status of repetitive elements, such as LINEs, in the human genome, thereby revealing the strong correlation between CpG density and hypomethylation and detecting hypomethylation hot spots of LTRs and LINEs. We uncovered the methylation states for nearly identical active transposons, two novel LINE insertions of identity ∼99% and length 6050 base pairs (bp) in the human genome, and 16Tol2elements of identity >99.8% and length 4682 bp in the medaka genome.Availability and Implementation:AgIn (Aggregate onIntervals) is available at:https://github.com/hacone/AgInContact:ysuzuki@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jpormoris@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	7	1364	1127	1293	711	1823	0.243726276149	0.24139195006	0.23891220925	0.216300757479	-1.28427106854	-0.974854985747	-3.27977619847	NULL	-2.59756089804	-1.74486950566

As the number of community-available ChIP-seq profiles increases, it becomes more common to use data from different sources, which makes joint analysis challenging. Issues such as lack of reproducibility, heterogeneous quality and conflicts between replicates become evident when comparing datasets, especially when they are produced by different laboratories.Results: Here, we present Zerone, a ChIP-seq discretizer with built-in quality control. Zerone is powered by a Hidden Markov Model with zero-inflated negative multinomial emissions, which allows it to merge several replicates into a single discretized profile. To identify low quality or irreproducible data, we trained a Support Vector Machine and integrated it as part of the discretization process. The result is a classifier reaching 95% accuracy in detecting low quality profiles. We also introduce a graphical representation to compare discretization quality and we show that Zerone achieves outstanding accuracy. Finally, on current hardware, Zerone discretizes a ChIP-seq experiment on mammalian genomes in about 5 min using less than 700 MB of memory.Availability and Implementation: Zerone is available as a command line tool and as an R package.

Therefore, for both basic research and drug development, it is important to identify the sumoylation sites in proteins.Results: To address such a problem, we developed a predictor called pSumo-CD by incorporating the sequence-coupled information into the general pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and introducing the covariance discriminant (CD) algorithm, in which a bias-adjustment term, which has the function to automatically adjust the errors caused by the bias due to the imbalance of training data, had been incorporated. Rigorous cross-validations indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperformed the existing state-of-the-art prediction method for the same purpose.Availability and implementation:For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for pSumo-CD has been established athttp://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pSumo-CD, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.Contact:jjia@gordonlifescience.org,xxiao@gordonlifescience.orgorkcchou@gordonlifescience.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	9.0	5	1373	1374	197	2080	1470	0.33400509999	0.230924149002	0.218316367385	0.215708609877	0.0781050546148	1.15187607572	2.00367768192	NULL	2.78575807207	0.552334807717
1464	http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPTM-mLys	1465	NULL	iPTM-mLys	Motivation:Post-translational modification, abbreviated as PTM, refers to the change of the amino acid side chains of a protein after its biosynthesis. Owing to its significance for in-depth understanding various biological processes and developing effective drugs, prediction of PTM sites in proteins have currently become a hot topic in bioinformatics. Although many computational methods were established to identify various single-label PTM types and their occurrence sites in proteins, no method has ever been developed for multi-label PTM types. As one of the most frequently observed PTMs, the K-PTM, namely, the modification occurring at lysine (K), can be usually accommodated with many different types, such as ‘acetylation’, ‘crotonylation’, ‘methylation’ and ‘succinylation’. Now we are facing an interesting challenge: given an uncharacterized protein sequence containing many K residues, which ones can accommodate two or more types of PTM, which ones only one, and which ones none?Results:To address this problem, a multi-label predictor callediPTM-mLyshas been developed. It represents the first multi-label PTM predictor ever established. The novel predictor is featured by incorporating the sequence-coupled effects into the general PseAAC, and by fusing an array of basic random forest classifiers into an ensemble system. Rigorous cross-validations via a set of multi-label metrics indicate that the first multi-label PTM predictor is very promising and encouraging.Availability and Implementation:For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server foriPTM-mLyshas been established athttp://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPTM-mLys, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.Contact:wqiu@gordonlifescience.org,xxiao@gordonlifescience.org,kcchou@gordonlifescience.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	11.0	5	1374	1373	1470	1612	1805	0.33400509999	0.274339163763	0.211388731041	0.193330213741	0.0817845296501	1.0477631181	1.99180549009	NULL	2.7636670842	0.754672147658
1465	https://github.com/johnbarton/ACE	1466	NULL	ACE	Motivation:Graphical models are often employed to interpret patterns of correlations observed in data through a network of interactions between the variables. Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random fields, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artificial datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.Results:We show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the underlying model when they are known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both biological and artificial data. Models inferred by ACE more accurately describe the statistics of the data, including both the constrained low-order correlations and unconstrained higher-order correlations, compared to those obtained by faster Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood methods. These alternative approaches can recover the structure of the interaction network but typically not the correct strength of interactions, resulting in less accurate generative models.Availability and implementation:The ACE source code, user manual and tutorials with the example data and filtered correlations described herein are freely available on GitHub athttps://github.com/johnbarton/ACE.Contacts:jpbarton@mit.edu,cocco@lps.ens.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	6	1375	2067	2002	1006	833	0.171519685728	0.143169993665	0.142340455914	0.130786773297	-1.03149629362	0.691964815313	0.312706714245	NULL	0.537435861579	0.615475728169

1467	http://vecuum.sourceforge.net/	1468	NULL	Vecuum	Motivation:Advances in sequencing technologies have remarkably lowered the detection limit of somatic variants to a low frequency. However, calling mutations at this range is still confounded by many factors including environmental contamination. Vector contamination is a continuously occurring issue and is especially problematic since vector inserts are hardly distinguishable from the sample sequences. Such inserts, which may harbor polymorphisms and engineered functional mutations, can result in calling false variants at corresponding sites. Numerous vector-screening methods have been developed, but none could handle contamination from inserts because they are focusing on vector backbone sequences alone.Results:We developed a novel method—Vecuum—that identifies vector-originated reads and resultant false variants. Since vector inserts are generally constructed from intron-less cDNAs, Vecuum identifies vector-originated reads by inspecting the clipping patterns at exon junctions. False variant calls are further detected based on the biased distribution of mutant alleles to vector-originated reads. Tests on simulated and spike-in experimental data validated that Vecuum could detect 93% of vector contaminants and could remove up to 87% of variant-like false calls with 100% precision. Application to public sequence datasets demonstrated the utility of Vecuum in detecting false variants resulting from various types of external contamination.Availability and Implementation:Java-based implementation of the method is available athttp://vecuum.sourceforge.net/Contact:swkim@yuhs.acSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1377	434	1369	2233	1913	0.25249143696	0.190075338531	0.182974993115	0.17120556584	1.69630366972	0.680342347099	-3.35450549346	NULL	-0.693563663012	-1.74928875192
1468	https://github.com/jacobhsu35/ISPP.git	1469	NULL	ISPP	Motivation:Exome sequencing studies have facilitated the detection of causal genetic variants in yet-unsolved Mendelian diseases. However, the identification of disease causal genes among a list of candidates in an exome sequencing study is still not fully settled, and it is often difficult to prioritize candidate genes for follow-up studies. The inheritance mode provides crucial information for understanding Mendelian diseases, but none of the existing gene prioritization tools fully utilize this information.Results:We examined the characteristics of Mendelian disease genes under different inheritance modes. The results suggest that Mendelian disease genes with autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance mode are more haploinsufficiency andde novomutation sensitive, whereas those autosomal recessive (AR) genes have significantly more non-synonymous variants and regulatory transcript isoforms. In addition, the X-linked (XL) Mendelian disease genes have fewer non-synonymous and synonymous variants. As a result, we derived a new scoring system for prioritizing candidate genes for Mendelian diseases according to the inheritance mode. Our scoring system assigned to each annotated protein-coding gene (N= 18 859) three pathogenic scores according to the inheritance mode (AD, AR and XL). This inheritance mode-specific framework achieved higher accuracy (area under curve= 0.84) in XL mode.Conclusion:The inheritance-mode specific pathogenicity prioritization (ISPP) outperformed other well-known methods including Haploinsufficiency, Recessive, Network centrality, Genic Intolerance, Gene Damage Index and Gene Constraint scores. This systematic study suggests that genes manifesting disease inheritance modes tend to have unique characteristics.Availability and implementation:ISPP is included in KGGSeq v1.0 (http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/kggseq/), and source code is available from (https://github.com/jacobhsu35/ISPP.git).Contact:mxli@hku.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	6	1378	1597	2086	609	2278	0.200358079795	0.196895487199	0.184404897817	0.183089767939	-0.915098496221	2.29505317894	-2.19598195845	NULL	-0.318236504743	1.55664477981

Within this problem context, determining multiple network alignments (MNA) is a significant challenge that involves high computational complexity. A limited number of public MNA implementations are available currently and the majority of the pairwise network alignment (PNA) algorithms do not have MNA counterparts. Furthermore, current MNA algorithms do not allow choosing a specific PPIN relative to which an MNA could be constructed. Also, once an MNA is obtained, it cannot easily be modified, such as through addition of a new network, without expensive re-computation of the entire MNA.Results:SMAL (Scaffold-Based Multiple Network Aligner) is a public, open-source, web-based application for determining MNAs from existing PNAs that addresses all the aforementioned challenges. With SMAL, PNAs can be combined rapidly to obtain an MNA. The software also supports visualization and user-data interactions to facilitate exploratory analysis and sensemaking. SMAL is especially useful when multiple alignments relative to a particular PPIN are required; furthermore, SMAL alignments are persistent in that existing correspondences between networks (obtained during PNA or MNA) are not lost as new networks are added.

With advances in both sequencing and computational technologies, it has become a new bottleneck in genomics studies. Indeed, evaluation ofde novogenome assemblies is one of the areas that can benefit from the visualization. However, even though multiple quality assessment methods are now available, existing visualization tools are hardly suitable for this purpose. Here, we present Icarus—a novel genome visualizer for accurate assessment and analysis of genomic draft assemblies, which is based on the tool QUAST. Icarus can be used in studies where a related reference genome is available, as well as for non-model organisms. The tool is available online and as a standalone application.Availability and Implementation:http://cab.spbu.ru/software/icarusContact:aleksey.gurevich@spbu.ruSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1391	2349	1667	1450	1077	0.27933776777	0.255446800207	0.153722850853	0.145286350964	3.12316793967	-1.23560196324	-1.32546149668	NULL	-0.133613611905	-2.89142549285

Several million individuals have been genotyped on single nucleotide variation arrays, which could be used for genome-wide CNVs association studies. However, CNV calls remain prone to false positives and only empirical filtering strategies exist in the literature. To overcome this issue, we defined a new quality score (QS) estimating the probability of a CNV called by PennCNV to be confirmed by other software.Results:Out-of-sample comparison showed that the correlation between the consensus CNV status and the QS is twice as high as it is for any previously proposed CNV filters. ROC curves displayed an AUC higher than 0.8 and simulations showed an increase up to 20% in statistical power when using QS in comparison to other filtering strategies. Superior performance was confirmed also for alternative consensus CNV definition and through improving known CNV-trait associations.Availability and Implementation:http://goo.gl/T6yuFMContact:zoltan.kutalik@unil.choraurelien@mace@unil.chSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1392	504	1000	2180	2160	0.423087876557	0.331343765488	0.279875038223	0.17406380856	0.68008530912	1.61835932565	-4.07601408466	NULL	-1.31857573535	-0.152599307374
1483	http://www.unres.pl/	1484	[590]	UNRES	Summary:Participating as the Cornell-Gdansk group, we have used our physics-based coarse-grained UNited RESidue (UNRES) force field to predict protein structure in the 11th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11). Our methodology involved extensive multiplexed replica exchange simulations of the target proteins with a recently improved UNRES force field to provide better reproductions of the local structures of polypeptide chains. All simulations were started from fully extended polypeptide chains, and no external information was included in the simulation process except for weak restraints on secondary structure to enable us to finish each prediction within the allowed 3-week time window. Because of simplified UNRES representation of polypeptide chains, use of enhanced sampling methods, code optimization and parallelization and sufficient computational resources, we were able to treat, for the first time, all 55 human prediction targets with sizes from 44 to 595 amino acid residues, the average size being 251 residues. Complete structures of six single-domain proteins were predicted accurately, with the highest accuracy being attained for the T0769, for which the CαRMSD was 3.8 Å for 97 residues of the experimental structure. Correct structures were also predicted for 13 domains of multi-domain proteins with accuracy comparable to that of the best template-based modeling methods. With further improvements of the UNRES force field that are now underway, our physics-based coarse-grained approach to protein-structure prediction will eventually reach global prediction capacity and, consequently, reliability in simulating protein structure and dynamics that are important in biochemical processes.Availability and Implementation:Freely available on the web athttp://www.unres.pl/.Contact:has5@cornell.edu	2.0	5	1393	1345	1259	379	1974	0.235216321481	0.207426816215	0.203370312173	0.185792499789	-1.40631671109	0.8621727491	3.29143424655	NULL	2.31276690916	-1.3114675231
1484	http://www.iet.unipi.it/a.bechini/swispot/	1485	NULL	SwiSpot	Motivation:Riboswitches are cis-regulatory elements in mRNA, mostly found in Bacteria, which exhibit two main secondary structure conformations. Although one of them prevents the gene from being expressed, the other conformation allows its expression, and this switching process is typically driven by the presence of a specific ligand. Although there are a handful of known riboswitches, our knowledge in this field has been greatly limited due to our inability to identify their alternate structures from their sequences. Indeed, current methods are not able to predict the presence of the two functionally distinct conformations just from the knowledge of the plain RNA nucleotide sequence. Whether this would be possible, for which cases, and what prediction accuracy can be achieved, are currently open questions.Results:Here we show that the two alternate secondary structures of riboswitches can be accurately predicted once the ‘switching sequence’ of the riboswitch has been properly identified. The proposed SwiSpot approach is capable of identifying the switching sequence inside a putative, complete riboswitch sequence, on the basis of pairing behaviors, which are evaluated on proper sets of configurations. Moreover, it is able to model the switching behavior of riboswitches whose generated ensemble covers both alternate configurations. Beyond structural predictions, the approach can also be paired to homology-based riboswitch searches.Availability and Implementation:SwiSpot software, along with the reference dataset files, is available at:http://www.iet.unipi.it/a.bechini/swispot/Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.Contact:a.bechini@ing.unipi.it	0.0	5	1394	1537	2325	1524	732	0.128442919624	0.126472148701	0.102952523138	0.10241576437	-1.21668282316	-0.0836290210204	3.29113449295	NULL	1.61503435838	-2.17026220674

The MAFFT MSA program has several options for building large MSAs, but their performances have not been sufficiently assessed yet, because realistic benchmarking of large MSAs has been difficult. Recently, such assessments have been made possible through the HomFam and ContTest benchmark protein datasets. Along with the development of these datasets, an interesting theory was proposed: chained guide trees increase the accuracy of MSAs of structurally conserved regions. This theory challenges the basis of progressive alignment methods and needs to be examined by being compared with other known methods including computationally intensive ones.Results:We used HomFam, ContTest and OXFam (an extended version of OXBench) to evaluate several methods enabled in MAFFT: (1) a progressive method with approximate guide trees, (2) a progressive method with chained guide trees, (3) a combination of an iterative refinement method and a progressive method and (4) a less approximate progressive method that uses a rigorous guide tree and consistency score. Other programs, Clustal Omega and UPP, available for large MSAs, were also included into the comparison. The effect of method 2 (chained guide trees) was positive in ContTest but negative in HomFam and OXFam. Methods 3 and 4 increased the benchmark scores more consistently than method 2 for the three datasets, suggesting that they are safer to use.Availability and Implementation:http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/Contact:katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	7	1395	517	2161	937	2140	0.196468336104	0.158943497669	0.155844357344	0.143739954338	1.90638226176	-0.61686190445	-0.143986823227	NULL	0.835331144944	-0.887287768196

Moreover, promising novel applications of HTS technology require aligning reads to multiple genomes instead of a single reference; however, it is still not viable for the state-of-the-art aligners to align large numbers of reads to multiple genomes.Results:We propose de Bruijn Graph-based Aligner (deBGA), an innovative graph-based seed-and-extension algorithm to align HTS reads to a reference genome that is organized and indexed using a de Bruijn graph. With its well-handling of repeats, deBGA is substantially faster than state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining similar or higher sensitivity and accuracy. This makes it particularly well-suited to handle the rapidly growing volumes of sequencing data.

Accordingly, we will able to generate more and more data with high speed at fixed cost, but lack the computational resources to store, process and analyze it. With error prone high throughput NGS reads and genomic repeats, the assembly graph contains massive amount of redundant nodes and branching edges. Most assembly pipelines require this large graph to reside in memory to start their workflows, which is intractable for mammalian genomes. Resource-efficient genome assemblers combine both the power of advanced computing techniques and innovative data structures to encode the assembly graph efficiently in a computer memory.Results:LightAssembler is a lightweight assembly algorithm designed to be executed on a desktop machine.

Our method reduces the memory usage by50%50%50%compared to the resource-efficient assemblers using benchmark datasets from GAGE and Assemblathon projects.

In these settings, many classical techniques including linear discriminant analysis (LDA) falter. Poor performance of LDA is attributed to the ill-conditioned nature of sample covariance matrix when the dimension and sample size are comparable. To alleviate this problem, regularized LDA (RLDA) has been classically proposed in which the sample covariance matrix is replaced by its ridge estimate. However, the performance of RLDA depends heavily on the regularization parameter used in the ridge estimate of sample covariance matrix.Results:We propose a range-search technique for efficient estimation of the optimum regularization parameter. Using an extensive set of simulations based on synthetic and gene expression microarray data, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique to Gaussianity, an assumption used in developing the core estimator. We compare the performance of the technique in terms of accuracy and efficiency with classical techniques for estimating the regularization parameter. In terms of accuracy, the results indicate that the proposed method vastly improves on similar techniques that use classical plug-in estimator. In that respect, it is better or comparable to cross-validation-based search strategies while, depending on the sample size and dimensionality, being tens to hundreds of times faster to compute.Availability and Implementation:The source code is available athttps://github.com/danik0411/optimum-rldaContact:amin.zollanvari@nu.edu.kzSupplementary information:Supplementary materialsare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1410	571	993	847	1301	0.132800505073	0.131856183501	0.123185536136	0.115338008969	0.35015681423	-0.548321485092	-2.51017479456	NULL	-1.16551844756	-0.325553439661

The detection of functional modules in PPI networks is often performed by identifying internally densely connected subnetworks, and often produces modules with “core” and “peripheral” proteins. The core proteins are the ones having dense connections to each other in a module. The difference between core and peripheral proteins is important to understand the functional roles of proteins in modules, but there are few methods to explicitly elucidate the internal structure of functional modules at gene level.Results:We propose NCMine, which is a novel network clustering method and visualization tool for the core-peripheral structure of functional modules. It extracts near-complete subgraphs from networks based on a node-weighting scheme using degree centrality, and reports subgroups as functional modules. We implemented this method as a plugin of Cytoscape, which is widely used to visualize and analyze biological networks. The plugin allows users to extract functional modules from PPI networks and interactively filter modules of interest. We applied the method to human PPI networks, and found several examples with the core-peripheral structure of modules that may be related to cancer development.Availability and Implementation:The Cytoscape plugin and tutorial are available at Cytoscape AppStore.

The procedure is not only very cost effective but also can be done in laboratory environment. The state-of-the-art sequence assemblers then construct the whole genomic sequence from these reads. Current cutting edge computing technology makes it possible to build genomic sequences from the billions of reads within a minimal cost and time. As a consequence, we see an explosion of biological sequences in recent times. In turn, the cost of storing the sequences in physical memory or transmitting them over the internet is becoming a major bottleneck for research and future medical applications. Data compression techniques are one of the most important remedies in this context. We are in need of suitable data compression algorithms that can exploit the inherent structure of biological sequences. Although standard data compression algorithms are prevalent, they are not suitable to compress biological sequencing data effectively. In this article, we propose a novel referential genome compression algorithm (NRGC) to effectively and efficiently compress the genomic sequences.Results:We have done rigorous experiments to evaluate NRGC by taking a set of real human genomes. The simulation results show that our algorithm is indeed an effective genome compression algorithm that performs better than the best-known algorithms in most of the cases.

Bisulfite sequencing is a widely used technique to obtain genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, and one of the key tasks of analyzing bisulfite sequencing data is to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among samples under different treatment conditions. Although numerous tools have been proposed to detect differentially methylated single CpG site (DMC) between samples, methods for direct DMR detection, especially for complex study designs, are largely limited.Results:We present a new software, GetisDMR, for direct DMR detection. We use beta-binomial regression to model the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, where variations in methylation levels and confounding effects have been accounted for. We employ a region-wise test statistic, which is derived from local Getis-Ord statistics and considers the spatial correlation between nearby CpG sites, to detect DMRs. Unlike existing methods, that attempt to infer DMRs from DMCs based on empirical criteria, we provide statistical inference for direct DMR detection. Through extensive simulations and an application to two mouse datasets, we demonstrate that GetisDMR achieves better sensitivities, positive predictive values, more exact locations and better agreement of DMRs with current biological knowledge.Availability and Implementation:It is available athttps://github.com/DMU-lilab/GetisDMR.Contacts:y.wen@auckland.ac.nzorzhiguangli@dlmedu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1413	1848	1456	1108	1293	0.321995265838	0.251913939498	0.235259414454	0.210950852914	-1.3093362616	-0.954650849189	-3.25928127078	NULL	-2.66686892951	-1.5732719293

For example, it can be used to discover biomarkers to classify cancer samples into previously unknown subtypes such that better diagnosis and therapy methods can be developed for the subtypes. Although several DTE tools for population data, i.e. data without known biological conditions, have been published, these tools either assume binary conditions in the input population or require the number of conditions as a part of the input. Fixing the number of conditions to binary is unrealistic and may distort the results of a DTE analysis. Estimating the correct number of conditions in a population could also be challenging for a routine user. Moreover, the existing tools only provide differential usages of exons, which may be insufficient to interpret the patterns of alternative splicing across samples and restrains the applications of the tools from many biology studies.Results:We propose a novel DTE analysis algorithm, called SDEAP, that estimates the number of conditions directly from the input samples using a Dirichlet mixture model and discovers alternative splicing events using a new graph modular decomposition algorithm. By taking advantage of the above technical improvement, SDEAP was able to outperform the other DTE analysis methods in our extensive experiments on simulated data and real data with qPCR validation.

ChemTreeMap synergistically combines extended connectivity fingerprints and a neighbor-joining algorithm to produce a hierarchical tree with branch lengths proportional to molecular similarity. Compound properties are shown by leaf color, size and outline to yield a user-defined visualization of the tree. Two representative analyses are included to demonstrate ChemTreeMap’s capabilities and utility: assessing dataset overlap and mining structure–activity relationships.Availability and Implementation:The examples from this paper may be accessed athttp://ajing.github.io/ChemTreeMap/.

However, current methods have variable sensitivities in detecting different types of genetic variants. One type of such genetic variants that is especially hard to detect is inversions. Analysis of public databases showed that few short inversions have been reported so far. Unlike reads that contain small insertions or deletions, which will be considered through gap alignment, reads carrying short inversions often have poor mapping quality or are unmapped, thus are often not further considered. As a result, the majority of short inversions might have been overlooked and require special algorithms for their detection.Results:Here, we introduce SRinversion, a framework to analyze poorly mapped or unmapped reads by splitting and re-aligning them for the purpose of inversion detection. SRinversion is very sensitive to small inversions and can detect those less than 10 bp in size. We applied SRinversion to both simulated data and high-coverage sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project and compared the results with those from Pindel, BreakDancer, DELLY, Gustaf and MID. A better performance of SRinversion was achieved for both datasets for the detection of small inversions.Availability and Implementation:SRinversion is implemented in Perl and is publicly available athttp://paed.hku.hk/genome/software/SRinversion/index.html.Contact:yangwl@hku.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1426	1208	1833	1741	1872	0.147362927353	0.145081146644	0.143708725244	0.13214967844	1.95105077003	-0.313350923528	-3.19351465392	NULL	-0.183115921418	-2.87136080653

In the absence of reference genomes for most environmental microorganisms, the use of intrinsic nucleotide patterns and phylogenetic anchors can improve assembly-dependent binning needed for more accurate taxonomic and functional annotation in communities of microorganisms, and assist in identifying mobile genetic elements or lateral gene transfer events.Results:Here, we present a statistic called LCA* inspired by Information and Voting theories that uses the NCBI Taxonomic Database hierarchy to assign taxonomy to contigs assembled from environmental sequence information. The LCA* algorithm identifies a sufficiently strong majority on the hierarchy while minimizing entropy changes to the observed taxonomic distribution resulting in improved statistical properties. Moreover, we apply results from the order-statistic literature to formulate a likelihood-ratio hypothesis test andP-value for testing the supremacy of the assigned LCA* taxonomy. Using simulated and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that voting-based methods, majority vote and LCA*, in the presence of known reference annotations, are consistently more accurate in identifying contig taxonomy than the lowest common ancestor algorithm popularized by MEGAN, and that LCA* taxonomy strikes a balance between specificity and confidence to provide an estimate appropriate to the available information in the data.Availability and Implementation:The LCA* has been implemented as a stand-alone Python library compatible with the MetaPathways pipeline; both of which are available on GitHub with installation instructions and use-cases (http://www.github.com/hallamlab/LCAStar/).Contact:shallam@mail.ubc.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1428	1287	2056	574	1301	0.385831998882	0.215572549078	0.154605517108	0.141578449901	0.250151110711	-1.63335724963	-2.96056088002	NULL	-0.67575957888	-1.3054456031

1527	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/	1528	NULL	GWAS	Motivation:LD score regression is a reliable and efficient method of using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level results data to estimate the SNP heritability of complex traits and diseases, partition this heritability into functional categories, and estimate the genetic correlation between different phenotypes. Because the method relies on summary level results data, LD score regression is computationally tractable even for very large sample sizes. However, publicly available GWAS summary-level data are typically stored in different databases and have different formats, making it difficult to apply LD score regression to estimate genetic correlations across many different traits simultaneously.Results:In this manuscript, we describe LD Hub - a centralized database of summary-level GWAS results for 173 diseases/traits from different publicly available resources/consortia and a web interface that automates the LD score regression analysis pipeline. To demonstrate functionality and validate our software, we replicated previously reported LD score regression analyses of 49 traits/diseases using LD Hub; and estimated SNP heritability and the genetic correlation across the different phenotypes. We also present new results obtained by uploading a recent atopic dermatitis GWAS meta-analysis to examine the genetic correlation between the condition and other potentially related traits. In response to the growing availability of publicly accessible GWAS summary-level results data, our database and the accompanying web interface will ensure maximal uptake of the LD score regression methodology, provide a useful database for the public dissemination of GWAS results, and provide a method for easily screening hundreds of traits for overlapping genetic aetiologies.Availability and Implementation:The web interface and instructions for using LD Hub are available athttp://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/Contact:jie.zheng@bristol.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	12	1437	953	938	2113	2268	0.318895503567	0.295656315832	0.291927075182	0.260148108629	-1.18989383915	1.4837337046	-2.71841271212	NULL	0.93074590003	1.67891023607

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) was developed to enable interoperability of heterogeneous datasets. The EBI-RDF platform enables an efficient data integration of six independent biological databases using RDF technologies and shared ontologies. However, to take advantage of this platform, biologists need to be familiar with RDF technologies and SPARQL query language. To overcome this practical limitation of the EBI-RDF platform, we developed cMapper, a web-based tool that enables biologists to search the EBI-RDF databases in a gene-centric manner without a thorough knowledge of RDF and SPARQL.Results:cMapper allows biologists to search data entities in the EBI-RDF platform that are connected to genes or small molecules of interest in multiple biological contexts. The input to cMapper consists of a set of genes or small molecules, and the output are data entities in six independent EBI-RDF databases connected with the given genes or small molecules in the user's query. cMapper provides output to users in the form of a graph in which nodes represent data entities and the edges represent connections between data entities and inputted set of genes or small molecules. Furthermore, users can apply filters based on database, taxonomy, organ and pathways in order to focus on a core connectivity graph of their interest. Data entities from multiple databases are differentiated based on background colors. cMapper also enables users to investigate shared connections between genes or small molecules of interest. Users can view the output graph on a web browser or download it in either GraphML or JSON formats.Availability and Implementation:cMapper is available as a web application with an integrated MySQL database.

1529	https://bitbucket.org/irenerodriguez/fbb	1530	NULL	FBB	Motivation:Despite RNA-seq reads provide quality scores that represent the probability of calling a correct base, these values are not probabilistically integrated in most alignment algorithms. Based on the quality scores of the reads, we propose to calculate a lower bound of the probability of alignment of any fast alignment algorithm that generates SAM files. This bound is called Fast Bayesian Bound (FBB) and serves as a canonical reference to compare alignment results across different algorithms. This Bayesian Bound intends to provide additional support to the current state-of-the-art aligners, not to replace them.Results:We propose a feasible Bayesian bound that uses quality scores of the reads to align them to a genome of reference. Two theorems are provided to efficiently calculate the Bayesian bound that under some conditions becomes the equality. The algorithm reads the SAM files generated by the alignment algorithms using multiple command option values. The program options are mapped into the FBB reference values, and all the aligners can be compared respect to the same accuracy values provided by the FBB. Stranded paired read RNA-seq data was used for evaluation purposes. The errors of the alignments can be calculated based on the information contained in the distance between the pairs given by Theorem 2, and the alignments to the incorrect strand. Most of the algorithms (Bowtie, Bowtie 2, SHRiMP2, Soap 2, Novoalign) provide similar results with subtle variations.Availability and Implementation:Current version of the FBB software is provided athttps://bitbucket.org/irenerodriguez/fbb.Contact:rhuerta@ucsd.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1439	1087	168	836	516	0.225625558727	0.225145378253	0.217060061886	0.212952010152	1.99509944817	-1.9774864664	-1.70024400698	NULL	0.321760974072	-2.46126508153
1530	https://github.com/hitbc/LAMSA	1531	NULL	LAMSA	Motivation: Read length is continuously increasing with the development of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies, which has enormous potentials on cutting-edge genomic studies. However, longer reads could more frequently span the breakpoints of structural variants (SVs) than that of shorter reads. This may greatly influence read alignment, since most state-of-the-art aligners are designed for handling relatively small variants in a co-linear alignment framework. Meanwhile, long read alignment is still not as efficient as that of short reads, which could be also a bottleneck for the upcoming wide application.Results:We propose long approximate matches-based split aligner (LAMSA), a novel split read alignment approach. It takes the advantage of the rareness of SVs to implement a specifically designed two-step strategy. That is, LAMSA initially splits the read into relatively long fragments and co-linearly align them to solve the small variations or sequencing errors, and mitigate the effect of repeats. The alignments of the fragments are then used for implementing a sparse dynamic programming-based split alignment approach to handle the large or non-co-linear variants. We benchmarked LAMSA with simulated and real datasets having various read lengths and sequencing error rates, the results demonstrate that it is substantially faster than the state-of-the-art long read aligners; meanwhile, it also has good ability to handle various categories of SVs.Availability and Implementation:LAMSA is available athttps://github.com/hitbc/LAMSAContact:Ydwang@hit.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1440	1833	747	1148	1746	0.327364505022	0.277156841345	0.257971956551	0.253050268745	2.06384371049	-1.30330293344	-2.69256529261	NULL	-0.450812449059	-2.91781111918

Somatically acquired SV may regulate the expression of tumor-related genes and result in cell proliferation and uncontrolled growth, eventually inducing tumor formation. Virus integration with host genome sequence is a type of SV that causes the related gene instability and normal cells to transform into tumor cells. Cancer SVs and viral integration sites must be discovered in a genome-wide scale for clarifying the mechanism of tumor occurrence and development.Results:In this paper, we propose a new tool called seeksv to detect somatic SVs and viral integration events. Seeksv simultaneously uses split read signal, discordant paired-end read signal, read depth signal and the fragment with two ends unmapped. Seeksv can detect DEL, insertion, inversion and inter-chromosome transfer at single-nucleotide resolution. Different types of sequencing data, such as single-end sequencing data or paired-end sequencing data can accommodate to detect SV. Seeksv develops a rescue model for SV with breakpoints located in sequence homology regions.

Most existing scaffolding tools adopt scaffold graph approaches. However, due to repetitive regions in genome, sequencing errors and uneven sequencing depth, constructing an accurate scaffold graph is still a challenge task.Results:In this paper, we present a novel algorithm (called BOSS), which employs paired reads for scaffolding. To construct a scaffold graph, BOSS utilizes the distribution of insert size to decide whether an edge between two vertices (contigs) should be added and how an edge should be weighed. Moreover, BOSS adopts an iterative strategy to detect spurious edges whose removal can guarantee no contradictions in the scaffold graph. Based on the scaffold graph constructed, BOSS employs a heuristic algorithm to sort vertices (contigs) and then generates scaffolds. The experimental results demonstrate that BOSS produces more satisfactory scaffolds, compared with other popular scaffolding tools on real sequencing data of four genomes.Availability and Implementation:BOSS is publicly available for download athttps://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/BOSS.Contact:jxwang@mail.csu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1442	1743	2009	2318	1871	0.342457724321	0.297423624167	0.255120496342	0.225715004832	2.9839240557	-2.33004287155	-1.55640950288	NULL	0.799446967651	-2.74917446048

For example, genomics data is increasingly large and distributed, and the data needs to be moved into workflow execution sites ranging from lab workstations to the cloud. However, the typical user is not always informed on emerging network technology or the most efficient methods to move and share data. Thus, the user defaults to using inefficient methods for transfer across the commercial internet.Results:To accelerate large data transfer, we created a tool called the Big Data Smart Socket (BDSS) that abstracts data transfer methodology from the user. The user provides BDSS with a manifest of datasets stored in a remote storage repository. BDSS then queries a metadata repository for curated data transfer mechanisms and optimal path to move each of the files in the manifest to the site of workflow execution. BDSS functions as a standalone tool or can be directly integrated into a computational workflow such as provided by the Galaxy Project. To demonstrate applicability, we use BDSS within a biological context, although it is applicable to any scientific domain.Availability and Implementation:BDSS is available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License athttps://github.com/feltus/BDSS.Contact:ffeltus@clemson.edu	0.0	5	1443	1849	641	250	2472	0.140808767907	0.109530155619	0.106386784328	0.105951459247	0.338564697295	-2.41416003745	0.250500676672	NULL	-2.378314372	0.666581204108

Many computational experiments are difficult to apply exhaustively in network analysis due to run-times. To permit high-throughput analysis of gene networks, we have implemented a set of very efficient tools to calculate functional properties in networks based on guilt-by-association methods.EGAD(Extending ′Guilt-by-Association′ byDegree) allows gene networks to be evaluated with respect to hundreds or thousands of gene sets. The methods predict novel members of gene groups, assess how well a gene network groups known sets of genes, and determines the degree to which generic predictions drive performance. By allowing fast evaluations, whether of random sets or real functional ones,EGADprovides the user with an assessment of performance which can easily be used in controlled evaluations across many parameters.Availability and Implementation:The software package is freely available athttps://github.com/sarbal/EGADand implemented for use in R and Matlab.

Constraint-based and pattern-based methodologies have been used for automated gap filling of these networks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, since validation of hypotheses made by gap filling tools require experimentation, it is challenging to benchmark performance and make improvements other than that related to speed and scalability.Results:We present BoostGAPFILL, an open source tool that leverages both constraint-based and machine learning methodologies for hypotheses generation in gap filling and metabolic model refinement. BoostGAPFILL uses metabolite patterns in the incomplete network captured using a matrix factorization formulation to constrain the set of reactions used to fill gaps in a metabolic network. We formulate a testing framework based on the available metabolic reconstructions and demonstrate the superiority of BoostGAPFILL to state-of-the-art gap filling tools. We randomly delete a number of reactions from a metabolic network and rate the different algorithms on their ability to both predict the deleted reactions from a universal set and to fill gaps. For most metabolic network reconstructions tested, BoostGAPFILL shows above 60% precision and recall, which is more than twice that of other existing tools.Availability and Implementation:MATLAB open source implementation (https://github.com/Tolutola/BoostGAPFILL)Contacts:toyetunde@wustl.eduormuhan@wustl.edu.Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1445	1469	505	1603	2210	0.277003004528	0.191879890217	0.19017422243	0.184801626821	2.59329833288	1.06287551349	1.88855670023	NULL	-0.36321783515	2.99240091427

Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6–145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer.

Unlike a traditional international collaboration model, where individual-level patient DNA are physically centralized at a single site, PRINCESS performs a secure and distributed computation over encrypted data, fulfilling institutional policies and regulations for protected health information.Results:To demonstrate PRINCESS’ performance and feasibility, we conducted a family-based allelic association study for Kawasaki Disease, with data hosted in three different continents.

Various automatic methods have been proposed to predict locations for large scale protein datasets, where statistical machine learning algorithms are widely used for model construction. A key step in these predictors is encoding the amino acid sequences into feature vectors. Many studies have shown that features extracted from biological domains, such as gene ontology and functional domains, can be very useful for improving the prediction accuracy. However, domain knowledge usually results in redundant features and high-dimensional feature spaces, which may degenerate the performance of machine learning models.Results:In this paper, we propose a new amino acid sequence-based human protein subcellular location prediction approach Hum-mPLoc 3.0, which covers 12 human subcellular localizations. The sequences are represented by multi-view complementary features, i.e. context vocabulary annotation-based gene ontology (GO) terms, peptide-based functional domains, and residue-based statistical features. To systematically reflect the structural hierarchy of the domain knowledge bases, we propose a novel feature representation protocol denoted as HCM (Hidden Correlation Modeling), which will create more compact and discriminative feature vectors by modeling the hidden correlations between annotation terms. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that HCM improves prediction accuracy by 5–11% andF1by 8–19% compared with conventional GO-based methods. A large-scale application of Hum-mPLoc 3.0 on the whole human proteome reveals proteins co-localization preferences in the cell.Availability and Implementation:www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/Hum-mPLoc3/Contacts:hbshen@sjtu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1499	315	1259	1803	818	0.315527150245	0.236055251359	0.229601877085	0.218205410539	-2.46935895313	-0.517903414949	3.34486546446	NULL	2.63867237957	-0.736655574321

1596	http://curie.utmb.edu/Cross-React.html	1597	NULL	Cross-React	The phenomenon of cross-reactivity between allergenic proteins plays an important role to understand how the immune system recognizes different antigen proteins. Allergen proteins are known to cross-react if their sequence comparison shows a high sequence identity which also implies that the proteins have a similar 3D fold. In such cases, linear sequence alignment methods are frequently used to predict cross-reactivity between allergenic proteins. However, the prediction of cross-reactivity between distantly related allergens continues to be a challenging task. To overcome this problem, we developed a new structure-based computational method, Cross-React, to predict cross-reactivity between allergenic proteins available in the Structural Database of Allergens (SDAP). Our method is based on the hypothesis that we can find surface patches on 3D structures of potential allergens with amino acid compositions similar to an epitope in a known allergen. We applied the Cross-React method to a diverse set of seven allergens, and successfully identified several cross-reactive allergens with high to moderate sequence identity which have also been experimentally shown to cross-react. Based on these findings, we suggest that Cross-React can be used as a predictive tool to assess protein allergenicity and cross-reactivity.Availability and Implementation: Cross-React is available at:http://curie.utmb.edu/Cross-React.htmlContact:ssnegi@utmb.edu	0.0	6	1506	2449	2425	696	1937	0.356494474231	0.215581882595	0.203802623788	0.17337465211	-3.93667345615	0.0581765523662	1.01578764349	NULL	1.33842568472	-1.91550255595

If this shared genealogy can be inferred from haplotypes, it can be very useful for many population genetics problems. However, with the presence of recombination, the genealogical history of haplotypes is complex and cannot be represented by a single genealogical tree. Therefore, inference of genealogical history with recombination is much more challenging than the case of no recombination.Results: In this paper, we present a new approach calledRENT+for the inference of local genealogical trees from haplotypes with the presence of recombination.RENT+builds on a previous genealogy inference approach calledRENT, which infers a set of related genealogical trees at different genomic positions.RENT+represents a significant improvement overRENTin the sense that it is more effective in extracting information contained in the haplotype data about the underlying genealogy thanRENT. The key components ofRENT+are several greatly enhanced genealogy inference rules. Through simulation, we show thatRENT+is more efficient and accurate than several existing genealogy inference methods. As an application, we applyRENT+in the inference of population demographic history from haplotypes, which outperforms several existing methods.Availability and Implementation:RENT+is implemented in Java, and is freely available for download from:https://github.com/SajadMirzaei/RentPlus.Contacts:sajad@engr.uconn.eduorywu@engr.uconn.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available at Bioinformatics online.	0.0	5	1507	1681	309	1338	2251	0.26458308766	0.169996509186	0.162376297297	0.148313823602	0.747899658689	2.48068958799	-1.63871467319	NULL	1.16168148433	0.592366852074

Chromatin accessibility experiments such as DNaseI sequencing (DNase-seq) and Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) produce genome-wide data that include distinct ‘footprint’ patterns at binding sites. Nearly all existing computational methods to detect footprints from these data assume that footprint signals are highly homogeneous across footprint sites. Additionally, a comprehensive and systematic comparison of footprinting methods for specifically identifying which motif sites for a specific factor are bound has not been performed.Results:Using DNase-seq data from the ENCODE project, we show that a large degree of previously uncharacterized site-to-site variability exists in footprint signal across motif sites for a transcription factor. To model this heterogeneity in the data, we introduce a novel, supervised learning footprinter called Detecting Footprints Containing Motifs (DeFCoM). We compare DeFCoM to nine existing methods using evaluation sets from four human cell-lines and eighteen transcription factors and show that DeFCoM outperforms current methods in determining bound and unbound motif sites. We also analyze the impact of several biological and technical factors on the quality of footprint predictions to highlight important considerations when conducting footprint analyses and assessing the performance of footprint prediction methods. Finally, we show that DeFCoM can detect footprints using ATAC-seq data with similar accuracy as when using DNase-seq data.Availability and Implementation:Python code available athttps://bitbucket.org/bryancquach/defcomContact:bquach@email.unc.eduortsfurey@email.unc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	9	1508	2028	1804	2128	1487	0.267692504274	0.267210754002	0.234034094563	0.189451567627	0.0829804821231	2.75397887458	0.513414537814	NULL	1.61298721954	-0.229572062375

However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories.Results:We presentswitchde, a statistical framework and accompanyingRpackage for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs.

1606	http://rcidm.org/rader/	1607	NULL	RADER	Summary:Evaluation of the capacity for separating actives from challenging decoys is a crucial metric of performance related to molecular docking or a virtual screening workflow. The Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) and its enhanced version (DUD-E) provide a benchmark for molecular docking, although they only contain a limited set of decoys for limited targets. DecoyFinder was released to compensate the limitations of DUD or DUD-E for building target-specific decoy sets. However, desirable query template design, generation of multiple decoy sets of similar quality, and computational speed remain bottlenecks, particularly when the numbers of queried actives and retrieved decoys increases to hundreds or more. Here, we developed a program suite called RApid DEcoy Retriever (RADER) to facilitate the decoy-based assessment of virtual screening. This program adopts a novel database-management regime that supports rapid and large-scale retrieval of decoys, enables high portability of databases, and provides multifaceted options for designing initial query templates from a large number of active ligands and generating subtle decoy sets. RADER provides two operational modes: as a command-line tool and on a web server. Validation of the performance and efficiency of RADER was also conducted and is described.Availability and Implementation:RADER web server and a local version are freely available athttp://rcidm.org/rader/.Contact:lingwang@scut.edu.cnorwent@scut.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1516	494	1611	1184	2287	0.523440969117	0.381924404219	0.125888496889	0.117042374118	-1.56839861773	-1.43412074925	3.75716597039	NULL	2.17059977603	-0.717404436958

Although large amount of phosphorylation sites have been detected, unfortunately, it is rarely known which kinases activate those sites. Despite distinct computational approaches have been proposed to predict the kinase–substrate interactions, the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved.Results:In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model named as PhosD to predict kinase–substrate relationships based on protein domains with the assumption that kinase–substrate interactions are accomplished with kinase–domain interactions. By further taking into account protein–protein interactions, our PhosD outperforms other popular approaches on several benchmark datasets with higher precision. In addition, some of our predicted kinase–substrate relationships are validated by signaling pathways, indicating the predictive power of our approach. Furthermore, we notice that given a kinase, the more substrates are known for the kinase the more accurate its predicted substrates will be, and the domains involved in kinase–substrate interactions are found to be more conserved across proteins phosphorylated by multiple kinases.

However, performing fast and accurate secondary structure comparisons is challenging when we take into account the RNA configuration (i.e. linear or circular), the presence of pseudoknot and G-quadruplex (G4) motifs and the increasing number of secondary structures generated by high-throughput probing techniques. To address this challenge, we propose the super-n-motifs model based on a latent analysis of enhanced motifs comprising not only basic motifs but also adjacency relations. The super-n-motifs model computes a vector representation of secondary structures as linear combinations of these motifs.Results:We demonstrate the accuracy of our model for comparison of secondary structures from linear and circular RNA while also considering pseudoknot and G4 motifs. We show that the super-n-motifs representation effectively captures the most important structural features of secondary structures, as compared to other representations such as ordered tree, arc-annotated and string representations.

General computational approaches that do not require the assumptions of classical theory are therefore quite desirable. One such general approach is provided by the theory of absorbing Markov chains, which can be used to obtain exact results by directly analyzing population genetic Markov models, such as the classic bi-allelic Wright–Fisher model. Although these approaches are sometimes used, they are usually forgone in favor of simulation methods, due to the perception that they are too computationally burdensome. Here we show that, surprisingly, direct analysis of virtually any Markov chain model in population genetics can be made quite efficient by exploiting transition matrix sparsity and by solving restricted systems of linear equations, allowing a wide variety of exact calculations (within machine precision) to be easily and rapidly made on modern workstation computers.Results:We introduce Wright–Fisher Exact Solver (WFES), a fast and scalable method for direct analysis of Markov chain models in population genetics. WFES can rapidly solve for both long-term and transient behaviours including fixation and extinction probabilities, expected times to fixation or extinction, sojourn times, expected allele age and variance, and others.

PCR assembly of DNA templates andin vitrotranscription allow synthesis and purification of hundreds of RNA mutants in a cost-effective manner, with sharing of primers across constructs allowing significant reductions in expense. However, these protocols require organization of primer locations across numerous 96 well plates and guidance for pipetting, non-trivial tasks for which informatics and visualization tools can prevent costly errors. We report here an online tool to accelerate synthesis of large libraries of desired mutants through design and efficient organization of primers. The underlying program and graphical interface have been experimentally tested in our laboratory for RNA domains with lengths up to 300 nucleotides and libraries encompassing up to 960 variants. In addition to the freely available Primerize-2D server, the primer design code is available as a stand-alone Python package for broader applications.Availability and Implementation:http://primerize2d.stanford.eduContact:rhiju@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1533	1912	405	359	44	0.290244289322	0.266176512142	0.229483015249	0.213318394349	0.328705675548	-3.78576122857	-0.815300360397	NULL	-1.32478553172	-1.11674735584

Its use in proteome annotation is however hampered by the availability of many methods with similar performance at the single residue level, which have mostly not been optimized to predict long ID regions of size comparable to domains.Results:Here, we have focused on providing a single consensus-based prediction, MobiDB-lite, optimized for highly specific (i.e. few false positive) predictions of long disorder. The method uses eight different predictors to derive a consensus which is then filtered for spurious short predictions. Consensus prediction is shown to outperform the single methods when annotating long ID regions.

Current loop modelling algorithms can mostly be divided into two categories: knowledge-based, where databases of fragments are searched to find suitable conformations andab initio, where conformations are generated computationally. Existing knowledge-based methods only use fragments that are the same length as the target, even though loops of slightly different lengths may adopt similar conformations. Here, we present a novel method, Sphinx, which combinesab initiotechniques with the potential extra structural information contained within loops of a different length to improve structure prediction.Results:We show that Sphinx is able to generate high-accuracy predictions and decoy sets enriched with near-native loop conformations, performing better than theab initioalgorithm on which it is based. In addition, it is able to provide predictions for every target, unlike some knowledge-based methods. Sphinx can be used successfully for the difficult problem of antibody H3 prediction, outperforming RosettaAntibody, one of the leading H3-specificab initiomethods, both in accuracy and speed.Availability and Implementation:Sphinx is available athttp://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sphinx.Contact:deane@stats.ox.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	8	1537	1598	3	1751	857	0.353352595846	0.18583014386	0.159033093344	0.146527512603	-1.04488711725	0.356120669079	3.48894530866	NULL	2.19893437931	-1.53125391398
1628	https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard	1629	NULL	ntCard	Motivation:Many bioinformatics algorithms are designed for the analysis of sequences of some uniform length, conventionally referred to ask-mers. These include de Bruijn graph assembly methods and sequence alignment tools. An efficient algorithm to enumerate the number of uniquek-mers, or even better, to build a histogram ofk-mer frequencies would be desirable for these tools and their downstream analysis pipelines. Among other applications, estimated frequencies can be used to predict genome sizes, measure sequencing error rates, and tune runtime parameters for analysis tools. However, calculating ak-mer histogram from large volumes of sequencing data is a challenging task.Results:Here, we present ntCard, a streaming algorithm for estimating the frequencies ofk-mers in genomics datasets. At its core, ntCard uses the ntHash algorithm to efficiently compute hash values for streamed sequences. It then samples the calculated hash values to build a reduced representation multiplicity table describing the sample distribution. Finally, it uses a statistical model to reconstruct the population distribution from the sample distribution. We have compared the performance of ntCard and other cardinality estimation algorithms. We used three datasets of 480 GB, 500 GB and 2.4 TB in size, where the first two representing whole genome shotgun sequencing experiments on the human genome and the last one on the white spruce genome. Results show ntCard estimatesk-mer coverage frequencies >15× faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, using similar amount of memory, and with higher accuracy rates. Thus, our benchmarks demonstrate ntCard as a potentially enabling technology for large-scale genomics applications.Availability and Implementation:ntCard is written in C ++ and is released under the GPL license.

Variant matching is complicated by variants that have multiple equivalent representations. Normalization and decomposition algorithms have been proposed, but are not robust to different representation of complex variants. Variant matching is also usually done to maximize the number of matches, as opposed to other optimization criteria.Results:We present the VarMatch algorithm for the variant matching problem. Our algorithm is based on a theoretical result which allows us to partition the input into smaller subproblems without sacrificing accuracy. VarMatch is robust to different representation of complex variants and is particularly effective in low complexity regions or those dense in variants. VarMatch is able to detect more matches than either the normalization or decomposition algorithms on tested datasets. It also implements different optimization criteria, such as edit distance, that can improve robustness to different variant representations.

Moreover, the development of these routines is not easy, both because of the diversity of these formats and the need for managing efficiently sequence datasets that may count up to billions of characters. We present FASTdoop, a generic Hadoop library for the management of FASTA and FASTQ files. We show that, with respect to analogous input management routines that have appeared in the Literature, it offers versatility and efficiency. That is, it can handle collections of reads, with or without quality scores, as well as long genomic sequences while the existing routines concentrate mainly on NGS sequence data. Moreover, in the domain where a comparison is possible, the routines proposed here are faster than the available ones.

Current annotation approaches report the impact of such variants in the context of altered DNA sequence only; attributes of the resulting transcript, reading frame and translated protein product are not reported. To remedy this shortcoming, we present a new genetic annotation approach termed Codon Consequence Scanner (COCOS). Implemented as an Ensembl variant effect predictor (VEP) plugin, COCOS captures amino acid sequence alterations stemming from variants that produce an altered reading frame, such as stop-lost variants and small insertions and deletions (InDels). To highlight its significance, COCOS was applied to data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Transcripts affected by stop-lost variants introduce a median of 15 amino acids, while InDels have a more extensive impact with a median of 66 amino acids being incorporated. Captured sequence alterations are written out in FASTA format and can be further analyzed for impact on the underlying protein structure.Availability and Implementation:COCOS is available to all users on github:https://github.com/butkiem/COCOSContact:mariusz.butkiewicz@case.edu	0.0	8	1546	1928	1451	1913	2195	0.207886912193	0.189288281878	0.183878201955	0.178317410208	1.36384757028	1.26172472367	-3.16553288779	NULL	-0.413121580716	-1.25536815368

To date, most network-assisted methods aim at finding genes connected in a background network, whatever the density or strength of their connections. This can hamper the findings as sparse connections are non-robust against noise from either the GWAS results or the network resource.Results: We present SigMod, a novel and efficient method integrating GWAS results and gene network to identify a strongly interconnected gene module enriched in high association signals. Our method is formulated as a binary quadratic optimization problem, which can be solved exactly through graph min-cut algorithms. Compared to existing methods, SigMod has several desirable properties: (i) edge weights quantifying confidence of connections between genes are taken into account, (ii) the selection path can be computed rapidly, (iii) the identified gene module is strongly interconnected, hence includes genes of high functional relevance, and (iv) the method is robust against noise from either the GWAS results or the network resource. We applied SigMod to both simulated and real data. It was found to outperform state-of-the-art network-assisted methods in identifying disease-associated genes. When SigMod was applied to childhood-onset asthma GWAS results, it successfully identified a gene module enriched in consistently high association signals and made of functionally related genes that are biologically relevant for asthma.Availability and implementation:An R package SigMod is available at:https://github.com/YuanlongLiu/SigModContact:yuanlong.liu@inserm.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	10	1548	2113	1639	1444	555	0.280024338515	0.231244939919	0.228682217648	0.218679450039	-1.30331984433	0.852645027436	-2.53188786158	NULL	0.534190246676	2.20633682555

Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results:The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls.

Data analysis workflows typically don’t access the full breadth of information about instrument precision and accuracy that is present in each peptide isotopic envelope measurement. This method utilizes both isotope distribution and changes in neutromer spacing, which benefits the analysis of both concentration and turnover.Results:We have developed a data analysis tool, DeuteRater, to measure protein turnover from metabolic D2O labeling. DeuteRater uses theoretical predictions for label-dependent change in isotope abundance and inter-peak (neutromer) spacing within the isotope envelope to calculate protein turnover rate. We have also used these metrics to evaluate the accuracy and precision of peptide measurements and thereby determined the optimal data acquisition parameters of different instruments, as well as the effect of data processing steps. We show that these combined measurements can be used to remove noise and increase confidence in the protein turnover measurement for each protein.Availability and Implementation:Source code and ReadMe for Python 2 and 3 versions of DeuteRater are available athttps://github.com/JC-Price/DeuteRater.

We currently lack tools that efficiently and accurately align DNA reads against protein references, the technique necessary for constructing a functional profile. Here, we present PALADIN—a novel modification of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner that provides accurate alignment, robust reporting capabilities and orders-of-magnitude improved efficiency by directly mapping in protein space.Results:We compared the accuracy and efficiency of PALADIN against existing tools that employ nucleotide or protein alignment algorithms. Using simulated reads, PALADIN consistently outperformed the popular DNA read mappers BWA and NovoAlign in detected proteins, percentage of reads mapped and ontological similarity. We also compared PALADIN against four existing protein alignment tools: BLASTX, RAPSearch2, DIAMOND and Lambda, using empirically obtained reads. PALADIN yielded results seven times faster than the best performing alternative, DIAMOND and nearly 8000 times faster than BLASTX.

1642	https://github.com/tparidae/AFresh	1643	NULL	AFRESh	Motivation:The past decade has seen the introduction of new technologies that lowered the cost of genomic sequencing increasingly. We can even observe that the cost of sequencing is dropping significantly faster than the cost of storage and transmission. The latter motivates a need for continuous improvements in the area of genomic data compression, not only at the level of effectiveness (compression rate), but also at the level of functionality (e.g. random access), configurability (effectiveness versus complexity, coding tool set …) and versatility (support for both sequenced reads and assembled sequences). In that regard, we can point out that current approaches mostly do not support random access, requiring full files to be transmitted, and that current approaches are restricted to either read or sequence compression.Results:We propose AFRESh, an adaptive framework for no-reference compression of genomic data with random access functionality, targeting the effective representation of the raw genomic symbol streams of both reads and assembled sequences. AFRESh makes use of a configurable set of prediction and encoding tools, extended by a Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding scheme (CABAC), to compress raw genetic codes. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to describe an effective implementation CABAC outside of its’ original application. By applying CABAC, the compression effectiveness improves by up to 19% for assembled sequences and up to 62% for reads. By applying AFRESh to the genomic symbols of the MPEG genomic compression test set for reads, a compression gain is achieved of up to 51% compared to SCALCE, 42% compared to LFQC and 44% compared to ORCOM. When comparing to generic compression approaches, a compression gain is achieved of up to 41% compared to GNU Gzip and 22% compared to 7-Zip at the Ultra setting. Additionaly, when compressing assembled sequences of the Human Genome, a compression gain is achieved up to 34% compared to GNU Gzip and 16% compared to 7-Zip at the Ultra setting.Availability and Implementation:A Windows executable version can be downloaded athttps://github.com/tparidae/AFresh.Contact:tom.paridaens@ugent.be	0.0	6	1552	620	1412	2081	1834	0.408078067541	0.391134834688	0.375341204413	0.278745101606	3.53661968427	-1.60764916439	-0.514537317715	NULL	-1.17136772974	-2.22968028727

1650	https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits	1651	NULL	NGS	Summary:Quality control (QC) is an important part of all NGS data analysis stages. Many available tools calculate QC metrics from different analysis steps of single sample experiments (raw reads, mapped reads and variant lists). Multi-sample experiments, as sequencing of tumor-normal pairs, require additional QC metrics to ensure validity of results. These multi-sample QC metrics still lack standardization. We therefore suggest a new workflow for QC of DNA sequencing of tumor-normal pairs. With this workflow well-known single-sample QC metrics and additional metrics specific for tumor-normal pairs can be calculated. The segmentation into different tools offers a high flexibility and allows reuse for other purposes. All tools produce qcML, a generic XML format for QC of -omics experiments. qcML uses quality metrics defined in an ontology, which was adapted for NGS.Availability and Implementation:All QC tools are implemented in C ++ and run both under Linux and Windows.

1651	https://github.com/zhangjiaobxy/nssrfBinary	1652	[1873, 1763, 2558]	NSSRF	Motivation:The exponential growth of biological network database has increasingly rendered the global network similarity search (NSS) computationally intensive. Given a query network and a network database, it aims to find out the top similar networks in the database against the query network based on a topological similarity measure of interest. With the advent of big network data, the existing search methods may become unsuitable since some of them could render queries unsuccessful by returning empty answers or arbitrary query restrictions. Therefore, the design of NSS algorithm remains challenging under the dilemma between accuracy and efficiency.Results:We propose a global NSS method based on regression, denotated as NSSRF, which boosts the search speed without any significant sacrifice in practical performance. As motivated from the nature, subgraph signatures are heavily involved. Two phases are proposed in NSSRF: offline model building phase and similarity query phase. In the offline model building phase, the subgraph signatures and cosine similarity scores are used for efficient random forest regression (RFR) model training. In the similarity query phase, the trained regression model is queried to return similar networks. We have extensively validated NSSRF on biological pathways and molecular structures; NSSRF demonstrates competitive performance over the state-of-the-arts. Remarkably, NSSRF works especially well for large networks, which indicates that the proposed approach can be promising in the era of big data. Case studies have proven the efficiencies and uniqueness of NSSRF which could be missed by the existing state-of-the-arts.Availability and Implementation:The source code of two versions of NSSRF are freely available for downloading athttps://github.com/zhangjiaobxy/nssrfBinaryandhttps://github.com/zhangjiaobxy/nssrfPackage.Contact:kc.w@cityu.edu.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	7	1561	682	540	1777	2342	0.346614998666	0.279586004474	0.256576678935	0.191364180376	1.5844034852	0.468856129369	2.59212503002	NULL	0.694640423386	2.95207953092

1663	https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/mgribsko/aptrank	1664	NULL	AptRank	Motivation:Diffusion-based network models are widely used for protein function prediction using protein network data and have been shown to outperform neighborhood-based and module-based methods. Recent studies have shown that integrating the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology (GO) data dramatically improves prediction accuracy. However, previous methods usually either used the GO hierarchy to refine the prediction results of multiple classifiers, or flattened the hierarchy into a function–function similarity kernel. No study has taken the GO hierarchy into account together with the protein network as a two-layer network model.Results:We first construct a Bi-relational graph (Birg) model comprised of both protein–protein association and function–function hierarchical networks. We then propose two diffusion-based methods, BirgRank and AptRank, both of which use PageRank to diffuse information on this two-layer graph model. BirgRank is a direct application of traditional PageRank with fixed decay parameters. In contrast, AptRank utilizes an adaptive diffusion mechanism to improve the performance of BirgRank. We evaluate the ability of both methods to predict protein function on yeast, fly and human protein datasets, and compare with four previous methods: GeneMANIA, TMC, ProteinRank and clusDCA. We design four different validation strategies: missing function prediction,de novofunction prediction, guided function prediction and newly discovered function prediction to comprehensively evaluate predictability of all six methods. We find that both BirgRank and AptRank outperform the previous methods, especially in missing function prediction when using only 10% of the data for training.Availability and Implementation:The MATLAB code is available athttps://github.rcac.purdue.edu/mgribsko/aptrank.Contact:gribskov@purdue.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	8	1573	1068	1700	2275	1361	0.251762813807	0.205948308033	0.194881019532	0.194278728376	-1.49305027403	0.768391936381	2.10044183894	NULL	2.19642720994	0.963969595021
1664	https://github.com/yufengwudcs/STELLS2	1665	NULL	STELLS2	Motivation:It is well known that gene trees and species trees may have different topologies. One explanation is incomplete lineage sorting, which is commonly modeled by the coalescent process. In multispecies coalescent, a gene tree topology is observed with some probability (called the gene tree probability) for a given species tree. Gene tree probability is the main tool for the program STELLS, which finds the maximum likelihood estimate of the species tree from the given gene tree topologies. However, STELLS becomes slow when data size increases. Recently, several fast species tree inference methods have been developed, which can handle large data. However, these methods often do not fully utilize the information in the gene trees.Results:In this paper, we present an algorithm (called STELLS2) for computing the gene tree probability more efficiently than the original STELLS. The key idea of STELLS2 is taking some ‘shortcuts’ during the computation and computing the gene tree probability approximately. We apply the STELLS2 algorithm in the species tree inference approach in the original STELLS, which leads to a new maximum likelihood species tree inference method (also called STELLS2). Through simulation we demonstrate that the gene tree probabilities computed by STELLS2 and STELLS have strong correlation. We show that STELLS2 is almost as accurate in species tree inference as STELLS. Also STELLS2 is usually more accurate than several existing methods when there is one allele per species, although STELLS2 is slower than these methods. STELLS2 outperforms these methods significantly when there are multiple alleles per species.Availability and Implementation:The program STELLS2 is available for download at:https://github.com/yufengwudcs/STELLS2Contact:yufeng.wu@uconn.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1574	2161	239	2264	1026	0.323164839396	0.258415663613	0.256289156527	0.245442055049	2.72285834001	1.81550771174	-0.0944144659115	NULL	0.899870423184	-0.21654256397
1665	https://github.com/bcgsc/kollector	1666	NULL	Kollector	Motivation:Despite considerable advancements in sequencing and computing technologies,de novoassembly of whole eukaryotic genomes is still a time-consuming task that requires a significant amount of computational resources and expertise. A targeted assembly approach to perform local assembly of sequences of interest remains a valuable option for some applications. This is especially true for gene-centric assemblies, whose resulting sequence can be readily utilized for more focused biological research. Here we describe Kollector, an alignment-free targeted assembly pipeline that uses thousands of transcript sequences concurrently to inform the localized assembly of corresponding gene loci. Kollector robustly reconstructs introns and novel sequences within these loci, and scales well to large genomes—properties that makes it especially useful for researchers working on non-model eukaryotic organisms.Results:We demonstrate the performance of Kollector for assembling complete or near-completeCaenorhabditis elegansandHomo sapiensgene loci from their respective, input transcripts. In a time- and memory-efficient manner, the Kollector pipeline successfully reconstructs respectively 99% and 80% (compared to 86% and 73% with standardde novoassembly techniques) ofC.elegansandH.sapienstranscript targets in their corresponding genomic space using whole genome shotgun sequencing reads. We also show that Kollector outperforms both established and recently released targeted assembly tools. Finally, we demonstrate three use cases for Kollector, including comparative and cancer genomics applications.Availability and Implementation:Kollector is implemented as a bash script, and is available athttps://github.com/bcgsc/kollectorContact:ibirol@bcgsc.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	9	1575	1276	1450	1827	1397	0.179855684646	0.178635394813	0.161720196097	0.150162094194	3.09704946211	-1.14573805644	-1.49921446851	NULL	-0.119276868959	-2.996015754
1666	http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick/snp	1667	NULL	PhosphoPICK-SNP	Motivation:Genome-wide association studies are identifying single nucleotide variants (SNVs) linked to various diseases, however the functional effect caused by these variants is often unknown. One potential functional effect, the loss or gain of protein phosphorylation sites, can be induced through variations in key amino acids that disrupt or introduce valid kinase binding patterns. Current methods for predicting the effect of SNVs on phosphorylation operate on the sequence content of reference and variant proteins. However, consideration of the amino acid sequence alone is insufficient for predicting phosphorylation change, as context factors determine kinase-substrate selection.Results:We present here a method for quantifying the effect of SNVs on protein phosphorylation through an integrated system of motif analysis and context-based assessment of kinase targets. By predicting the effect that known variants across the proteome have on phosphorylation, we are able to use this background of proteome-wide variant effects to quantify the significance of novel variants for modifying phosphorylation. We validate our method on a manually curated set of phosphorylation change-causing variants from the primary literature, showing that the method predicts known examples of phosphorylation change at high levels of specificity. We apply our approach to data-sets of variants in phosphorylation site regions, showing that variants causing predicted phosphorylation loss are over-represented among disease-associated variants.Availability and Implementation:The method is freely available as a web-service at the websitehttp://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick/snpContact:m.boden@uq.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1576	2273	144	1318	500	0.507134870818	0.375861497017	0.32304145381	0.30526069193	0.50886376154	2.55336634413	2.47639635001	NULL	2.92382596113	0.372823944058
1667	https://github.com/HAShihab/HIPred	1668	NULL	HIPred	Motivation:A major cause of autosomal dominant disease is haploinsufficiency, whereby a single copy of a gene is not sufficient to maintain the normal function of the gene. A large proportion of existing methods for predicting haploinsufficiency incorporate biological networks, e.g. protein-protein interaction networks that have recently been shown to introduce study bias. As a result, these methods tend to perform best on well-studied genes, but underperform on less studied genes. The advent of large genome sequencing consortia, such as the 1000 genomes project, NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium creates an urgent need for unbiased haploinsufficiency prediction methods.Results:Here, we describe a machine learning approach, called HIPred, that integrates genomic and evolutionary information from ENSEMBL, with functional annotations from the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements consortium and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project to predict haploinsufficiency, without the study bias described earlier.

However, when analyzing these data, scientists are often left holding disparate biological currency—molecular identifiers from different databases.

Illumina has developed an integrated software for SNP data visualization and inspection called GenomeStudio® (GS). ASSIsT builds on GS-derived data and identifies those markers that follow a bi-allelic genetic model and show reliable genotype calls. Moreover, ASSIsT re-edits SNP calls with null alleles or additional SNPs in the probe annealing site. ASSIsT can be employed in the analysis of different population types such as full-sib families and mating schemes used in the plant kingdom (backcross, F1, F2), and unrelated individuals. The final result can be directly exported in the format required by the most common software for genetic mapping and marker–trait association analysis.

In this way, OVA combines information regarding molecular and physical phenotypes and integrates both human and model organism data to effectively prioritize variants.

Compared to the most recently available methods, LoopIng is able to achieve similar accuracy for short loops (4–10 residues) and significant enhancements for long loops (11–20 residues). The quality of the predictions is robust to errors that unavoidably affect the stem regions when these are modeled.

Existing methods for comparative motif discovery usually rely on pregenerated multiple sequence alignments, which are difficult to obtain for more diverged species such as plants. As a consequence, misaligned regulatory elements often remain undetected.Results:We present a novel algorithm that supports both alignment-free and alignment-based motif discovery in the promoter sequences of related species. Putative motifs are exhaustively enumerated as words over the IUPAC alphabet and screened for conservation using the branch length score. Additionally, a confidence score is established in a genome-wide fashion. In order to take advantage of a cloud computing infrastructure, the MapReduce programming model is adopted. The method is applied to four monocotyledon plant species and it is shown that high-scoring motifs are significantly enriched for open chromatin regions inOryza sativaand for transcription factor binding sites inferred through protein-binding microarrays inO.sativaandZea mays.Furthermore, the method is shown to recover experimentally profiled ga2ox1-like KN1 binding sites inZ.mays.Availability and implementation:BLSSpeller was written in Java.

High-resolution general-purpose TSS prediction remains a challenging problem, with little recent progress on the identification and differentiation of TSSs which are arranged in different spatial patterns along the chromosome.Results:In this work, we present the Transcription Initiation Pattern Recognizer (TIPR), a sequence-based machine learning model that identifies TSSs with high accuracy and resolution for multiple spatial distribution patterns along the genome, including broadly distributed TSS patterns that have previously been difficult to characterize. TIPR predicts not only the locations of TSSs but also the expected spatial initiation pattern each TSS will form along the chromosome—a novel capability for TSS prediction algorithms. As spatial initiation patterns are associated with spatiotemporal expression patterns and gene function, this capability has the potential to improve gene annotations and our understanding of the regulation of transcription initiation. The high nucleotide resolution of this model locates TSSs within 10 nucleotides or less on average.Availability and implementation:Model source code is made available online athttp://megraw.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/software/TIPR/.Contact:megrawm@science.oregonstate.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1604	2419	2445	234	757	0.389201409713	0.244149543903	0.183080527952	0.151833712752	1.2887500556	1.39036724525	-1.18040010294	NULL	-0.542548538111	0.0683798302238

However, due to the inherent complexity of phosphorylation patterns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are related to functions, it is often not possible to directly deduce protein activities from those measurements. Here, we present a heuristic machine learning algorithm that infers the activities of kinases from Phosphoproteomics data using kinase–target information from the PhosphoSitePlus database. By comparing the estimated kinase activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles, it is furthermore possible to derive the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate the respective phosphosite.Results:We apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell cycle generated from HeLaS3 cells, and insulin signalling dynamics in mouse hepatocytes. In the first case, we estimate the activities of 118 at six cell cycle stages and derive 94 new kinase–phosphosite links that can be validated through either database or motif information. In the second case, the activities of 143 kinases at eight time points are estimated and 49 new kinase–target links are derived.Availability and implementation:The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and be downloaded from github.

However, almost all the decoy sets currently used in literature suffer from uneven root mean square deviation (RMSD) distribution with bias to non-protein like hydrogen-bonding and compactness patterns. Meanwhile, most protein decoy sets are pre-calculated and there is a lack of methods for automated generation of high-quality decoys for any target proteins.Results:We developed a new algorithm, 3DRobot, to create protein structure decoys by free fragment assembly with enhanced hydrogen-bonding and compactness interactions. The method was benchmarked with three widely used decoy sets fromab initiofolding and comparative modeling simulations. The decoys generated by 3DRobot are shown to have significantly enhanced diversity and evenness with a continuous distribution in the RMSD space. The new energy terms introduced in 3DRobot improve the hydrogen-bonding network and compactness of decoys, which eliminates the possibility of native structure recognition by trivial potentials. Algorithms that can automatically create such diverse and well-packed non-native conformations from any protein structure should have a broad impact on the development of advanced protein force field and folding simulation methods.Availiablity and implementation:http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/Contact:jiay@phy.ccnu.edu.cn;zhng@umich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1611	1516	494	1393	1537	0.381924404219	0.345969252515	0.143091927531	0.142533568587	-1.57242581473	-1.40024007414	3.75126519123	NULL	2.25184977218	-0.822788818577

They can be bound with proteins (activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a critical role in promoting gene transcription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is a challenging task to develop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely complicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, they were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an enhancer or not. According to the distinct levels of biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes, however, enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength.Results:In view of this, a two-layer predictor called ‘iEnhancer-2L’ was proposed by formulating DNA elements with the ‘pseudok-tuple nucleotide composition’, into which the six DNA local parameters were incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated thatiEnhancer-2Lholds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis.Availability and implementation:For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for the two-layer predictor was established athttp://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.Contact:bliu@gordonlifescience.org,bliu@insun.hit.edu.cn,xlan@stanford.edu,kcchou@gordonlifescience.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	22.0	5	1612	1171	1427	1805	1891	0.394689588895	0.301706565863	0.29047456212	0.229242860851	2.9697472477	0.499567176074	0.275462188513	NULL	2.33453865049	0.308859205973

Subsequently, gene statistics are constructed using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns from a relevant reference panel. However, all methods, including our own Joint Effect on Phenotype of eQTL/functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a Gene (JEPEG), assume homogeneous panels, e.g. European. However, this renders these tools unsuitable for the analysis of large cosmopolitan cohorts.Results:We propose a JEPEG extension, JEPEGMIX, which similar to one of our software tools, Direct Imputation of summary STatistics of unmeasured SNPs from MIXed ethnicity cohorts, is capable of estimating accurate LD patterns for cosmopolitan cohorts. JEPEGMIX uses this accurate LD estimates to (i) impute the summary statistics at unmeasured functional variants and (ii) test for the joint effect of all measured and imputed functional variants which are associated with a gene.

Xtalkcomputes the statistical significance of the average length of multiple short paths that connect receptors in one pathway to the transcription factors in another. By design, Xtalkreports the precise interactions and mechanisms that support the identified crosstalk. We applied Xtalkto signaling pathways in the KEGG and NCI-PID databases. We manually curated a gold standard set of 132 crosstalking pathway pairs and a set of 140 pairs that did not crosstalk, for which Xtalkachieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.65, a 12% improvement over the closest competing approach. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve varied with the pathway, suggesting that crosstalk should be evaluated on a pathway-by-pathway level. We also analyzed an extended set of 658 pathway pairs in KEGG and to a set of more than 7000 pathway pairs in NCI-PID.

Human genome data contain valuable but highly sensitive information. Unprotected disclosure of such information might put individual’s privacy at risk. It is important to protect human genome data. Exact logistic regression is a bias-reduction method based on a penalized likelihood to discover rare variants that are associated with disease susceptibility. We propose the HEALER framework to facilitate secure rare variants analysis with a small sample size.Results:We target at the algorithm design aiming at reducing the computational and storage costs to learn a homomorphic exact logistic regression model (i.e. evaluateP-values of coefficients), where the circuit depth is proportional to the logarithmic scale of data size.

Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.Results:Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles.

These are now typed as reaction-like commands in ASCII text files that are read by Pycellerator, which includes a Python command line interface (CLI), a Python application programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface.Results:Cellerator reaction arrows are now input in text files. The arrows are parsed by Pycellerator and translated into differential equations in Python, and Python code is automatically generated to solve the system.

Yet, comparatively few efforts have been made to tailor their topology to the actual cellular condition being studied. Here, we present a network construction method that exploits expression data at the transcript-level and thus reveals alterations in protein connectivity not only caused by differential gene expression but also by alternative splicing. We achieved this by establishing a direct correspondence between individual protein interactions and underlying domain interactions in a complete but condition-unspecific protein interaction network. This knowledge was then used to infer the condition-specific presence of interactions from the dominant protein isoforms. When we compared contextualized interaction networks of matched normal and tumor samples in breast cancer, our transcript-based construction identified more significant alterations that affected proteins associated with cancerogenesis than a method that only uses gene expression data.

1730	http://www.cbio.uct.ac.za/ancGWAS	1731	NULL	ancGWAS	Motivation:Despite numerous successful Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS), detecting variants that have low disease risk still poses a challenge. GWAS may miss disease genes with weak genetic effects or strong epistatic effects due to the single-marker testing approach commonly used. GWAS may thus generate false negative or inconclusive results, suggesting the need for novel methods to combine effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms within a gene to increase the likelihood of fully characterizing the susceptibility gene.Results:We developed ancGWAS, an algebraic graph-based centrality measure that accounts for linkage disequilibrium in identifying significant disease sub-networks by integrating the association signal from GWAS data sets into the human protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. We validated ancGWAS using an association study result from a breast cancer data set and the simulation of interactive disease loci in the simulation of a complex admixed population, as well as pathway-based GWAS simulation. This new approach holds promise for deconvoluting the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Results obtained yield a novel central breast cancer sub-network of the human interactome implicated in theproteoglycan syndecan-mediated signaling events pathway which isknown to play a major role in mesenchymal tumor cell proliferation, thus providing further insights into breast cancer pathogenesis.Availability and implementation:The ancGWAS package and documents are available athttp://www.cbio.uct.ac.za/~emile/software.htmlContact:emile.chimusa@uct.ac.za,Nicola.Mulder@uct.ac.zaSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1639	2113	1548	2241	1682	0.290503273347	0.231244939919	0.229887478604	0.225928742042	-1.35423394891	0.943775524932	-2.77609632626	NULL	0.689484920727	1.92636252137
1731	http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoWAP	1732	NULL	GenoWAP	Motivation:Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a great success in the past decade. However, significant challenges still remain in both identifying new risk loci and interpreting results. Bonferroni-corrected significance level is known to be conservative, leading to insufficient statistical power when the effect size is moderate at risk locus. Complex structure of linkage disequilibrium also makes it challenging to separate causal variants from nonfunctional ones in large haplotype blocks. Under such circumstances, a computational approach that may increase signal replication rate and identify potential functional sites among correlated markers is urgently needed.Results:We describe GenoWAP, a GWAS signal prioritization method that integrates genomic functional annotation and GWAS test statistics. The effectiveness of GenoWAP is demonstrated through its applications to Crohn’s disease and schizophrenia using the largest studies available, where highly ranked loci show substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after prioritization based on a subset of samples. At the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, top ranked SNPs after prioritization have both higher replication rates and consistently stronger enrichment of eQTLs. Within each risk locus, GenoWAP may be able to distinguish functional sites from groups of correlated SNPs.Availability and implementation:GenoWAP is freely available on the web athttp://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoWAPContact:hongyu.zhao@yale.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1640	2113	1902	938	1639	0.27390552139	0.21583870714	0.215160980173	0.211851453469	-1.32567551843	1.10995493137	-2.82842253814	NULL	0.914054649093	1.8104542797

Differential expression analysis has long been used for this purpose; however, conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within class heterogeneity.Results:To address this challenge, we developed EMDomics, a new method that uses the Earth mover’s distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a gene’s expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtainq-values for each gene. We applied EMDomics to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We also used simulated data to evaluate the performance of EMDomics, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying differentially expressed gene in classes with high within class heterogeneity. In both the simulated and real biological data, EMDomics outperformed competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes, and EMDomics was significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug resistance-associated gene sets. EMDomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide range of complex biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity.Availability and implementation:The R package is available athttp://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EMDomics.htmlContact:abeck2@bidmc.harvard.eduSupplementary information:supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1641	1104	1140	1993	1747	0.17461527842	0.156952100012	0.149311471307	0.143446476908	-0.955298477779	-0.0417583195646	-1.03408461721	NULL	-2.08470407524	0.387265768236

One such receptor is the MHC class I molecule. The length preferences vary depending on the MHC allele, but are generally limited to peptides of length 8–11 amino acids. On this relatively simple system, we developed a sequence alignment method based on artificial neural networks that allows insertions and deletions in the alignment.Results:We show that prediction methods based on alignments that include insertions and deletions have significantly higher performance than methods trained on peptides of single lengths. Also, we illustrate how the location of deletions can aid the interpretation of the modes of binding of the peptide-MHC, as in the case of long peptides bulging out of the MHC groove or protruding at either terminus. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can learn the length profile of different MHC molecules, and quantified the reduction of the experimental effort required to identify potential epitopes using our prediction algorithm.Availability and implementation:The NetMHC-4.0 method for the prediction of peptide-MHC class I binding affinity using gapped sequence alignment is publicly available at:http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC-4.0.Contact:mniel@cbs.dtu.dkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	9.0	6	1642	150	1971	1819	742	0.415359496571	0.371819912773	0.215422266063	0.206424645088	-3.14699022255	-0.194974992039	1.98192876198	NULL	2.52126897942	1.27077553854
1734	http://gerv.csail.mit.edu/	1735	[518]	GERV	Motivation:The majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies reside in noncoding regions of the genome with regulatory roles. Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of genome-wide association studies.Results:We present GERV (generative evaluation of regulatory variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer-based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factor’s canonical motif and associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis.Availability and implementation:The implementation of GERV and related data are available athttp://gerv.csail.mit.edu/.Contact:gifford@mit.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1643	2233	1576	2011	2128	0.208426933374	0.198065291181	0.195470423068	0.194793822029	0.706509742997	1.74008083762	-2.96806027425	NULL	0.157504005844	0.120095345751

We leverage recent advances in branching-process theory to develop a flexible Bayesian framework for specifying diversification models—where rates are constant, vary continuously, or change episodically through time—and implement numerical methods to estimate parameters of these models from molecular phylogenies, even when species sampling is incomplete. We enable both statistical inference and efficient simulation under these models.

High-throughput sequencing of RNA treated with bisulfite (RNA-BSseq) or subjected to enrichment techniques like Aza-IP or miCLIP enables transcriptome wide studies of this particular modification at single base pair resolution. However, to date, there are no specialized software tools available for the analysis of RNA-BSseq or Aza-IP data. Therefore, we developed meRanTK, the first publicly available tool kit which addresses the special demands of high-throughput RNA cytosine methylation data analysis. It provides fast and easy to use splice-aware bisulfite sequencing read mapping, comprehensive methylation calling and identification of differentially methylated cytosines by statistical analysis of single- and multi-replicate experiments.

Breaking ties between equally well mapping locations poses a severe problem not only during the alignment phase but also has significant impact on the results of downstream analyses. We present the multi-mapper resolution (MMR) tool that infers optimal mapping locations from the coverage density of other mapped reads.Results:Filtering alignments withMMRcan significantly improve the performance of downstream analyses like transcript quantitation and differential testing. We illustrate that the accuracy (Spearman correlation) of transcript quantification increases by 15% when using reads of length 51. In addition,MMRdecreases the alignment file sizes by more than 50%, and this leads to a reduced running time of the quantification tool. Our efficient implementation of theMMRalgorithm is easily applicable as a post-processing step to existing alignment files in BAM format. Its complexity scales linearly with the number of alignments and requires no further inputs.Availability and implementation:Open source code and documentation are available for download athttp://github.com/ratschlab/mmr.

The task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that would reach state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of species. GeneMark-ET is a gene prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into unsupervised training and subsequently generatesab initiogene predictions. AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses information from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary strengths of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool for automatic gene prediction.Results:We present BRAKER1, a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input, BRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file inbam-format with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and prediction.

DBSCAN, however, is slow, scaling with the number of localizations likeO(nlog (n)) at best, and it’s performance is highly dependent upon a subjectively selected choice of parameters.Results:We have developed a grid-based clustering algorithm FOCAL, which explicitly accounts for several dominant artifacts arising in SMLM image reconstructions. FOCAL is fast and efficient, scaling likeO(n), and only has one set parameter. We assess DBSCAN and FOCAL on experimental dSTORM data of clusters of eukaryotic RNAP II and PALM data of the bacterial protein H-NS, then provide a detailed comparison via simulation. FOCAL performs comparable and often superior to DBSCAN while yielding a significantly faster analysis.

Several methods for detecting structural variants with whole genome sequencing data have been developed. So far, none of these methods has combined information about abnormally mapped read pairs connecting rearranged regions and associated global copy number changes automatically inferred from the same sequencing data file. Our aim was to create a computational method that could use both types of information, i.e. normal and abnormal reads, and demonstrate that by doing so we can highly improve both sensitivity and specificity rates of structural variant prediction.Results:We developed a computational method, SV-Bay, to detect structural variants from whole genome sequencing mate-pair or paired-end data using a probabilistic Bayesian approach. This approach takes into account depth of coverage by normal reads and abnormalities in read pair mappings. To estimate the model likelihood, SV-Bay considers GC-content and read mappability of the genome, thus making important corrections to the expected read count. For the detection of somatic variants, SV-Bay makes use of a matched normal sample when it is available. We validated SV-Bay on simulated datasets and an experimental mate-pair dataset for the CLB-GA neuroblastoma cell line. The comparison of SV-Bay with several other methods for structural variant detection demonstrated that SV-Bay has better prediction accuracy both in terms of sensitivity and false-positive detection rate.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/InstitutCurie/SV-BayContact:valentina.boeva@inserm.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1671	1898	2006	1872	1167	0.314594294493	0.284964693869	0.263976246512	0.263310890724	1.87934486523	-0.68002795804	-3.40666885313	NULL	-0.0997278325468	-2.92217726602

The method deliberately inserts T-to-C substitutions at the RNA-protein interaction sites, which provides a second layer of evidence compared with other CLIP methods. However, the experiment includes several sources of noise which cause both low-frequency errors and spurious high-frequency alterations. Therefore, rigorous statistical analysis is required in order to separate true T-to-C base changes, following cross-linking, from noise. So far, most of the existing PAR-CLIP data analysis methods focus on discarding the low-frequency errors and rely on high-frequency substitutions to report binding sites, not taking into account the possibility of high-frequency false positive substitutions.Results: Here, we introduceBMix, a new probabilistic method which explicitly accounts for the sources of noise in PAR-CLIP data and distinguishes cross-link induced T-to-C substitutions from low and high-frequency erroneous alterations.

Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs.

1781	http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/Fuse/	1782	NULL	Fuse	Motivation:Discovering patterns in networks of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is a central problem in systems biology. Alignments between these networks aid functional understanding as they uncover important information, such as evolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs. However, the complexity of the multiple network alignment problem grows exponentially with the number of networks being aligned and designing a multiple network aligner that is both scalable and that produces biologically relevant alignments is a challenging task that has not been fully addressed. The objective of multiple network alignment is to create clusters of nodes that are evolutionarily and functionally conserved across all networks. Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not meet this objective as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize the entire functional and evolutionary information across all networks.Results:To overcome this weakness, we propose Fuse, a new multiple network alignment algorithm that works in two steps. First, it computes our novel protein functional similarity scores by fusing information from wiring patterns ofallaligned PPI networks and sequence similarities between their proteins. This is in contrast with the previous tools that are all based on protein similarities inpairsof networks being aligned. Our comprehensive new protein similarity scores are computed by Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) method that predicts associations between proteins whose homology (from sequences)andfunctioning similarity (from wiring patterns) are supported byallnetworks. Using the five largest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF predicts a large number protein pairs that are biologically consistent. Second, to identify clusters of aligned proteins over all networks, Fuse uses our novel maximum weightk-partite matching approximation algorithm. We compare Fuse with the state of the art multiple network aligners and show that (i) by using only sequence alignment scores, Fuse already outperforms other aligners and produces a larger number of biologically consistent clusters that cover all aligned PPI networks and (ii) using both sequence alignments and topological NMTF-predicted scores leads to the best multiple network alignments thus far.Availability and implementation:Our dataset and software are freely available from the web site:http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/Fuse/.Contact:natasha@imperial.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1689	682	1970	2162	1826	0.3965705403	0.390009234807	0.332955880843	0.322486123666	1.28669275269	0.439034684386	2.69629044718	NULL	1.18854218176	2.6196370122

Three major problems arise: the lack of known PPIs for that virus to learn from, the cost of learning about its proteins and the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods inapplicable or inefficient. We develop DeNovo, a sequence-based negative sampling and machine learning framework that learns from PPIs of different viruses to predict for a novel one, exploiting the shared host proteins. We tested DeNovo on PPIs from different domains to assess generalization.Results:By solving the challenge of generating less noisy negative interactions, DeNovo achieved accuracy up to 81 and 86% when predicting PPIs of viral proteins that have no and distant sequence similarity to the ones used for training, receptively. This result is comparable to the best achieved in single virus-host and intra-species PPI prediction cases. Thus, we can now predict PPIs for virtually any virus infecting human. DeNovo generalizes well; it achieved near optimal accuracy when tested on bacteria–human interactions.Availability and implementation:Code, data and additional supplementary materials needed to reproduce this study are available at:https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~alzahraa/denovo.Contact:alzahraa@vt.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1691	1987	1917	2077	406	0.210002327727	0.198492670247	0.185895683955	0.150939316472	-2.94019029529	1.58449905933	0.863693584503	NULL	2.14180246091	-0.376290722958

Unlike other tools based on protein similarity, CASSIS exploits the idea of co-regulation of the cluster genes, which assumes the existence of common regulatory patterns in the cluster promoters.

Gene-level association tests are often performed to analyze rare variants, where multiple rare variants in a gene region are analyzed jointly. Applying gene-level association tests to analyze sequence data often requires integrating multiple heterogeneous sources of information (e.g. annotations, functional prediction scores, allele frequencies, genotypes and phenotypes) to determine the optimal analysis unit and prioritize causal variants. Given the complexity and scale of current sequence datasets and bioinformatics databases, there is a compelling need for more efficient software tools to facilitate these analyses. To answer this challenge, we developed RVTESTS, which implements a broad set of rare variant association statistics and supports the analysis of autosomal and X-linked variants for both unrelated and related individuals. RVTESTS also provides useful companion features for annotating sequence variants, integrating bioinformatics databases, performing data quality control and sample selection. We illustrate the advantages of RVTESTS in functionality and efficiency using the 1000 Genomes Project data.Availability and implementation:RVTESTS is available on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Compared to current standard REML software based on the mixed model equation, our method is substantially faster. The advantage is largest when there is only a single genetic covariance structure. The method is particularly useful for multivariate analysis, including multi-trait models and random regression models for studying reaction norms. We applied our proposed method to publicly available mice and human data and discuss the advantages and limitations.Availability and implementation:MTG2 is available inhttps://sites.google.com/site/honglee0707/mtg2.Contact:hong.lee@une.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	7	1697	2201	1100	1437	2259	0.213615623018	0.177136169996	0.171520996525	0.169246233035	-1.17787073113	0.947834617066	-2.85945181394	NULL	0.8874901675	1.44262198633

They can be divided into two groups depending on the information they are using: ensemble methods using consensus of many alternative models and methods only using a single model to do its prediction. The consensus methods excel in achieving high correlations between prediction and true quality measures. However, they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model, nor can they be used to generate and score new structures. Single-model methods on the other hand do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used both to sample new structures and to improve existing consensus methods.Results:Here, we present an implementation of the ProQ2 program to estimate both local and global model accuracy as part of the Rosetta modeling suite. The current implementation does not only make it possible to run large batch runs locally, but it also opens up a whole new arena for conformational sampling using machine learned scoring functions and to incorporate model accuracy estimation in to various existing modeling schemes. ProQ2 participated in CASP11 and results from CASP11 are used to benchmark the current implementation. Based on results from CASP11 and CAMEO-QE, a continuous benchmark of quality estimation methods, it is clear that ProQ2 is the single-model method that performs best in both local and global model accuracy.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/bjornwallner/ProQ_scriptsContact:bjornw@ifm.liu.seSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	5	1698	2147	670	57	1727	0.416270142839	0.313121106612	0.240649519703	0.229798740762	-0.591936181667	0.887401712341	3.29313370455	NULL	1.99549758806	-1.36744400947

The simDEF approach builds optimized definition vectors for all relevant GO terms, and expresses the similarity of a pair of proteins as the cosine of the angle between their definition vectors. Relative to existing similarity measures, when validated on a yeast reference database, simDEF improves correlation with sequence homology by up to 50%, shows a correlation improvement >4% with gene expression in the biological process hierarchy of GO and increases PPI predictability by > 2.5% in F1 score for molecular function hierarchy.Availability and implementation:Datasets, results and source code are available athttp://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/simDEFContact:ahmad.pgh@dal.caorbeiko@cs.dal.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1700	957	630	1583	271	0.38065257925	0.314932112928	0.311334063943	0.296950476696	1.46831532912	-1.16040128514	3.49163167152	NULL	-1.02241106294	3.02211866944

Both types of perturbations can affect gene expression levels and disease outcome. Integrative analysis of cancer genomics data may therefore improve detection of perturbed genes and prediction of disease state. As different data types are usually dependent, analysis based on independence assumptions will make inefficient use of the data and potentially lead to false conclusions.Model: Here, we present PINCAGE (Probabilistic INtegration of CAncer GEnomics data), a method that uses probabilistic integration of cancer genomics data for combined evaluation of RNA-seq gene expression and 450k array DNA methylation measurements of promoters as well as gene bodies. It models the dependence between expression and methylation using modular graphical models, which also allows future inclusion of additional data types.Results: We apply our approach to a Breast Invasive Carcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, which includes 82 adjacent normal and 730 cancer samples. We identify new biomarker candidates of breast cancer development (PTF1A, RABIF, RAG1AP1, TIMM17A, LOC148145) and progression (SERPINE3, ZNF706). PINCAGE discriminates better between normal and tumour tissue and between progressing and non-progressing tumours in comparison with established methods that assume independence between tested data types, especially when using evidence from multiple genes.

One major challenge in miRNA studies is the identification of genes targeted by miRNAs. Currently, most researchers rely on computational programs to initially identify target candidates for subsequent validation. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years for computational target prediction, there is still significant room for algorithmic improvement.Results:Here, we present an improved target prediction algorithm, which was developed by modeling high-throughput profiling data from recent CLIPL (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by RNA ligation) sequencing studies. In these CLIPL-seq studies, the RNA sequences in each miRNA-target pair were covalently linked and unambiguously determined experimentally. By analyzing the CLIPL data, many known and novel features relevant to target recognition were identified and then used to build a computational model for target prediction. Comparative analysis showed that the new algorithm had improved performance over existing algorithms when applied to independent experimental data.Availability and implementation:All the target prediction data as well as the prediction tool can be accessed at miRDB (http://mirdb.org).Contact:xwang@radonc.wustl.edu	3.0	6	1702	839	1347	2138	2246	0.359564091961	0.330763009486	0.281983199059	0.261514616338	-3.00336924835	-1.37000954198	0.0115451308534	NULL	-1.69475736773	-1.69161108487

Several methods have been developed to reconstruct 3D structures of individual chromosomes from chromosomal conformation capturing data such as Hi-C data. However, few methods can effectively reconstruct the 3D structures of an entire genome due to the difficulty of handling noisy and inconsistent inter-chromosomal contact data.Results:We generalized a 3D chromosome reconstruction method to make it capable of reconstructing 3D models of genomes from both intra- and inter-chromosomal Hi-C contact data and implemented it as a software tool called MOGEN. We validated MOGEN on synthetic datasets of a polymer worm-like chain model and a yeast genome at first, and then applied it to generate an ensemble of 3D structural models of the genome of human B-cells from a Hi-C dataset. These genome models not only were validated by some known structural patterns of the human genome, such as chromosome compartmentalization, chromosome territories, co-localization of small chromosomes in the nucleus center with the exception of chromosome 18, enriched center-toward inter-chromosomal interactions between elongated or telomere regions of chromosomes, but also demonstrated the intrinsically dynamic orientations between chromosomes. Therefore, MOGEN is a useful tool for converting chromosomal contact data into 3D genome models to provide a better view into the spatial organization of genomes.Availability and implementation:The software of MOGEN is available at:http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/mogen/.Contact:chengji@missouri.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1703	387	1230	619	340	0.254137899444	0.206719542986	0.175019886664	0.16659369324	2.57942127096	-3.13886959959	-0.580675330131	NULL	2.16888841669	1.03712996132

However, the functions of vast majority of human lncRNAs are still elusive. Emerging studies revealed that the expression level of majority lncRNAs shows discordant expression pattern with their protein-coding gene neighbors in various model organisms. Therefore, it may be useful to infer lncRNAs’ potential biological function in cancer development by more comprehensive functional views of co-expressed cancer genes beyond mere physical proximity of genes. To this aim, we performed thorough searches and analyses of the interactions between lncRNA and non-neighboring cancer genes and provide a comprehensive co-expression data resource, LnCaNet. In current version, LnCaNet contains the pre-computed 8 494 907 significant co-expression pairs of 9641 lncRNAs and 2544 well-classified cancer genes in 2922 matched TCGA samples. In detail, we integrated 10 cancer gene lists from public database and calculate the co-expression with all the lncRNAs in 11 TCGA cancer types separately. Based on the resulted 110 co-expression networks, we identified 17 common regulatory pairs related to extracellular space shared in 11 cancers. We expect LnCaNet will enable researcher to explore lncRNA expression pattern, their affected cancer genes and pathways, biological significance in the context of specific cancer types and other useful annotation related to particular kind of lncRNA-cancer gene interaction.Availability and implementation:http://lncanet.bioinfo-minzhao.org/Contact:m.zhao@uq.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	6	1704	2174	1202	526	1158	0.451668779177	0.34115746086	0.324514607863	0.302880775818	-2.45984018596	0.37236613608	-1.41603658137	NULL	-2.20872009492	-0.801863401011

In this work we presentParDRe, ade novoparallel tool to remove duplicated and near-duplicated reads through the clustering of Single-End or Paired-End sequences fromfastaorfastqfiles. It uses a novel bitwise approach to compare the suffixes of DNA strings and employs hybrid MPI/multithreading to reduce runtime on multicore systems.

1805	https://wurmlab.github.io/tools/genevalidator	1806	NULL	GeneValidator	Summary: Genomes of emerging model organisms are now being sequenced at very low cost. However, obtaining accurate gene predictions remains challenging: even the best gene prediction algorithms make substantial errors and can jeopardize subsequent analyses. Therefore, many predicted genes must be time-consumingly visually inspected and manually curated. We developed GeneValidator (GV) to automatically identify problematic gene predictions and to aid manual curation. For each gene, GV performs multiple analyses based on comparisons to gene sequences from large databases. The resulting report identifies problematic gene predictions and includes extensive statistics and graphs for each prediction to guide manual curation efforts. GV thus accelerates and enhances the work of biocurators and researchers who need accurate gene predictions from newly sequenced genomes.Availability and implementation: GV can be used through a web interface or in the command-line.

However, the annotation of small molecules (both endogenous and synthetic) to meaningful biological pathways and concepts still lags behind the analytical capabilities and the chemistry-based annotations. Furthermore, no tools are available to visually explore relationships and networks among functionally related groups of metabolites (biomedical concepts). Such a tool would provide the ability to establish testable hypotheses regarding links among metabolic pathways, cellular processes, phenotypes and diseases.Results:Here we present ConceptMetab, an interactive web-based tool for mapping and exploring the relationships among 16 069 biologically defined metabolite sets developed from Gene Ontology, KEGG and Medical Subject Headings, using both KEGG and PubChem compound identifiers, and based on statistical tests for association.

1810	https://github.com/pcdslab/MSREDUCE	1811	NULL	MS-REDUCE	Motivation: Modern proteomics studies utilize high-throughput mass spectrometers which can produce data at an astonishing rate. These big mass spectrometry (MS) datasets can easily reach peta-scale level creating storage and analytic problems for large-scale systems biology studies. Each spectrum consists of thousands of peaks which have to be processed to deduce the peptide. However, only a small percentage of peaks in a spectrum are useful for peptide deduction as most of the peaks are either noise or not useful for a given spectrum. This redundant processing ofnon-usefulpeaks is a bottleneck for streaming high-throughput processing of big MS data. One way to reduce the amount of computation required in a high-throughput environment is to eliminate non-useful peaks. Existing noise removing algorithms are limited in their data-reduction capability and are compute intensive making them unsuitable for big data and high-throughput environments. In this paper we introduce a novel low-complexity technique based on classification, quantization and sampling of MS peaks.Results: We present a novel data-reductive strategy for analysis of Big MS data. Our algorithm, called MS-REDUCE, is capable of eliminating noisy peaks as well as peaks that do not contribute to peptide deductionbeforeany peptide deduction is attempted. Our experiments have shown up to 100× speed up over existing state of the art noise elimination algorithms while maintaining comparable high quality matches. Using our approach we were able to process a million spectra in just under an hour on a moderate server.Availability and implementation:The developed tool and strategy has been made available to wider proteomics and parallel computing community and the code can be found athttps://github.com/pcdslab/MSREDUCEContact:fahad.saeed@wmich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1718	2175	2217	911	2089	0.316950257736	0.24710608049	0.235143607207	0.207012022514	-2.0557429103	-0.650394190703	0.952274626974	NULL	-0.874014175022	1.55494750508

Building on previously published work with the single sample SNV caller genotype model selection (GeMS), a multiple sample version of GeMS (MultiGeMS) is introduced. Unlike other popular multiple sample SNV callers, the MultiGeMS statistical model accounts for enzymatic substitution sequencing errors. It also addresses the multiple testing problem endemic to multiple sample SNV calling and utilizes high performance computing (HPC) techniques.Results:A simulation study demonstrates that MultiGeMS ranks highest in precision among a selection of popular multiple sample SNV callers, while showing exceptional recall in calling common SNVs. Further, both simulation studies and real data analyses indicate that MultiGeMS is robust to low-quality data. We also demonstrate that accounting for enzymatic substitution sequencing errors not only improves SNV call precision at low mapping quality regions, but also improves recall at reference allele-dominated sites with high mapping quality.Availability and implementation:The MultiGeMS package can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/cui-lab/multigems.Contact:xinping.cui@ucr.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1720	1307	2031	2172	1254	0.282002683244	0.138161789917	0.129783924117	0.123623984653	0.201649094331	1.19008404242	-4.09177283579	NULL	-2.2496043802	-1.26933017262

Large-scale MeSH indexing has two challenging aspects: the citation side and MeSH side. For the citation side, all existing methods, including Medical Text Indexer (MTI) by National Library of Medicine and the state-of-the-art method, MeSHLabeler, deal with text by bag-of-words, which cannot capture semantic and context-dependent information well.Methods:We propose DeepMeSH that incorporates deep semantic information for large-scale MeSH indexing. It addresses the two challenges in both citation and MeSH sides. The citation side challenge is solved by a new deep semantic representation, D2V-TFIDF, which concatenates both sparse and dense semantic representations. The MeSH side challenge is solved by using the ‘learning to rank’ framework of MeSHLabeler, which integrates various types of evidence generated from the new semantic representation.Results:DeepMeSH achieved a Micro F-measure of 0.6323, 2% higher than 0.6218 of MeSHLabeler and 12% higher than 0.5637 of MTI, for BioASQ3 challenge data with 6000 citations.Availability and Implementation:The software is available upon request.Contact:zhusf@fudan.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	6	1722	1351	995	616	2147	0.394344856178	0.20475811738	0.160937401611	0.138150794213	-0.479981101205	-1.25330440147	0.722728393449	NULL	-1.32477575858	2.77088708355
1815	http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF	1816	[2043, 1169]	BioASF	Motivation:Biological pathways play a key role in most cellular functions. To better understand these functions, diverse computational and cell biology researchers use biological pathway data for various analysis and modeling purposes. For specifying these biological pathways, a community of researchers has defined BioPAX and provided various tools for creating, validating and visualizing BioPAX models. However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model.Results: To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language.Availability and Implementation:The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available athttp://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF.Contact:j.heringa@vu.nl	0.0	5	1723	2309	444	1678	929	0.411377879254	0.286712963316	0.264466416073	0.226995305002	2.02462186515	-0.0899738801666	1.60850408927	NULL	-0.871189733565	2.31605393174

Existing crosstalk inference methods conduct network-structure learning based on a single phenotypic feature (e.g. abundance) of a biomarker. These approaches are insufficient for analyzing perturbation data that can contain information about multiple features (e.g. abundance, activity or localization) of each biomarker.Results:We propose a computational framework for inferring phenotypic crosstalk (PHOCOS) that is suitable for high-content microscopy or other modalities that capture multiple phenotypes per biomarker. PHOCOS uses a robust graph-learning paradigm to predict direct effects from potential indirect effects and identify errors owing to noise or missing links. The result is a multi-feature, sparse network that parsimoniously captures direct and strong interactions across phenotypic attributes of multiple biomarkers. We use simulated and biological data to demonstrate the ability of PHOCOS to recover multi-attribute crosstalk networks from cellular perturbation assays.Availability and implementation:PHOCOS is available in open source athttps://github.com/AltschulerWu-Lab/PHOCOSContact:steven.altschuler@ucsf.eduorlani.wu@ucsf.edu	0.0	5	1724	1621	2062	2357	2059	0.240740547384	0.131397195576	0.125842514274	0.11702339922	2.75332367468	-0.083385043477	1.87032938927	NULL	-1.02054546279	2.76775458908
1817	http://www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/sharaku/	1818	NULL	SHARAKU	Motivation:Deep sequencing of the transcripts of regulatory non-coding RNA generates footprints of post-transcriptional processes. After obtaining sequence reads, the short reads are mapped to a reference genome, and specific mapping patterns can be detected called read mapping profiles, which are distinct from random non-functional degradation patterns. These patterns reflect the maturation processes that lead to the production of shorter RNA sequences. Recent next-generation sequencing studies have revealed not only the typical maturation process of miRNAs but also the various processing mechanisms of small RNAs derived from tRNAs and snoRNAs.Results:We developed an algorithm termed SHARAKU to align two read mapping profiles of next-generation sequencing outputs for non-coding RNAs. In contrast with previous work, SHARAKU incorporates the primary and secondary sequence structures into an alignment of read mapping profiles to allow for the detection of common processing patterns. Using a benchmark simulated dataset, SHARAKU exhibited superior performance to previous methods for correctly clustering the read mapping profiles with respect to 5′-end processing and 3′-end processing from degradation patterns and in detecting similar processing patterns in deriving the shorter RNAs. Further, using experimental data of small RNA sequencing for the common marmoset brain, SHARAKU succeeded in identifying the significant clusters of read mapping profiles for similar processing patterns of small derived RNA families expressed in the brain.Availability and Implementation:The source code of our program SHARAKU is available athttp://www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/sharaku/, and the simulated dataset used in this work is available at the same link.

They are different from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.Results:We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with ≥30 consecutive residues.Availability and implementation:http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/.Contact:lkurgan@vcu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1726	521	400	489	1803	0.223226650746	0.202787983807	0.196839951166	0.196464154391	-1.78349018003	1.81008398964	3.2851924862	NULL	2.96281830295	-0.898175290665

For a detailed understanding of the biological processes, the structure of the protein complex is essential. Given the current experimental techniques for structure determination, the vast majority of all protein complexes will never be solved by experimental techniques. In lack of experimental data, computational docking methods can be used to predict the structure of the protein complex. A common strategy is to generate many alternative docking solutions (atomic models) and then use a scoring function to select the best. The success of the computational docking technique is, to a large degree, dependent on the ability of the scoring function to accurately rank and score the many alternative docking models.Results:Here, we present ProQDock, a scoring function that predicts the absolute quality of docking model measured by a novel protein docking quality score (DockQ). ProQDock uses support vector machines trained to predict the quality of protein docking models using features that can be calculated from the docking model itself. By combining different types of features describing both the protein–protein interface and the overall physical chemistry, it was possible to improve the correlation with DockQ from 0.25 for the best individual feature (electrostatic complementarity) to 0.49 for the final version of ProQDock. ProQDock performed better than the state-of-the-art methods ZRANK and ZRANK2 in terms of correlations, ranking and finding correct models on an independent test set. Finally, we also demonstrate that it is possible to combine ProQDock with ZRANK and ZRANK2 to improve performance even further.Availability and implementation:http://bioinfo.ifm.liu.se/ProQDockContact:bjornw@ifm.liu.seSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1727	2333	2119	805	1698	0.281333958682	0.236360004158	0.231075700487	0.229798740762	-2.2811085248	2.05509857299	1.63013030221	NULL	2.62091539928	-0.464238822795

Although RepeatMasker and nHMMER are useful for identifying these repeats, they require a pre-compiled repeat library—which is not always available.De novoidentification tools such as Recon, RepeatScout or RepeatGluer serve to identify TEs purely from sequence content, but are either limited by runtimes that prohibit whole-genome use or degrade in quality in the presence of substitutions that disrupt the sequence patterns.Results: phRAIDER is ade novoTE identification tool that address the issues of excessive runtime without sacrificing sensitivity as compared to competing tools. The underlying model is a new definition of elementary repeats that incorporates the PatternHunter spaced seed model, allowing for greater sensitivity in the presence of genomic substitutions. As compared with the premier tool in the literature, RepeatScout, phRAIDER shows an average 10× speedup on any single human chromosome and has the ability to process the whole human genome in just over three hours. Here we discuss the tool, the theoretical model underlying the tool, and the results demonstrating its effectiveness.Availability and implementation: phRAIDER is an open source tool available fromhttps://github.com/karroje/phRAIDER.Contact:karroje@miamiOH.eduorSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1728	2359	1942	1761	2470	0.211331430341	0.199525628854	0.168680863989	0.166239191963	0.0920633320648	-2.99488639905	-2.19035228089	NULL	1.7451956432	0.308550483847
1821	https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap	1822	NULL	RapMap	Motivation:The alignment of sequencing reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many RNA-seq analysis tasks. When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in thede novosetting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis.Results:We introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap—our tool implementing quasi-mapping—is capable ofmappingsequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we use to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information. We demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads and the clustering of contigs fromde novoassembled transcriptomes into biologically meaningful groups.Availability and implementation:RapMap is implemented in C ++11 and is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, athttps://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap.Contact:rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	10	1729	916	1041	2393	1649	0.282512191136	0.257199844318	0.24865298931	0.239614761177	1.88748460375	-2.15392598495	-2.66214877422	NULL	-1.14699732455	-2.8662333968
1822	http://datamining-iip.fudan.edu.cn/service/DrugE-Rank	1823	NULL	DrugE-Rank	Motivation:Identifying drug–target interactions is an important task in drug discovery. To reduce heavy time and financial cost in experimental way, many computational approaches have been proposed. Although these approaches have used many different principles, their performance is far from satisfactory, especially in predicting drug–target interactions of new candidate drugs or targets.Methods:Approaches based on machine learning for this problem can be divided into two types: feature-based and similarity-based methods. Learning to rank is the most powerful technique in the feature-based methods. Similarity-based methods are well accepted, due to their idea of connecting the chemical and genomic spaces, represented by drug and target similarities, respectively. We propose a new method, DrugE-Rank, to improve the prediction performance by nicely combining the advantages of the two different types of methods. That is, DrugE-Rank uses LTR, for which multiple well-known similarity-based methods can be used as components of ensemble learning.Results:The performance of DrugE-Rank is thoroughly examined by three main experiments using data from DrugBank: (i) cross-validation on FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approved drugs before March 2014; (ii) independent test on FDA approved drugs after March 2014; and (iii) independent test on FDA experimental drugs. Experimental results show that DrugE-Rank outperforms competing methods significantly, especially achieving more than 30% improvement in Area under Prediction Recall curve for FDA approved new drugs and FDA experimental drugs.Availability:http://datamining-iip.fudan.edu.cn/service/DrugE-RankContact:zhusf@fudan.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	6	1730	1522	483	891	1270	0.423778880566	0.319609546388	0.298885640532	0.271717870082	0.16660581265	-0.0387294699896	0.851578341442	NULL	0.711479764245	2.58750283534

It is critical to well organize and index many assembled genomes to promote future genomics studies. Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT) is an important data structure of genome indexing, which has many fundamental applications; however, it is still non-trivial to construct BWT for large collection of genomes, especially for highly similar or repetitive genomes. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches cannot well support scalable parallel computing owing to their incremental nature, which is a bottleneck to use modern computers to accelerate BWT construction.Results: We propose de Bruijn branch-based BWT constructor (deBWT), a novel parallel BWT construction approach. DeBWT innovatively represents and organizes the suffixes of input sequence with a novel data structure, de Bruijn branch encoding. This data structure takes the advantage of de Bruijn graph to facilitate the comparison between the suffixes with long common prefix, which breaks the bottleneck of the BWT construction of repetitive genomic sequences. Meanwhile, deBWT also uses the structure of de Bruijn graph for reducing unnecessary comparisons between suffixes. The benchmarking suggests that, deBWT is efficient and scalable to construct BWT for large dataset by parallel computing. It is well-suited to index many genomes, such as a collection of individual human genomes, with multiple-core servers or clusters.Availability and implementation: deBWT is implemented in C language, the source code is available athttps://github.com/hitbc/deBWTorhttps://github.com/DixianZhu/deBWTContact:ydwang@hit.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1731	1405	1206	1396	516	0.275342075175	0.226501383852	0.205666045157	0.175485431809	1.94889570842	-1.25739269624	-1.45454300494	NULL	-0.270689620837	-2.40769258696

There are three types of deletions: blunt deletions, deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microsinsertions. The last two types are very common in the human genome, but they pose difficulty for the detection. Furthermore, finding deletions from sequencing data remains challenging. It is highly appealing to develop sensitive and accurate methods to detect deletions from sequencing data, especially deletions with microhomology and deletions with microinsertion.Results: We present a novel method called Sprites (SPlit Read re-alIgnment To dEtect Structural variants) which finds deletions from sequencing data. It aligns a whole soft-clipping read rather than its clipped part to the target sequence, a segment of the reference which is determined by spanning reads, in order to find the longest prefix or suffix of the read that has a match in the target sequence. This alignment aims to solve the problem of deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microinsertions.

1837	http://reveel.stanford.edu/	1838	NULL	Reveel	Motivation: Population low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic variation and genotyping a cohort. This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises of jointly discovering variants and genotyping the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward tasks on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in low-coverage population sequencing, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical.Results: Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging LD that deviates from previous Markov-based models, and which is aimed at computational efficiency as well as accuracy in capturing LD patterns present in rare haplotypes. We evaluate Reveel’s performance through extensive simulations as well as real data from the 1000 Genomes Project, and show that it achieves higher accuracy in low-frequency allele discovery and substantially lower computation cost than previous state-of-the-art methods.Availability and implementation:http://reveel.stanford.edu/.Contact:serafim@cs.stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1745	2126	1189	2336	1617	0.219764563938	0.211871831869	0.193514759816	0.188674388991	0.447257624742	0.385071746256	-2.96324616136	NULL	-0.237220441342	-0.0764442061509

However, it is still an expensive task to align the noisy long SMRT reads to reference genome by state-of-the-art aligners, which is becoming a bottleneck in applications with SMRT sequencing. Novel approach is on demand for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SMRT read alignment.Results:We propose Regional Hashing-based Alignment Tool (rHAT), a seed-and-extension-based read alignment approach specifically designed for noisy long reads. rHAT indexes reference genome by regional hash table (RHT), a hash table-based index which describes the short tokens within local windows of reference genome. In the seeding phase, rHAT utilizes RHT for efficiently calculating the occurrences of short token matches between partial read and local genomic windows to find highly possible candidate sites. In the extension phase, a sparse dynamic programming-based heuristic approach is used for reducing the cost of aligning read to the candidate sites. By benchmarking on the real and simulated datasets from various prokaryote and eukaryote genomes, we demonstrated that rHAT can effectively align SMRT reads with outstanding throughput.Availability and implementation:rHAT is implemented in C++; the source code is available athttps://github.com/HIT-Bioinformatics/rHAT.Contact:ydwang@hit.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1746	1440	1396	1833	747	0.253050268745	0.213731750252	0.204326514574	0.171819222092	2.14875125475	-1.39933856856	-2.57750376697	NULL	-0.570375822671	-3.00923794055

In particular, the colon cancer epigenome contains specific genomic regions that, along with differences in methylation levels with respect to normal colon tissue, also show increased epigenetic and gene expression heterogeneity at the population level, i.e. across tumor samples, in comparison with other regions in the genome. Tumors are highly heterogeneous at the clonal level as well, and the relationship between clonal and population heterogeneity is poorly understood.Results:We present an approach that uses sequencing reads from high-throughput sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA to reconstruct heterogeneous cell populations by assembling cell-specific methylation patterns. Our methodology is based on the solution of a specific class of minimum cost network flow problems. We use our methods to analyze the relationship between clonal heterogeneity and population heterogeneity in high-coverage data from multiple samples of colon tumor and matched normal tissues.Availability and implementation:http://github.com/hcorrada/methylFlow.Contact:hcorrada@umiacs.umd.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary informationis available atBioinformatics online.	0.0	5	1747	1293	2386	1812	1158	0.245538952336	0.226422854046	0.206820983159	0.187705191134	-1.27348402182	-0.484223645208	-3.19641333399	NULL	-2.45593983018	-1.1756378781

Haplotype assembly highly benefits from the advent of ‘future-generation’ sequencing technologies and their capability to produce long reads at increasing coverage. Existing methods are not able to deal with such data in a fully satisfactory way, either because accuracy or performances degrade as read length and sequencing coverage increase or because they are based on restrictive assumptions.Results:By exploiting a feature of future-generation technologies—the uniform distribution of sequencing errors—we designed an exact algorithm, called HapCol, that is exponential in the maximum number of corrections for each single-nucleotide polymorphism position and that minimizes the overall error-correction score. We performed an experimental analysis, comparing HapColwith the current state-of-the-art combinatorial methods both on real and simulated data. On a standard benchmark of real data, we show that HapColis competitive with state-of-the-art methods, improving the accuracy and the number of phased positions. Furthermore, experiments on realistically simulated datasets revealed that HapColrequires significantly less computing resources, especially memory. Thanks to its computational efficiency, HapColcan overcome the limits of previous approaches, allowing to phase datasets with higher coverage and without the traditional all-heterozygous assumption.Availability and implementation:Our source code is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License athttp://hapcol.algolab.eu/.Contact:bonizzoni@disco.unimib.itSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1748	1833	1276	2484	1745	0.180396925569	0.166520651886	0.163741841045	0.15864224221	2.6550452868	-1.07969553991	-2.42201748294	NULL	-0.553743192219	-2.87638935441

Majority of the existing fragment detection methods rely on database-driven search strategies to identify candidate fragments, which are inherently time-consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer fragments due to the limited sizes of databases. Also, it is difficult to alleviate the effect of noisy sequence-based predicted features such as secondary structures on the quality of fragment.Results:Here, we present FRAGSION, a database-free method to efficiently generate protein fragment library by sampling from an Input–Output Hidden Markov Model. FRAGSION offers some unique features compared to existing approaches in that it (i) is lightning-fast, consuming only few seconds of CPU time to generate fragment library for a protein of typical length (300 residues); (ii) can generate dynamic-size fragments of any length (even for the whole protein sequence) and (iii) offers ways to handle noise in predicted secondary structure during fragment sampling. On a FM dataset from the most recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, we demonstrate that FGRAGSION provides advantages over the state-of-the-art fragment picking protocol of ROSETTA suite by speeding up computation by several orders of magnitude while achieving comparable performance in fragment quality.Availability and implementation:Source code and executable versions of FRAGSION for Linux and MacOS is freely available to non-commercial users athttp://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/FRAGSION/.

1852	https://bitbucket.org/yuvalel/repgenhmm/downloads	1853	NULL	repgenHMM	Motivation: The diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random rearrangements of the receptor gene during early T and B cell development. Rearrangement scenarios are composed of random events—choices of gene templates, base pair deletions and insertions—described by probability distributions. Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence.Results: We present a Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on the Baum–Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be accurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to generate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any receptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We estimate this diversity to be≈1023≈1023≈1023for human T cells. The model gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune repertoires.Availability and implementation: Source code and sample sequence files are available athttps://bitbucket.org/yuvalel/repgenhmm/downloads.Contact:elhanati@lpt.ens.frortmora@lps.ens.frorawalczak@lpt.ens.fr	2.0	5	1760	553	2106	2331	896	0.216157384029	0.214594450833	0.178662687099	0.174134111154	2.32005519986	1.02962234552	-2.31987335328	NULL	-0.43430598531	-1.72772923141

These sequences present a source of repeat structure diversity that is commonly ignored by standard genomic tools. Unlike reads shorter than the underlying repeat structure that rely on indirect inference methods, e.g. assembly, long reads allow direct inference of satellite higher order repeat structure. To automate characterization of local centromeric tandem repeat sequence variation we have designed Alpha-CENTAURI (ALPHA satellite CENTromeric AUtomated Repeat Identification), that takes advantage of Pacific Bioscience long-reads from whole-genome sequencing datasets. By operating on reads prior to assembly, our approach provides a more comprehensive set of repeat-structure variants and is not impacted by rearrangements or sequence underrepresentation due to misassembly.Results:We demonstrate the utility of Alpha-CENTAURI in characterizing repeat structure for alpha satellite containing reads in the hydatidiform mole (CHM1, haploid-like) genome. The pipeline is designed to report local repeat organization summaries for each read, thereby monitoring rearrangements in repeat units, shifts in repeat orientation and sites of array transition into non-satellite DNA, typically defined by transposable element insertion. We validate the method by showing consistency with existing centromere high order repeat references.

1857	http://sourceforge.net/projects/aracne-ap	1858	NULL	ARACNe-AP	Summary:The accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from large scale molecular profile datasets represents one of the grand challenges of Systems Biology. The Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal. However, the initial Fixed Bandwidth (FB) implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space. Here, we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm, based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (AP) for estimating the Mutual Information. The new AP implementation (ARACNe-AP) achieves a dramatic improvement in computational performance (200× on average) over the previous methodology, while preserving the Mutual Information estimator and the Network inference accuracy of the original algorithm. Given that the previous version of ARACNe is extremely demanding, the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational resources to build complex regulatory networks from hundreds of gene expression profiles.Availability and Implementation:A JAVA cross-platform command line executable of ARACNe, together with all source code and a detailed usage guide are freely available on Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aracne-ap).

The processing of this data frequently leads to I/O bottlenecks, e. g. when analyzing a small genomic region across a large number of samples. The largest I/O burden is, however, often not imposed by the amount of data needed for the analysis but rather by index files that help retrieving this data. We have developed chopBAI, a program that can chop a BAM index (BAI) file into small pieces. The program outputs a list of BAI files each indexing a specified genomic interval. The output files are much smaller in size but maintain compatibility with existing software tools. We show how preprocessing BAI files with chopBAI can lead to a reduction of I/O by more than 95% during the analysis of 10 kb genomic regions, eventually enabling the joint analysis of more than 10 000 individuals.Availability and Implementation:The software is implemented in C ++, GPL licensed and available athttp://github.com/DecodeGenetics/chopBAIContact:birte.kehr@decode.is	0.0	4	1773	66	142	2444	2405	0.162452722095	0.148502634886	0.124977578863	0.121216088261	1.77537729067	-2.97884658986	0.130069522024	NULL	-1.26198106344	-0.398364125377

Querying tools that deal with similarities are crucial in biological network analysis because they provide meaningful results also in case of noisy data. In addition, as the size of available networks increases steadily, existing algorithms and tools are becoming unsuitable. This is rising new challenges for the design of more efficient and accurate solutions.Results:This paper presentsAPPAGATO, a stochastic and parallel algorithm to find approximate occurrences of a query network in biological networks.APPAGATOhandles node, edge and node label mismatches.

To analyse dbGaP-protected data, researchers must typically work with IT administrators and signing officials to ensure all levels of security are implemented at their institution. This is a major obstacle, impeding reproducibility and reducing the utility of archived data.Results: We present a protocol and software tool for analyzing protected data in a commercial cloud. The protocol, Rail-dbGaP, is applicable to any tool running on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce. The tool, Rail-RNA v0.2, is a spliced aligner for RNA-seq data, which we demonstrate by running on 9662 samples from the dbGaP-protected GTEx consortium dataset. The Rail-dbGaP protocol makes explicit for the first time the steps an investigator must take to develop Elastic MapReduce pipelines that analyse dbGaP-protected data in a manner compliant with NIH guidelines. Rail-RNA automates implementation of the protocol, making it easy for typical biomedical investigators to study protected RNA-seq data, regardless of their local IT resources or expertise.Availability and Implementation: Rail-RNA is available fromhttp://rail.bio. Technical details on the Rail-dbGaP protocol as well as an implementation walkthrough are available athttps://github.com/nellore/rail-dbgap.

1878	http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/OREMPRO/	1879	NULL	OREMPRO	Summary: The experimental determination of membrane protein orientation within the lipid bilayer is extremely challenging, such that computational methods are most often the only solution. Moreover, obtaining all-atom 3D structures of membrane proteins is also technically difficult, and many of the available data are either experimental low-resolution structures or theoretical models, whose structural quality needs to be evaluated. Here, to address these two crucial problems, we propose OREMPRO, a web server capable of both (i) positioning α-helical and β-sheet transmembrane domains in the lipid bilayer and (ii) assessing their structural quality. Most importantly, OREMPRO uses the sole alpha carbon coordinates, which makes it the only web server compatible with both high and low structural resolutions. Finally, OREMPRO is also interesting in its ability to process coarse-grained protein models, by using coordinates of backbone beads in place of alpha carbons.Availability and Implementation:http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/OREMPRO/Contact:guillaume.postic@univ-paris-diderot.frorjean-christophe.gelly@univ-paris-diderot.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1784	296	1032	2383	1802	0.252125431821	0.246236958231	0.202900484354	0.19553413601	-2.69578622667	2.90187058494	1.42043402936	NULL	2.29450972653	-1.64283947937

Consequently, an accurate description of the disordered state is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of a number of important biological functions. In this work we describe a new web server, Mollack, for the automated construction of unfolded ensembles that uses both experimental and molecular simulation data to construct models for the unfolded state. An important aspect of the method is that it calculates a quantitative estimate of the uncertainty in the constructed ensemble, thereby providing an objective measure of the quality of the final model.

However, standard treatment of DNA with BS does not allow disambiguation of 5mC from an additional cytosine modification, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Recently, it has been demonstrated that paired BS and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) treatment on the same sample followed by hybridization to an Infinium microarray permits the differentiation of 5hmC from 5mC.

1893	http://cm.jefferson.edu/MINTbase/	1894	NULL	MINTbase	Motivation: It has been known that mature transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that are encoded in the nuclear genome give rise to short molecules, collectively known as tRNA fragments or tRFs. Recently, we reported that, in healthy individuals and in patients, tRFs are constitutive, arise from mitochondrial as well as from nuclear tRNAs, and have composition and abundances that depend on a person’s sex, population origin and race as well as on tissue, disease and disease subtype. Our findings as well as similar work by other groups highlight the importance of tRFs and presage an increase in the community’s interest in elucidating the roles of tRFs in health and disease.Results: We created MINTbase, a web-based framework that serves the dual-purpose of being a content repository for tRFs and a tool for the interactive exploration of these newly discovered molecules. A key feature of MINTbase is that it deterministically and exhaustively enumerates all possible genomic locations where a sequence fragment can be found and indicates which fragments are exclusive to tRNA space, and thus can be considered as tRFs: this is a very important consideration given that the genomes of higher organisms are riddled with partial tRNA sequences and with tRNA-lookalikes whose aberrant transcripts can bemistakenfor tRFs. MINTbase is extremely flexible and integrates and presents tRF information from multiple yet interconnected vantage points (‘vistas’). Vistas permit the user to interactively personalize the information that is returned and the manner in which it is displayed. MINTbase can report comparative information on how a tRF is distributed across all anticodon/amino acid combinations, provides alignments between a tRNA and multiple tRFs with which the user can interact, provides details on published studies that reported a tRF as expressed, etc. Importantly, we designed MINTbase to containallpossible tRFs that could ever be produced by mature tRNAs: this allows us to report on their genomic distributions, anticodon/amino acid properties, alignments, etc. while giving users the ability toat-willinvestigate candidate tRF molecules before embarking on focused experimental explorations. Lastly, we also introduce a new labeling scheme that is tRF-sequence-based and allows users to associate a tRF with a universally unique label (‘tRF-license plate’) that is independent of a genome assembly and does not require any brokering mechanism.Availability and Implementation:MINTbase is freely accessible athttp://cm.jefferson.edu/MINTbase/.Dataset submissions to MINTbase can be initiated athttp://cm.jefferson.edu/MINTsubmit/.Contact:isidore.rigoutsos@jefferson.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1799	1166	2046	2133	1751	0.114713897944	0.0720580013302	0.0673144877126	0.0645841138089	-3.17026479448	-1.0337632642	-1.68564601342	NULL	-1.6275399049	-2.64062348064

However, automated analyses may lead to false discoveries due to inter-sample differences in quality and properties.Results:We present an R package, flowAI, containing two methods to clean FCM files from unwanted events: (i) an automatic method that adopts algorithms for the detection of anomalies and (ii) an interactive method with a graphical user interface implemented into an R shiny application. The general approach behind the two methods consists of three key steps to check and remove suspected anomalies that derive from (i) abrupt changes in the flow rate, (ii) instability of signal acquisition and (iii) outliers in the lower limit and margin events in the upper limit of the dynamic range.

1895	https://github.com/MEMO-toolbox/MEMO	1896	NULL	MEMO	Motivation:The statistical analysis of single-cell data is a challenge in cell biological studies. Tailored statistical models and computational methods are required to resolve the subpopulation structure, i.e. to correctly identify and characterize subpopulations. These approaches also support the unraveling of sources of cell-to-cell variability. Finite mixture models have shown promise, but the available approaches are ill suited to the simultaneous consideration of data from multiple experimental conditions and to censored data. The prevalence and relevance of single-cell data and the lack of suitable computational analytics make automated methods, that are able to deal with the requirements posed by these data, necessary.Results:We present MEMO, a flexible mixture modeling framework that enables the simultaneous, automated analysis of censored and uncensored data acquired under multiple experimental conditions. MEMO is based on maximum-likelihood inference and allows for testing competing hypotheses. MEMO can be applied to a variety of different single-cell data types. We demonstrate the advantages of MEMO by analyzing right and interval censored single-cell microscopy data. Our results show that an examination of censoring and the simultaneous consideration of different experimental conditions are necessary to reveal biologically meaningful subpopulation structures. MEMO allows for a stringent analysis of single-cell data and enables researchers to avoid misinterpretation of censored data. Therefore, MEMO is a valuable asset for all fields that infer the characteristics of populations by looking at single individuals such as cell biology and medicine.Availability and Implementation:MEMO is implemented in MATLAB and freely available via github (https://github.com/MEMO-toolbox/MEMO).Contacts:eva-maria.geissen@ist.uni-stuttgart.deornicole.radde@ist.uni-stuttgart.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1801	2044	1585	1168	2362	0.209753058913	0.207396601064	0.183858647168	0.166987427273	-1.8818338406	0.409215377236	-0.50987667365	NULL	-0.460456853957	-1.73712675502

Despite their large number and importance, less than 1% of all 3D protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank are of membrane proteins. This is mainly due to the challenges of crystallizing such proteins or performing NMR spectroscopy analyses. All the more so, there is only a small number of membrane protein–protein complexes with known structure. Therefore, developing computational tools for docking membrane proteins is crucial. Numerous methods for docking globular proteins exist, however few have been developed especially for membrane proteins and designed to address docking within the lipid bilayer environment.Results:We present a novel algorithm, Memdock, for docking α-helical membrane proteins which takes into consideration the lipid bilayer environment for docking as well as for refining and ranking the docking candidates. We show that our algorithm improves both the docking accuracy and the candidates ranking compared to a standard protein–protein docking algorithm.Availability and Implementation:http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/Memdock/Contacts:namih@tau.ac.ilorwolfson@tau.ac.ilSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1802	560	1032	296	1184	0.353515597447	0.33746740948	0.333927189944	0.327914876277	-2.58749349521	2.54120405086	1.54317113777	NULL	2.49966546732	-1.08813950377

They are crucial for protein folding and structural stability. Accurate prediction of residue contacts especially for long-range contacts is important to the quality ofab initostructure modeling since they can enforce strong restraints to structure assembly.Results:In this paper, we present a new Residue-Residue Contact predictor called R2C that combines machine learning-based and correlated mutation analysis-based methods, together with a two-dimensional Gaussian noise filter to enhance the long-range residue contact prediction. Our results show that the outputs from the machine learning-based method are concentrated with better performance on short-range contacts; while for correlated mutation analysis-based approach, the predictions are widespread with higher accuracy on long-range contacts. An effective query-driven dynamic fusion strategy proposed here takes full advantages of the two different methods, resulting in an impressive overall accuracy improvement. We also show that the contact map directly from the prediction model contains the interesting Gaussian noise, which has not been discovered before. Different from recent studies that tried to further enhance the quality of contact map by removing its transitive noise, we designed a new two-dimensional Gaussian noise filter, which was especially helpful for reinforcing the long-range residue contact prediction. Tested on recent CASP10/11 datasets, the overall topL/5 accuracy of our final R2C predictor is 17.6%/15.5% higher than the pure machine learning-based method and 7.8%/8.3% higher than the correlated mutation analysis-based approach for the long-range residue contact prediction.Availability and Implementation:http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/R2C/Contact:hbshen@sjtu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1803	1102	1499	379	2079	0.281741402298	0.229601877085	0.209798109215	0.203433261687	-1.72524537251	0.793818313234	3.30978684659	NULL	2.3581746705	-1.31037575394

It combines the strengths of previous approaches, and improves robustness by reducing the number of free parameters in the model by an order of magnitude.Results:We show that Romulus significantly outperforms existing methods across three sources of DNase-seq data, by assessing the performance of these tools against ChIP-seq profiles. The difference was particularly significant when applied to binding site prediction for low-information-content motifs. Our method is capable of inferring multiple binding modes for a single TF, which differ in their DNase I cut profile. Finally, using the model learned by Romulus and ChIP-seq data, we introduce Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC) as a quantitative measure of TF pioneer factor activity.

Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples.Results:A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP.Availability and Implementation:Perl script for ARGs-OAP can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/biofuture/Ublastx_stageone.

Identification of T-cell epitopes is also a key step in rational vaccine design. Most available methods are driven by informatics and are critically dependent on experimentally obtained training data. Analysis of a training set from Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) for several alleles indicates that the sampling of the peptide space is extremely sparse covering a tiny fraction of the possible nonamer space, and also heavily skewed, thus restricting the range of epitope prediction.Results: We present a new epitope prediction method that has four distinct computational modules: (i) structural modelling, estimating statistical pair-potentials and constraint derivation, (ii) implicit modelling and interaction profiling, (iii) feature representation and binding affinity prediction and (iv) use of graphical models to extract peptide sequence signatures to predict epitopes for HLA class I alleles.Conclusions: HLaffy is a novel and efficient epitope prediction method that predicts epitopes for any Class-1 HLA allele, by estimating the binding strengths of peptide-HLA complexes which is achieved through learning pair-potentials important for peptide binding. It relies on the strength of the mechanistic understanding of peptide-HLA recognition and provides an estimate of the total ligand space for each allele. The performance of HLaffy is seen to be superior to the currently available methods.Availability and implementation: The method is made accessible through a webserverhttp://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/HLaffy.Contact:nchandra@biochem.iisc.ernet.inSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1818	190	638	1889	1982	0.378286891466	0.262493865692	0.253540817012	0.239846081689	-3.1058086667	-0.0901145951616	1.99532523581	NULL	1.80637320598	1.53270397613

Peptides, especially short ones (5–15 amino acid long), are natural candidates for inhibition of protein–protein complexes due to several attractive features such as high structural compatibility with the protein binding site (mimicking the surface of one of the proteins), small size and the ability to form strong hotspot binding connections with the protein surface. Efficient rational peptide design is still a major challenge in computer aided drug design, due to the huge space of possible sequences, which is exponential in the length of the peptide, and the high flexibility of peptide conformations.Results:In this article we present PinaColada, a novel computational method for the design of peptide inhibitors for protein–protein interactions. We employ a version of the ant colony optimization heuristic, which is used to explore the exponential space (20n20n20n) of length n peptide sequences, in combination with our fast robotics motivated PepCrawler algorithm, which explores the conformational space for each candidate sequence. PinaColada is being run in parallel, on a DELL PowerEdge 2.8 GHZ computer with 20 cores and 256 GB memory, and takes up to 24 h to design a peptide of 5-15 amino acids length.Availability and implementation:An online server available at:http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PinaColada/.Contact:danielza@post.tau.ac.il;wolfson@tau.ac.il	2.0	5	1819	742	418	190	184	0.546896842931	0.248016371075	0.229954558425	0.221600201839	-2.80844482176	-0.100377559468	1.67302767742	NULL	2.25602520096	1.03126505277

The most recent techniques are built on mapping the sequenced reads against a reference database (e.g. whole genomes, marker genes, proteins) followed by application-dependent analysis steps. Although these methods have been proven to be useful in many scenarios, there is still room for improvement in species and strain level detection, mainly for low abundant organisms.Results:We propose a new method: DUDes, a reference-based taxonomic profiler that introduces a novel top-down approach to analyze metagenomic Next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples. Rather than predicting an organism presence in the sample based only on relative abundances, DUDes first identifies possible candidates by comparing the strength of the read mapping in each node of the taxonomic tree in an iterative manner. Instead of using the lowest common ancestor we propose a new approach: the deepest uncommon descendent. We showed in experiments that DUDes works for single and multiple organisms and can identify low abundant taxonomic groups with high precision.Availability and Implementation:DUDes is open source and it is available athttp://sf.net/p/dudesSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.Contact:renardB@rki.de	1.0	6	1820	557	1301	2258	2114	0.213293495881	0.173141062537	0.167726872235	0.159287706835	0.545578627839	-1.42318432227	-2.59257345883	NULL	-0.471022031196	-1.44538806199

We focus on the methylation data from Illumina’s Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One of the key issues of methylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation sites between case and control groups. Previous approaches describe data with simple summary statistics or kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the difference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture complicated underlying structure, and a kernel function-based approach lacks interpretability of results.Results:We propose a novel method D3M, for detection of differential distribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data. Our method can detect the differences in high-order moments, such as shapes of underlying distributions in methylation profiles, based on the Wasserstein metric. We test the significance of the difference between case and control groups and provide an interpretable summary of the results.

They rely on a combination of sampling and scoring methods, adapted to different scales. Polynomial Expansion of Protein Structures and Interactions for Docking (PEPSI-Dock) improves the accuracy of the first stage of the docking pipeline, which will sharpen up the final predictions. Indeed, PEPSI-Dock benefits from the precision of a very detailed data-driven model of the binding free energy used with a global and exhaustive rigid-body search space. As well as being accurate, our computations are among the fastest by virtue of the sparse representation of the pre-computed potentials and FFT-accelerated sampling techniques. Overall, this is the first demonstration of a FFT-accelerated docking method coupled with an arbitrary-shaped distance-dependent interaction potential.Results:First, we present a novel learning process to compute data-driven distant-dependent pairwise potentials, adapted from our previous method used for rescoring of putative protein–protein binding poses. The potential coefficients are learned by combining machine-learning techniques with physically interpretable descriptors. Then, we describe the integration of the deduced potentials into a FFT-accelerated spherical sampling provided by the Hex library. Overall, on a training set of 163 heterodimers, PEPSI-Dock achieves a success rate of 91% mid-quality predictions in the top-10 solutions. On a subset of the protein docking benchmark v5, it achieves 44.4% mid-quality predictions in the top-10 solutions when starting from bound structures and 20.5% when starting from unbound structures.

The inclusion of a properly defined end state allows for better modeling of the beta-barrel domain, while different emission probabilities for the adjacent residues in strands are used to incorporate knowledge concerning the asymmetric amino acid distribution occurring there. Furthermore, the training was performed using newly developed algorithms in order to optimize the labels of the training sequences. Moreover, the method is retrained on a larger, non-redundant dataset which includes recently solved structures, and a newly developed decoding method was added to the already available options. Finally, the method now allows the incorporation of evolutionary information in the form of multiple sequence alignments.Results:The results of a strict cross-validation procedure show that PRED-TMBB2 with homology information performs significantly better compared to other available prediction methods. It yields 76% in correct topology predictions and outperforms the best available predictor by 7%, with an overall SOV of 0.9.

Previous studies for quantifying the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system, called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model.

The first phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its so called leader sequence at one end of the array. It has been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader. However, apart from promoters, there is very little knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible functions. Leader properties have mainly been characterized through transcriptional initiation data from single organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has remained challenging due to their low level of sequence conservation.Results: We developed a method to successfully detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation signals. We applied our tool to the analysis of a comprehensive genomic database and identified several characteristic properties of leader sequences specific to archaea and bacteria, ranging from distinctive sizes to preferential indel localization.CRISPRleaderprovides a full annotation of the CRISPR array, its strand orientation as well as conserved core leader boundaries that can be uploaded to any genome browser.

Taxonomic analysis of microbial communities, a process referred to as binning, is one of the most challenging tasks when analyzing metagenomic reads data. The major problems are the lack of taxonomically related genomes in existing reference databases, the uneven abundance ratio of species and the limitations due to short read lengths and sequencing errors.Results: MetaProb is a novel assembly-assisted tool for unsupervised metagenomic binning. The novelty of MetaProb derives from solving a few important problems: how to divide reads into groups of independent reads, so thatk-mer frequencies are not overestimated; how to convertk-mer counts into probabilistic sequence signatures, that will correct for variable distribution ofk-mers, and for unbalanced groups of reads, in order to produce better estimates of the underlying genome statistic; how to estimate the number of species in a dataset. We show that MetaProb is more accurate and efficient than other state-of-the-art tools in binning both short reads datasets (F-measure 0.87) and long reads datasets (F-measure 0.97) for various abundance ratios. Also, the estimation of the number of species is more accurate than MetaCluster.

However, short reads are difficult to assemble and often lead to highly fragmented assemblies. The recent developments in long reads sequencing methods offer a promising way to address this issue. However, so far long reads are characterized by a high error rate, and assembling from long reads require a high depth of coverage. This motivates the development of hybrid approaches that leverage the high quality of short reads to correct errors in long reads.Results:We introduce CoLoRMap, a hybrid method for correcting noisy long reads, such as the ones produced by PacBio sequencing technology, using high-quality Illumina paired-end reads mapped onto the long reads. Our algorithm is based on two novel ideas: using a classical shortest path algorithm to find a sequence of overlapping short reads that minimizes the edit score to a long read and extending corrected regions by local assembly of unmapped mates of mapped short reads. Our results on bacterial, fungal and insect data sets show that CoLoRMap compares well with existing hybrid correction methods.Availability and Implementation:The source code of CoLoRMap is freely available for non-commercial use athttps://github.com/sfu-compbio/colormapContact:ehaghshe@sfu.caorcedric.chauve@sfu.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	6	1833	747	1205	1440	943	0.37579072843	0.369679201119	0.327364505022	0.290581454129	2.25086492178	-1.3617741835	-2.60054350504	NULL	-0.628596506587	-2.91983561456
1928	https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/GTRAC	1929	NULL	GTRAC	Motivation: The dramatic decrease in the cost of sequencing has resulted in the generation of huge amounts of genomic data, as evidenced by projects such as the UK10K and the Million Veteran Project, with the number of sequenced genomes ranging in the order of 10 K to 1 M. Due to the large redundancies among genomic sequences of individuals from the same species, most of the medical research deals with the variants in the sequences as compared with a reference sequence, rather than with the complete genomic sequences. Consequently, millions of genomes represented as variants are stored in databases. These databases are constantly updated and queried to extract information such as the common variants among individuals or groups of individuals. Previous algorithms for compression of this type of databases lack efficient random access capabilities, rendering querying the database for particular variants and/or individuals extremely inefficient, to the point where compression is often relinquished altogether.Results: We present a new algorithm for this task, called GTRAC, that achieves significant compression ratios while allowing fast random access over the compressed database. For example, GTRAC is able to compress aHomo sapiensdataset containing 1092 samples in 1.1 GB (compression ratio of 160), while allowing for decompression of specific samples in less than a second and decompression of specific variants in 17 ms. GTRAC uses and adapts techniques from information theory, such as a specialized Lempel-Ziv compressor, and tailored succinct data structures.Availability and Implementation:The GTRAC algorithm is available for download at:https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/GTRACContact:kedart@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1834	2081	1412	1552	2208	0.309009071743	0.296639971185	0.278745101606	0.224359791005	3.54247323683	-1.59172988481	-0.524582988695	NULL	-1.16164144752	-1.77939357763
1929	http://ccb.nki.nl/software/tandem	1930	NULL	TANDEM	Motivation:Clinical response to anti-cancer drugs varies between patients. A large portion of this variation can be explained by differences in molecular features, such as mutation status, copy number alterations, methylation and gene expression profiles. We show that the classic approach for combining these molecular features (Elastic Net regression on all molecular features simultaneously) results in models that are almost exclusively based on gene expression. The gene expression features selected by the classic approach are difficult to interpret as they often represent poorly studied combinations of genes, activated by aberrations in upstream signaling pathways.Results:To utilize all data types in a more balanced way, we developed TANDEM, a two-stage approach in which the first stage explains response using upstream features (mutations, copy number, methylation and cancer type) and the second stage explains the remainder using downstream features (gene expression). Applying TANDEM to 934 cell lines profiled across 265 drugs (GDSC1000), we show that the resulting models are more interpretable, while retaining the same predictive performance as the classic approach. Using the more balanced contributions per data type as determined with TANDEM, we find that response to MAPK pathway inhibitors is largely predicted by mutation data, while predicting response to DNA damaging agents requires gene expression data, in particularSLFN11expression.Availability and Implementation:TANDEM is available as an R package on CRAN (for more information, seehttp://ccb.nki.nl/software/tandem).Contact:m.michaut@nki.nlorl.wessels@nki.nlSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1835	882	1939	1905	1104	0.225723741876	0.213167166829	0.18809140875	0.171299626887	-1.46864535443	0.36631006825	-1.48053458389	NULL	-2.33890616134	-0.137649478468

These techniques hold great promise for improving structure prediction accuracy. However, each new data type comes with its own signal properties and biases, which may even be experiment specific. There is therefore a growing need for RNA structure prediction methods that can be automatically trained on new data types and readily extended to integrate and fully exploit multiple types of data.Results:Here, we develop and explore a modular probabilistic approach for integrating probing data in RNA structure prediction. It can be automatically trained given a set of known structures with probing data. The approach is demonstrated on SHAPE datasets, where we evaluate and selectively model specific correlations. The approach often makes superior use of the probing data signal compared to other methods. We illustrate the use of ProbFold on multiple data types using both simulations and a small set of structures with both SHAPE, DMS and CMCT data. Technically, the approach combines stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) with probabilistic graphical models. This approach allows rapid adaptation and integration of new probing data types.Availability and Implementation:ProbFold is implemented in C ++. Models are specified using simple textual formats.

1942	https://github.com/raivokolde/seqlm	1943	NULL	seqlm	Motivation: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach.Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches.Availability and Implementation: The methods have been implemented in R package seqlm that is available through Github:https://github.com/raivokolde/seqlmContact:rkolde@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	6	1848	1413	1456	1823	606	0.321995265838	0.244667288028	0.243546784575	0.199020738746	-1.30816838969	-0.927618619771	-3.24519064202	NULL	-2.66791475324	-1.47818041206
1943	https://github.com/childsish/sofia/releases/latest	1944	NULL	SoFIA	Motivation:Integrating heterogeneous datasets from several sources is a common bioinformatics task that often requires implementing a complex workflow intermixing database access, data filtering, format conversions, identifier mapping, among further diverse operations. Data integration is especially important when annotating next generation sequencing data, where a multitude of diverse tools and heterogeneous databases can be used to provide a large variety of annotation for genomic locations, such a single nucleotide variants or genes. Each tool and data source is potentially useful for a given project and often more than one are used in parallel for the same purpose. However, software that always produces all available data is difficult to maintain and quickly leads to an excess of data, creating an information overload rather than the desired goal-oriented and integrated result.Results:We present SoFIA, a framework for workflow-driven data integration with a focus on genomic annotation. SoFIA conceptualizes workflow templates as comprehensive workflows that cover as many data integration operations as possible in a given domain. However, these templates are not intended to be executed as a whole; instead, when given an integration task consisting of a set of input data and a set of desired output data, SoFIA derives a minimal workflow that completes the task. These workflows are typically fast and create exactly the information a user wants without requiring them to do any implementation work. Using a comprehensive genome annotation template, we highlight the flexibility, extensibility and power of the framework using real-life case studies.Availability and Implementation:https://github.com/childsish/sofia/releases/latestunder the GNU General Public LicenseContact:liam.childs@hu-berlin.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1849	250	641	1878	1602	0.215986397666	0.190468243992	0.183878797294	0.175733335169	0.36415470584	-2.43995048788	0.267029871327	NULL	-2.17494162974	0.751769621006
1944	https://bitbucket.org/jerry00/densitycut_dev	1945	NULL	densityCut	Motivation: Many biological data processing problems can be formalized as clustering problems to partition data points into sensible and biologically interpretable groups.Results: This article introduces densityCut, a novel density-based clustering algorithm, which is both time- and space-efficient and proceeds as follows: densityCut first roughly estimates the densities of data points from aK-nearest neighbour graph and then refines the densities via a random walk. A cluster consists of points falling into the basin of attraction of an estimated mode of the underlining density function. A post-processing step merges clusters and generates a hierarchical cluster tree. The number of clusters is selected from the most stable clustering in the hierarchical cluster tree. Experimental results on ten synthetic benchmark datasets and two microarray gene expression datasets demonstrate that densityCut performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms for clustering biological datasets. For applications, we focus on the recent cancer mutation clustering and single cell data analyses, namely to cluster variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations to reveal clonal architectures of individual tumours, to cluster single-cell gene expression data to uncover cell population compositions, and to cluster single-cell mass cytometry data to detect communities of cells of the same functional states or types. densityCut performs better than competing algorithms and is scalable to large datasets.Availability and Implementation: Data and the densityCut R package is available fromhttps://bitbucket.org/jerry00/densitycut_dev.Contact:condon@cs.ubc.caorsshah@bccrc.caorjiaruid@cs.ubc.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	7	1850	1476	1031	528	731	0.304967663733	0.260334438871	0.251202868399	0.244551564272	0.863811387154	-0.465312228924	-0.763117522709	NULL	-0.198677812532	-1.01072331042

Our server Rclick has been benchmarked and compared with other popular servers and methods for RNA structural alignments. In most cases, Rclick alignments were better in terms of structure overlap.

Removing biases from chromatin contact matrices generated by such techniques is a critical preprocessing step of subsequent analyses. The continuing decline of sequencing costs has led to an ever-improving resolution of the Hi-C data, resulting in very large matrices of chromatin contacts. Such large-size matrices, however, pose a great challenge on the memory usage and speed of its normalization. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast and memory-efficient methods for normalization of Hi-C data. We developed Hi-Corrector, an easy-to-use, open source implementation of the Hi-C data normalization algorithm. Its salient features are (i) scalability—the software is capable of normalizing Hi-C data of any size in reasonable times; (ii) memory efficiency—the sequential version can run on any single computer with very limited memory, no matter how little; (iii) fast speed—the parallel version can run very fast on multiple computing nodes with limited local memory.Availability and implementation:The sequential version is implemented in ANSI C and can be easily compiled on any system; the parallel version is implemented in ANSI C with the MPI library (a standardized and portable parallel environment designed for solving large-scale scientific problems).

Non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters.Results:Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97% of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are concise (∼7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (∼6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities (>96% recall ate-value <0.0001).

1963	http://sourceforge.net/projects/viquas/	1964	NULL	ViQuaS	Motivation:The combined effect of a high replication rate and the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses results in the formation of a viral quasispecies. Uncovering information about quasispecies populations significantly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug design, vaccine design and viral pathogenesis. We present a new analysis pipeline called ViQuaS for viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a novel reference-assistedde novoassembly algorithm for constructing local haplotypes. A significantly extended version of an existing global strain reconstruction algorithm is also used.Results:Benchmarking results showed that ViQuaS outperformed three other previously published methods named ShoRAH, QuRe and PredictHaplo, with improvements of at least 3.1–53.9% in recall, 0–12.1% in precision and 0–38.2% in F-score in terms of strain sequence assembly and improvements of at least 0.006–0.143 in KL-divergence and 0.001–0.035 in root mean-squared error in terms of strain frequency estimation, over the next-best algorithm under various simulation settings. We also applied ViQuaS on a real read set derived from anin vitrohuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 population, two independent datasets of foot-and-mouth-disease virus derived from the same biological sample and a real HIV-1 dataset and demonstrated better results than other methods available.Availability and implementation:http://sourceforge.net/projects/viquas/Contact:d.jayasundara@student.unimelb.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1869	1987	2077	1691	2078	0.237792861452	0.169321796239	0.150432878328	0.140013740533	1.11604823331	-0.374126874589	-2.62591280648	NULL	0.711048635547	-1.84245798409

Over time, sequence-based classifiers of IDRs have become fairly accurate and currently a major challenge is linking IDRs to their biological roles from the molecular to the systems level.Results:We describe DISOPRED3, which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict IDRs and protein-binding sites within them. Based on recent CASP evaluation results, DISOPRED3 can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of IDRs, and our self-assessment shows that it significantly improves over DISOPRED2 because its predictions are more specific across the whole board and more sensitive to IDRs longer than 20 amino acids. Predicted IDRs are annotated as protein binding through a novel SVM based classifier, which uses profile data and additional sequence-derived features. Based on benchmarking experiments with full cross-validation, we show that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it compares well with other publicly available tools.Availability and implementation:http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopredContact:d.t.jones@ucl.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	16.0	5	1870	400	947	1785	909	0.268574298477	0.156912570376	0.137620669986	0.129337609979	-1.61017812893	1.99193196145	3.30872653926	NULL	2.98389419079	-0.911471519665
1965	https://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/EPGA	1966	NULL	EPGA	Motivation:In genome assembly, the primary issue is how to determine upstream and downstream sequence regions of sequence seeds for constructing long contigs or scaffolds. When extending one sequence seed, repetitive regions in the genome always cause multiple feasible extension candidates which increase the difficulty of genome assembly. The universally accepted solution is choosing one based on read overlaps and paired-end (mate-pair) reads. However, this solution faces difficulties with regard to some complex repetitive regions. In addition, sequencing errors may produce false repetitive regions and uneven sequencing depth leads some sequence regions to have too few or too many reads. All the aforementioned problems prohibit existing assemblers from getting satisfactory assembly results.Results:In this article, we develop an algorithm, called extract paths for genome assembly (EPGA), which extracts paths from De Bruijn graph for genome assembly. EPGA uses a new score function to evaluate extension candidates based on the distributions of reads and insert size. The distribution of reads can solve problems caused by sequencing errors and short repetitive regions. Through assessing the variation of the distribution of insert size, EPGA can solve problems introduced by some complex repetitive regions. For solving uneven sequencing depth, EPGA uses relative mapping to evaluate extension candidates. On real datasets, we compare the performance of EPGA and other popular assemblers. The experimental results demonstrate that EPGA can effectively obtain longer and more accurate contigs and scaffolds.Availability and implementation:EPGA is publicly available for download athttps://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/EPGA.Contact:jxwang@csu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementarydata are available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1871	1199	488	1442	1833	0.583211118451	0.233488970253	0.225715004832	0.202377984578	3.00194588021	-1.51991471917	-1.74331306923	NULL	-0.143593534373	-3.01286284587
1966	http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/ulysses	1967	NULL	Ulysses	Motivation:The detection of structural variations (SVs) in short-range Paired-End (PE) libraries remains challenging because SV breakpoints can involve large dispersed repeated sequences, or carry inherent complexity, hardly resolvable with classical PE sequencing data. In contrast, large insert-size sequencing libraries (Mate-Pair libraries) provide higher physical coverage of the genome and give access to repeat-containing regions. They can thus theoretically overcome previous limitations as they are becoming routinely accessible. Nevertheless, broad insert size distributions and high rates of chimerical sequences are usually associated to this type of libraries, which makes the accurate annotation of SV challenging.Results:Here, we present Ulysses, a tool that achieves drastically higher detection accuracy than existing tools, both on simulated and real mate-pair sequencing datasets from the 1000 Human Genome project. Ulysses achieves high specificity over the complete spectrum of variants by assessing, in a principled manner, the statistical significance of each possible variant (duplications, deletions, translocations, insertions and inversions) against an explicit model for the generation of experimental noise. This statistical model proves particularly useful for the detection of low frequency variants. SV detection performed on a large insert Mate-Pair library from a breast cancer sample revealed a high level of somatic duplications in the tumor and, to a lesser extent, in the blood sample as well. Altogether, these results show that Ulysses is a valuable tool for the characterization of somatic mosaicism in human tissues and in cancer genomes.Availability and implementation:Ulysses is available athttp://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/ulysses.Contact:ingrid.lafontaine@upmc.frorgilles.fischer@upmc.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1872	1671	2101	1898	2006	0.263976246512	0.225953308501	0.209047335361	0.200957027419	1.89145576012	-0.643478673389	-3.44986646428	NULL	-0.0650124052351	-2.94703821341

1975	http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~mkim158/HyDRA.zip	1976	NULL	HyDRA	Summary:Gene prioritization refers to a family of computational techniques for inferring disease genes through a set of training genes and carefully chosen similarity criteria. Test genes are scored based on their average similarity to the training set, and the rankings of genes under various similarity criteria are aggregated via statistical methods. The contributions of our work are threefold: (i) first, based on the realization that there is no unique way to define an optimal aggregate for rankings, we investigate the predictive quality of a number of new aggregation methods and known fusion techniques from machine learning and social choice theory. Within this context, we quantify the influence of the number of training genes and similarity criteria on the diagnostic quality of the aggregate and perform in-depth cross-validation studies; (ii) second, we propose a new approach to genomic data aggregation, termedHyDRA(Hybrid Distance-score Rank Aggregation), which combines the advantages of score-based and combinatorial aggregation techniques. We also propose incorporating a newtop-versus-bottom(TvB) weighting feature into the hybrid schemes. The TvB feature ensures that aggregates are more reliable at the top of the list, rather than at the bottom, since only top candidates are tested experimentally; (iii) third, we propose an iterative procedure for gene discovery that operates via successful augmentation of the set of training genes by genes discovered in previous rounds, checked for consistency.Motivation:Fundamental results from social choice theory, political and computer sciences, and statistics have shown that there exists no consistent, fair and unique way to aggregate rankings. Instead, one has to decide on an aggregation approach using predefined set of desirable properties for the aggregate. The aggregation methods fall into two categories, score- and distance-based approaches, each of which has its own drawbacks and advantages. This work is motivated by the observation that merging these two techniques in a computationally efficient manner, and by incorporating additional constraints, one can ensure that the predictive quality of the resulting aggregation algorithm is very high.Results:We tested HyDRA on a number of gene sets, including autism, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, ischaemic stroke, leukemia, lymphoma and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, we performed iterative gene discovery for glioblastoma, meningioma and breast cancer, using a sequentially augmented list of training genes related to the Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni condition and other diseases. The methods outperform state-of-the-art software tools such as ToppGene and Endeavour. Despite this finding, we recommend as best practice to take the union of top-ranked items produced by different methods for the final aggregated list.Availability and implementation:The HyDRA software may be downloaded from:http://web.engr.illinois.edu/∼mkim158/HyDRA.zipContact:mkim158@illinois.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1881	1994	2141	1830	555	0.228402334776	0.204638316257	0.185516369883	0.155990207293	-1.80946293064	2.84824298921	-0.629631300381	NULL	0.2584692388	1.51337533126

To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues.Results:Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-Lpredicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. Inde novoprotein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV.

It uses an approximation to avoid the need for reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo, in the form of a prior that is a modification of the birth–death prior for the species tree. It incorporates a spike near zero in the density for node heights. The model has two extra parameters: one controls the degree of approximation and the second controls the prior distribution on the numbers of species. It is implemented as part of BEAST and requires only a few changes from a standard *BEAST analysis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and demonstrated on an empirical dataset.

There are three feature groups composed of 15 features. The first group calculates three nucleic acid composition features describing the local sequence information by means of kmers; the second group calculates six autocorrelation features describing the level of correlation between two oligonucleotides along a DNA sequence in terms of their specific physicochemical properties; the third group calculates six pseudo nucleotide composition features, which can be used to represent a DNA sequence with a discrete model or vector yet still keep considerable sequence-order information via the physicochemical properties of its constituent oligonucleotides.

However, multisample SV analysis has been stymied by the fundamental difficulties of SV calling, e.g. library insert size variability, SV alignment signal integration and detecting long-range genomic rearrangements involving disjoint loci. Extant tools suffer from poor scalability, which limits the number of genomes that can be co-analyzed and complicates analysis workflows. We have developed an approach that enables multisample SV analysis in hundreds to thousands of human genomes using commodity hardware.

1993	http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/smarts/	1994	NULL	SMARTS	Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks are focused on modeling a single response network using model organisms or cell lines. Unlike these models or cell lines, humans differ in their background expression profiles due to age, genetics and life factors. In addition, there are often differences in start and end times for time series human data and in therateof progress based on the specific individual. Thus, new methods are required to integrate time series data from multiple individuals when modeling and constructing disease response networks.Results: We developed Scalable Models for the Analysis of Regulation from Time Series (SMARTS), a method integrating static and time series data from multiple individuals to reconstruct condition-specific response networks in an unsupervised way. Using probabilistic graphical models, SMARTS iterates between reconstructing different regulatory networks and assigning individuals to these networks, taking into account varying individual start times and response rates. These models can be used to group different sets of patients and to identify transcription factors that differentiate the observed responses between these groups. We applied SMARTS to analyze human response to influenza and mouse brain development. In both cases, it was able to greatly improve baseline groupings while identifying key relevant TFs that differ between the groups. Several of these groupings and TFs are known to regulate the relevant processes while others represent novel hypotheses regarding immune response and development.Availability and implementation: Software and Supplementary information are available athttp://sb.cs.cmu.edu/smarts/.Contact:zivbj@cs.cmu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	5	1899	1170	1835	682	1532	0.166612171445	0.16339090945	0.162947750975	0.162648856408	0.307614305007	0.792906756167	0.423251129467	NULL	-0.391596221433	2.2474071562
1994	http://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR	1995	NULL	QuASAR	Motivation:Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of non-coding sequences. However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele-specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available, it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.Results:We present QuASAR, quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls, while including parameters that model base-call errors in sequencing and allelic over-dispersion. We validated our method with experimental data for which high-quality genotypes are available. Results for an additional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that QuASAR is a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.Availability and implementation:http://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR.Contact:fluca@wayne.eduorrpique@wayne.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary Materialis available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	5	1900	2262	1112	2457	998	0.237267025973	0.224660731016	0.221160492619	0.18923983019	0.259413026656	0.354193798405	-2.82497849479	NULL	-0.0734403501947	0.616551982036
1995	https://code.google.com/p/snplice/	1996	NULL	SNPlice	Rationale:The growing recognition of the importance of splicing, together with rapidly accumulating RNA-sequencing data, demand robust high-throughput approaches, which efficiently analyze experimentally derived whole-transcriptome splice profiles.Results:We have developed a computational approach, called SNPlice, for identifying cis-acting, splice-modulating variants from RNA-seq datasets. SNPlice mines RNA-seq datasets to find reads that span single-nucleotide variant (SNV) loci and nearby splice junctions, assessing the co-occurrence of variants and molecules that remain unspliced at nearby exon–intron boundaries. Hence, SNPlice highlights variants preferentially occurring on intron-containing molecules, possibly resulting from altered splicing. To illustrate co-occurrence of variant nucleotide and exon–intron boundary, allele-specific sequencing was used. SNPlice results are generally consistent with splice-prediction tools, but also indicate splice-modulating elements missed by other algorithms. SNPlice can be applied to identify variants that correlate with unexpected splicing events, and to measure the splice-modulating potential of canonical splice-site SNVs.Availability and implementation: SNPlice is freely available for download fromhttps://code.google.com/p/snplice/as a self-contained binary package for 64-bit Linux computers and as python source-code.Contact:pmudvari@gwu.eduorhorvatha@gwu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	1901	1232	1926	1122	1041	0.399534974848	0.320700058567	0.277477162414	0.244663086738	-2.90366818311	-1.05980460387	-2.26807974844	NULL	-2.04719422113	-2.00982626317
1996	http://code.google.com/p/jepeg/	1997	NULL	JEPEG	Motivation:Gene expression is influenced by variants commonly known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). On the basis of this fact, researchers proposed to use eQTL/functional information univariately for prioritizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) signals from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, most genes are influenced by multiple eQTLs which, thus, jointly affect any downstream phenotype. Therefore, when compared with the univariate prioritization approach, a joint modeling of eQTL action on phenotypes has the potential to substantially increase signal detection power. Nonetheless, a joint eQTL analysis is impeded by (i) not measuring all eQTLs in a gene and/or (ii) lack of access to individual genotypes.Results:We propose joint effect on phenotype of eQTL/functional SNPs associated with a gene (JEPEG), a novel software toolwhich uses only GWAS summary statisticsto (i) impute the summary statistics at unmeasured eQTLs and (ii) test for the joint effect of all measured and imputed eQTLs in a gene. We illustrate the behavior/performance of the developed tool by analysing the GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Stage 1 and the Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa.Conclusions: Applied analyses results suggest that JEPEG complements commonly used univariate GWAS tools by: (i) increasing signal detection power via uncovering (a) novel genes or (b) known associated genes in smaller cohorts and (ii) assisting in fine-mapping of challenging regions, e.g. major histocompatibility complex for schizophrenia.Availability and implementation:JEPEG, its associated database of eQTL SNPs and usage examples are publicly available athttp://code.google.com/p/jepeg/.Contact:dlee4@vcu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1902	1617	998	938	2113	0.435467822616	0.383420299619	0.304694647033	0.271688117992	-0.784791353167	0.802923726203	-2.53821536333	NULL	0.731339896464	1.82714667734

We have therefore developed an algorithm for rapidly computing the evolutionary distances between closely related genomes.Results:Our distance measure is based on ungapped local alignments that we anchor through pairs of maximal unique matches of a minimum length. These exact matches can be looked up efficiently using enhanced suffix arrays and our implementation requires approximately only 1 s and 45 MB RAM/Mbase analysed. The pairing of matches distinguishes non-homologous from homologous regions leading to accurate distance estimation. We show this by analysing simulated data and genome samples ranging from 29Escherichia coli/Shigellagenomes to 3085 genomes ofStreptococcus pneumoniae.Availability and implementation:We have implemented the computation of anchor distances in the multithreaded UNIX command-line programandifor ANchor DIstances.

The etiological agents are complex and recalcitrant to standard techniques of molecular biology. Drug screening against helminths has often been phenotypic and typically involves manual description of drug effect and efficacy. A key challenge is to develop automated, quantitative approaches to drug screening against helminth diseases. The quantal dose–response calculator (QDREC) constitutes a significant step in this direction. It can be used to automatically determine quantitative dose–response characteristics and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values using image-based readouts from phenotypic screens, thereby allowing rigorous comparisons of the efficacies of drug compounds. QDREC has been developed and validated in the context of drug screening for schistosomiasis, one of the most important NTDs. However, it is equally applicable to general phenotypic screening involving helminths and other complex parasites.Availability and implementation:QDREC is publically available at:http://haddock4.sfsu.edu/qdrec2/.

Similarly, DNA microarray data on NCI60 cell lines were processed to analyze mutation- or lineage-specific gene expression signatures. A combined analysis of GI50 and gene expression data to find potential associations between chemicals and genes is also a capability of this system.

References to miRNA names in the literature often deviate from standard nomenclature for various reasons, since even the official nomenclature evolves. For instance, a single miRNA name may identify two completely different molecules or two different names may refer to the same molecule. mirPub is a database with a powerful and intuitive interface, which facilitates searching for miRNA literature, addressing the aforementioned issues. To provide effective search services, mirPub applies text mining techniques on MEDLINE, integrates data from several curated databases and exploits data from its user community following a crowdsourcing approach.

2008	http://PRSice.info	2009	NULL	PRSice	Summary:A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of trait-associated alleles across many genetic loci, typically weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study. The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice (‘precise'), for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds (“high resolution”) to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as provide results calculated at broadP-value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage disequilibrium andP-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate aP-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.Availability and implementation:PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data management scripts and PLINK-1.9 to minimize computational time.

For example, it does not enable data to be added dynamically nor does it provide information for specific data points interactively. Recently, an R-based Circos tool (RCircos) has been developed to integrate Circos to R, but similarly, Rcircos can only be used to generate plots. Thus, we have developed a Circos plot tool (J-Circos) that is an interactive visualization tool that can plot Circos figures, as well as being able to dynamically add data to the figure, and providing information for specific data points using mouse hover display and zoom in/out functions. J-Circos uses the Java computer language to enable, it to be used on most operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Users can input data into J-Circos using flat data formats, as well as from the Graphical user interface (GUI).

2010	http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/PBOOST.zip	2011	NULL	PBOOST	Motivation:The importance of testing associations allowing for interactions has been demonstrated by Marchiniet al. (2005). A fast method detecting associations allowing for interactions has been proposed by Wanet al. (2010a). The method is based on likelihood ratio test with the assumption that the statistic follows the χ2distribution. Many single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs with significant associations allowing for interactions have been detected using their method. However, the assumption of χ2test requires the expected values in each cell of the contingency table to be at least five. This assumption is violated in some identified SNP pairs. In this case, likelihood ratio test may not be applicable any more. Permutation test is an ideal approach to checking theP-values calculated in likelihood ratio test because of its non-parametric nature. TheP-values of SNP pairs having significant associations with disease are always extremely small. Thus, we need a huge number of permutations to achieve correspondingly high resolution for theP-values. In order to investigate whether theP-values from likelihood ratio tests are reliable, a fast permutation tool to accomplish large number of permutations is desirable.Results:We developed a permutation tool named PBOOST. It is based on GPU with highly reliableP-value estimation. By using simulation data, we found that theP-values from likelihood ratio tests will have relative error of >100% when 50% cells in the contingency table have expected count less than five or when there is zero expected count in any of the contingency table cells. In terms of speed, PBOOST completed 107permutations for a single SNP pair from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) genome data (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007) within 1 min on a single Nvidia Tesla M2090 device, while it took 60 min in a single CPU Intel Xeon E5-2650 to finish the same task. More importantly, when simultaneously testing 256 SNP pairs for 107permutations, our tool took only 5 min, while the CPU program took 10 h. By permuting on a GPU cluster consisting of 40 nodes, we completed 1012permutations for all 280 SNP pairs reported withP-values smaller than1.6×10−121.6×10−121.6×10−12in the WTCCC datasets in 1 week.Availability and implementation:The source code and sample data are available athttp://bioinformatics.ust.hk/PBOOST.zip.Contact:gyang@ust.hk;eeyu@ust.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1916	121	856	1011	1815	0.260689803155	0.249776370128	0.205794965212	0.198294993358	-0.330330085077	3.11555718308	-1.5836697542	NULL	0.718544896057	1.59452641704

As such, it is of great importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover community substructures. Graphical representation of metagenomic count data relies on two aspects, measure of dissimilarity between samples/taxa and algorithm used to estimate coordinates to study microbiota communities. UniFrac is a dissimilarity measure commonly used in metagenomic research, but it requires a phylogenetic tree. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a popular algorithm for estimating two-dimensional (2D) coordinates for graphical representation, although alternative and higher-dimensional representations may reveal underlying community substructures invisible in 2D representations.Results: We adapt a new measure of dissimilarity, penalized Kendall’sτ-distance, which does not depend on a phylogenetic tree, and hence more readily applicable to a wider class of problems. Further, we propose to use metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) as an alternative to PCoA for graphical representation. We then devise a novel procedure for determining the number of clusters in conjunction with PAM (mPAM). We show superior performances with higher-dimensional representations. We further demonstrate the utility of mPAM for accurate clustering analysis, especially with higher-dimensional MDS models. Applications to two human microbiota datasets illustrate greater insights into the subcommunity structure with a higher-dimensional analysis.Availability and implementation: GrammR is implemented as an R-package available athttp://www.stat.osu.edu/∼statgen/SOFTWARE/GrammR/.

Despite such drastic changes to the protein sequence, FS indels and NS variants have been discovered in healthy individuals. How to discriminate disease-causing from neutral FS indels and NS variants is an understudied problem.Results:We have built a machine learning method called DDIG-in (FS) based on real human genetic variations from the Human Gene Mutation Database (inherited disease-causing) and the 1000 Genomes Project (GP) (putatively neutral). The method incorporates both sequence and predicted structural features and yields a robust performance by 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests on both FS indels and NS variants. We showed that human-derived NS variants and FS indels derived from animal orthologs can be effectively employed for independent testing of our method trained on human-derived FS indels. DDIG-in (FS) achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.59, a sensitivity of 86%, and a specificity of 72% for FS indels. Application of DDIG-in (FS) to NS variants yields essentially the same performance (MCC of 0.43) as a method that was specifically trained for NS variants.

However, clinical samples used in gene expression studies are often derived from heterogeneous mixtures with variable cell-type composition, complicating statistical analysis. Considerable effort has been devoted to modeling sample heterogeneity, and presently, there are many methods that can estimate cell proportions or pure cell-type expression from mixture data. However, there is no method that comprehensively addresses mixture analysis in the context of differential expression without relying on additional proportion information, which can be inaccurate and is frequently unavailable.Results:In this study, we consider a clinically relevant situation where neither accurate proportion estimates nor pure cell expression is of direct interest, but where we are rather interested in detecting and interpreting relevant differential expression in mixture samples. We develop a method, Cell-type COmputational Differential Estimation (CellCODE), that addresses the specific statistical question directly, without requiring a physical model for mixture components. Our approach is based on latent variable analysis and is computationally transparent; it requires no additional experimental data, yet outperforms existing methods that use independent proportion measurements. CellCODE has few parameters that are robust and easy to interpret. The method can be used to track changes in proportion, improve power to detect differential expression and assign the differentially expressed genes to the correct cell type.Availability and implementation:The CellCODE R package can be downloaded athttp://www.pitt.edu/∼mchikina/CellCODE/or installed from the GitHub repository ‘mchikina/CellCODE’.Contact:mchikina@pitt.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1929	1296	2391	1515	1939	0.281845707929	0.239063146799	0.195826090948	0.190978053547	-1.58655144956	0.0774307677574	-1.06033304652	NULL	-1.8990072587	-0.368803596861

Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using (k,x)-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds.

This growth comes at a price: a growing number of submitted protein sequences lack functional annotation. Approximately 32% of sequences submitted to the most comprehensive protein database UniProtKB are labelled as ‘Unknown protein’ or alike. Also the functionally annotated parts are reported to contain 30–40% of errors. Here, we introduce a high-throughput tool for more reliable functional annotation called Protein ANNotation withZ-score (PANNZER). PANNZER predicts Gene Ontology (GO) classes and free text descriptions about protein functionality. PANNZER uses weightedk-nearest neighbour methods with statistical testing to maximize the reliability of a functional annotation.Results: Our results in free text description line prediction show that we outperformed all competing methods with a clear margin. In GO prediction we show clear improvement to our older method that performed well in CAFA 2011 challenge.Availability and implementation: The PANNZER program was developed using the Python programming language (Version 2.6).

A major challenge, however, is the choice of target antigens. If an engineered TCR can cross-react with self-antigens in healthy tissue, the side-effects can be devastating. We present the first web server for assessing epitope sharing when designing new potential lead targets. We enable the users to find all known proteins containing their peptide of interest. The web server returns not only exact matches, but also approximate ones, allowing a number of mismatches of the users choice. For the identified candidate proteins the expression values in various healthy tissues, representing all vital human organs, are extracted from RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data as well as from some cancer tissues as control. All results are returned to the user sorted by a score, which is calculated using well-established methods and tools for immunological predictions. It depends on the probability that the epitope is created by proteasomal cleavage and its affinities to the transporter associated with antigen processing and the major histocompatibility complex class I alleles. With this framework, we hope to provide a helpful tool to exclude potential cross-reactivity in the early stage of TCR selection for use in design of adoptive T cell immunotherapy.Availability and implementation:The Expitope web server can be accessed viahttp://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/expitope.Contact:d.frishman@wzw.tum.de	1.0	4	1937	190	1506	1634	1818	0.182961210512	0.17337465211	0.167025224644	0.164830143704	-2.50884551163	-0.0392082955612	-0.0967793423865	NULL	-0.41162467468	-1.54722014489

We recently published a study in which we devised a multi-SNP predictive model for gene expression in Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), and showed that it can robustly predict the expression of a small number of genes in test individuals. Here, we validate the generality of our models by predicting expression profiles for genes in LCL in an independent study, and extend the pool of predictable genes for which we are able to explain more than 25% of their expression variability to 232 genes across 14 different cell types. As the number of people who obtained their SNP profiles through companies such as 23andMe is rising rapidly, we developedGenoExp, a web-based tool in which users can upload their individual SNP data and obtain predicted expression levels for the set of predictable genes across the 14 different cell types. Our tool thus allows users with biological knowledge to study the possible effects that their set of SNPs might have on these genes and predict their cell-specific expression levels relative to the population average.Availability and implementation:GenoExpis freely available athttp://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/GenoExp/.Contact:eran.segal@weizmann.ac.ilSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1939	1104	163	1036	1296	0.252763071134	0.230061726615	0.224838486371	0.217822935056	-1.17832185001	0.0866974921471	-1.27564523639	NULL	-1.81523426618	0.63723175871

Given that most TE annotation methods are designed to work on genome assemblies, we sought to develop a method to provide a fine-grained classification of TEs from DNA sequence reads. Here, we present a toolkit for the efficient annotation of TE families from low-coverage whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data, enabling the rapid identification of TEs in a large number of taxa. We compared our software, Transposome, with other approaches for annotating repeats from WGS data, and we show that it offers significant improvements in run time and produces more precise estimates of genomic repeat abundance.

One major challenge is that biological samples used to generate and validate the signature are often from heterogeneous biological contexts—controlled orin vitrosamples may be used to generate the signature, but patient samples may be used for validation. In addition, systematic technical biases from multiple genome-profiling platforms often mask true biological variation. Addressing such challenges will enable us to better elucidate disease mechanisms and provide improved guidance for personalized therapeutics.Results:Here, we present a pathway profiling toolkit, Adaptive Signature Selection and InteGratioN (ASSIGN), which enables robust and context-specific pathway analyses by efficiently capturing pathway activity in heterogeneous sets of samples and across profiling technologies. The ASSIGN framework is based on a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach that allows for simultaneous profiling of multiple correlated pathways and for the adaptation of pathway signatures into specific disease. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of ASSIGN in estimating pathway activity in simulated data, cell lines perturbed pathways and in primary tissues samples including The Cancer Genome Atlas breast carcinoma samples and liver samples exposed to genotoxic carcinogens.Availability and implementation:Software for our approach is available for download at:http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ASSIGN.htmlandhttps://github.com/wevanjohnson/ASSIGN.Contact:andreab@genetics.utah.eduorwej@bu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1945	227	2039	1665	929	0.253084766529	0.248572520242	0.208047902633	0.205027718664	-1.84236209891	0.840560344157	-1.41333268959	NULL	-2.02063292324	1.63364237566

ASTRAL runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed ‘bipartitions’. Despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions, ASTRAL is statistically consistent.Results:We present a new version of ASTRAL, which we call ASTRAL-II.

To improve performance and consistency of discovered markers of the initial molecular classifiers, network-based outcome prediction methods (NOPs) have been proposed. In spite of the initial claims, recent studies revealed that neither performance nor consistency can be improved using these methods. NOPs typically rely on the construction of meta-genes by averaging the expression of several genes connected in a network that encodes protein interactions or pathway information. In this article, we expose several fundamental issues in NOPs that impede on the prediction power, consistency of discovered markers and obscures biological interpretation.Results:To overcome these issues, we propose FERAL, a network-based classifier that hinges upon the Sparse Group Lasso which performs simultaneous selection of marker genes and training of the prediction model. An important feature of FERAL, and a significant departure from existing NOPs, is that it uses multiple operators to summarize genes into meta-genes. This gives the classifier the opportunity to select the most relevant meta-gene for each gene set. Extensive evaluation revealed that the discovered markers are markedly more stable across independent datasets. Moreover, interpretation of the marker genes detected by FERAL reveals valuable mechanistic insight into the etiology of breast cancer.Availability and implementation:All code is available for download at:http://homepage.tudelft.nl/53a60/resources/FERAL/FERAL.zip.Contact:j.deridder@tudelft.nlSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1947	1185	1985	2117	1444	0.173221139279	0.168267766602	0.162857491555	0.151523323354	0.33689082602	-0.105171115684	-1.65802051882	NULL	-0.894335155356	1.05342533197

In this context, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies provide a promising time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to currently used genotyping techniques.

Current summary statistics-based methods rely on global ‘best guess’ reference panels to model the genetic correlation structure of the dataset being studied. This approach, especially in admixed populations, has the potential to produce misleading results, ignores variation in local structure and is not feasible when appropriate reference panels are missing or small. Here, we develop a method, Adapt-Mix, that combines information across all available reference panels to produce estimates of local genetic correlation structure for summary statistics-based methods in arbitrary populations.Results:We applied Adapt-Mix to estimate the genetic correlation structure of both admixed and non-admixed individuals using simulated and real data.

In proteogenomics, this multi-omics data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample-specific predictions. Existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six-frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, six-frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target database and SNP integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous experiments. We overcome these limitations by introducing MSProGene, a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized RNA-Seq driven transcript databases. MSProGene is independent from existing reference databases or annotated SNPs and avoids large six-frame translated databases by constructing sample-specific transcripts. In addition, it creates a network combining RNA-Seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum-flow algorithm. It thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference. We applied MSProGene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database-independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes.Availability and implementation:MSProGene is written in Java and Python.

There is thus a high demand to develop computational methods capable of detecting these potential interacting targets efficiently.Results:As biologically annotated chemical data are becoming increasingly available, it becomes feasible to explore such existing knowledge to identify potential ligand–target interactions. Here, we introduce an online implementation of a recently published computational model for target prediction, TarPred, based on a reference library containing 533 individual targets with 179 807 active ligands. TarPred accepts interactive graphical input or input in the chemical file format of SMILES. Given a query compound structure, it provides the top ranked 30 interacting targets. For each of them, TarPred not only shows the structures of three most similar ligands that are known to interact with the target but also highlights the disease indications associated with the target.

The Illumina Nextera Mate Pair (NMP) protocol uses a circularization-based strategy that leaves behind 38-bp adapter sequences, which must be computationally removed from the data. While ‘adapter trimming’ is a well-studied area of bioinformatics, existing tools do not fully exploit the particular properties of NMP data and discard more data than is necessary.Results:We present NxTrim, a tool that strives to discard as little sequence as possible from NMP reads. NxTrim makes full use of the sequence on both sides of the adapter site to build ‘virtual libraries’ of mate pairs, paired-end reads and single-ended reads. For bacterial data, we show that aggregating these datasets allows a single NMP library to yield an assembly whose quality compares favourably to that obtained from regular paired-end reads.Availability and implementation:The source code is available athttps://github.com/sequencing/NxTrimContact:acox@illumina.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1958	2101	943	2395	1248	0.303048394356	0.261820303294	0.26118655437	0.250812803874	2.08472172645	-1.2995535204	-3.23950976873	NULL	-0.610804952648	-3.09482471839

To obtain quantitative insights into heterogeneous systems, an ensemble-based approach can be employed, in which predicted data computed from a collection of models is compared to the observed experimental results. By simultaneously fitting orthogonal structural data (e.g. small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings, dipolar electron-electron resonance spectra), the range and population of accessible macromolecule structures can be probed.Results:We have developedMESMER,software that enables the user to identify ensembles that can recapitulate experimental data by refining thousands of component collections selected from an input pool of potential structures. TheMESMERsuite includes a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline usage of the command-line tools, calculate data from structure libraries and perform analyses of conformational and structural heterogeneity.

Identifying and characterizing metal-binding sites through computational methods is necessary when experimental clues are lacking. Almost all published computational methods are designed to distinguish metal-binding sites from non-metal-binding sites. However, discrimination between different types of metal-binding sites is also needed to make more accurate predictions.Results:In this work, we proposed a novel algorithm called mFASD, which could discriminate different types of metal-binding sites effectively based on 3D structure data and is useful for accurate metal-binding site prediction. mFASD captures the characteristics of a metal-binding site by investigating the local chemical environment of a set of functional atoms that are considered to be in contact with the bound metal. Then a distance measure defined on functional atom sets enables the comparison between different metal-binding sites. The algorithm could discriminate most types of metal-binding sites from each other with high sensitivity and accuracy. We showed that cascading our method with existing ones could achieve a substantial improvement of the accuracy for metal-binding site prediction.Availability and implementation:Source code and data used are freely available fromhttp://staff.ustc.edu.cn/∼liangzhi/mfasd/Contact:liangzhi@ustc.edu.cnorhwkobe@mail.ustc.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1961	798	1101	1084	495	0.514304515895	0.469599538668	0.422210889232	0.398918780005	-0.491594507302	3.15841762374	2.59167948256	NULL	2.89798354483	0.327109895662

In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Results:Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.Availability and implementation:The C source code is available athttp://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.Contact:guillaume.filion@gmail.com	2.0	5	1962	1495	782	1314	1319	0.25233668836	0.189047273548	0.163010895909	0.157403237975	2.54215768355	-0.228309683281	-2.05204403804	NULL	-0.516309381972	-2.38568453922

The software builds on previously published statistical methods, which have been applied successfully to biomedical omics data but are difficult to use without prior experience in programming or scripting. RepExplore facilitates the analysis by providing a fully automated data processing and interactive ranking tables, whisker plot, heat map and principal component analysis visualizations to interpret omics data and derived statistics.Availability and implementation:Freely available athttp://www.repexplore.tkContact:enrico.glaab@uni.luSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1963	1104	1169	544	1719	0.165803308007	0.143988716116	0.140587302723	0.138989066543	0.226457000019	0.184518544895	-1.28650212905	NULL	-2.09214615699	0.546243850833

It is known that many topologically feasible EFMs are biologically irrelevant. Therefore, tools are needed to find the relevant ones. We present thermodynamic tEFM analysis (tEFMA) which uses the cellular metabolome to avoid the enumeration of thermodynamically infeasible EFMs. Specifically, given a metabolic network and a not necessarily complete metabolome, tEFMA efficiently returns the full set of thermodynamically feasible EFMs consistent with the metabolome. Compared with standard approaches, tEFMA strongly reduces the memory consumption and the overall runtime. Thus tEFMA provides a new way to analyze unbiasedly hitherto inaccessible large-scale metabolic networks.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/mpgerstl/tEFMAContact:christian.jungreuthmayer@boku.ac.atorjuergen.zanghellini@boku.ac.atSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1964	1972	505	1445	2210	0.143983019625	0.123039286072	0.104673445467	0.104112323444	2.59258289002	1.18236893004	1.86727985082	NULL	-0.417735277423	3.06376015049

Alignments between these networks aid functional understanding as they uncover important information, such as evolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs. A few methods have been proposed for global PPI network alignments, but because of NP-completeness of underlying sub-graph isomorphism problem, producing topologically and biologically accurate alignments remains a challenge.Results:We introduce a novel global network alignment tool, Lagrangian GRAphlet-based ALigner (L-GRAAL), which directly optimizes both the protein and the interaction functional conservations, using a novel alignment search heuristic based on integer programming and Lagrangian relaxation. We compare L-GRAAL with the state-of-the-art network aligners on the largest available PPI networks from BioGRID and observe that L-GRAAL uncovers the largest common sub-graphs between the networks, as measured by edge-correctness and symmetric sub-structures scores, which allow transferring more functional information across networks. We assess the biological quality of the protein mappings using the semantic similarity of their Gene Ontology annotations and observe that L-GRAAL best uncovers functionally conserved proteins. Furthermore, we introduce for the first time a measure of the semantic similarity of the mapped interactions and show that L-GRAAL also uncovers best functionally conserved interactions. In addition, we illustrate on the PPI networks of baker's yeast and human the ability of L-GRAAL to predict new PPIs. Finally, L-GRAAL's results are the first to show that topological information is more important than sequence information for uncovering functionally conserved interactions.Availability and implementation:L-GRAAL is coded in C++.

To overcome potential selection bias in the data included in the IEDB, a strategy was implemented that suggests a set of peptides for which different prediction methods give divergent predictions as to their binding capability. Upon experimental binding validation, these peptides entered the benchmark study.Results:The benchmark has run for 15 weeks and includes evaluation of 44 datasets covering 17 MHC alleles and more than 4000 peptide-MHC binding measurements. Inspection of the results allows the end-user to make educated selections between participating tools. Of the four participating servers, NetMHCpan performed the best, followed by ANN, SMM and finally ARB.Availability and implementation:Up-to-date performance evaluations of each server can be found online athttp://tools.iedb.org/auto_bench/mhci/weekly.

2068	http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sybilcycleFreeFlux/	2069	NULL	CycleFreeFlux	Motivation: Constraint-based metabolic modeling methods such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) are routinely used to predict metabolic phenotypes, e.g. growth rates, ATP yield or the fitness of gene knockouts. One frequent difficulty of constraint-based solutions is the inclusion of thermodynamically infeasible loops (or internal cycles), which add nonbiological fluxes to the predictions.Results: We propose a simple postprocessing of constraint-based solutions, which removes internal cycles from any given flux distributionv(0)v(0)v(0)without disturbing other fluxes not involved in the loops. This new algorithm, termed CycleFreeFlux, works by minimizing the sum of absolute fluxes||v||1||v||1||v||1while (i) conserving the exchange fluxes and (ii) using the fluxes of the original solution to bound the new flux distribution. This strategy reduces internal fluxes until at least one reaction of every possible internal cycle is inactive, a necessary and sufficient condition for the thermodynamic feasibility of a flux distribution. If alternative representations of the input flux distribution in terms of elementary flux modes exist that differ in their inclusion of internal cycles, then CycleFreeFlux is biased towards solutions that maintain the direction given byv(0)v(0)v(0)and towards solutions with lower total flux||v||1||v||1||v||1. Our method requires only one additional linear optimization, making it computationally very efficient compared to alternative strategies.Availability and implementation: We provide freely available R implementations for the enumeration of thermodynamically infeasible cycles as well as for cycle-free FBA solutions, flux variability calculations and random sampling of solution spaces.Contact:lercher@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de	1.0	5	1972	908	2398	1383	2276	0.318786791153	0.170831676625	0.164787016354	0.161096517685	2.53367187003	1.27554599427	1.84416661922	NULL	-0.415367081716	2.94921589993

The proposed GeNOSA framework uses a global optimization algorithm (OptNCA) to cope with the stringent limitations of NCA approaches in large-scale qGRNs.Results:OptNCA performs well against existing NCA-derived algorithms in terms of utilization of connectivity information and reconstruction accuracy of inferred GRNs using synthetic and realEscherichia colidatasets. For comparisons with other non-NCA-derived algorithms, OptNCA without using known qualitative regulations is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using a syntheticSaccharomyces cerevisiaedataset of the DREAM3 challenges. We successfully demonstrate GeNOSA in several applications including deducing condition-dependent regulations, establishing high-consensus qGRNs and validating a sub-network experimentally for dose–response and time–course microarray data, and discovering and experimentally confirming a novel regulation of CRP on AscG.Availability and implementation:All datasets and the GeNOSA framework are freely available fromhttp://e045.life.nctu.edu.tw/GeNOSA.Contact:syho@mail.nctu.edu.twSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	1973	461	226	103	1024	0.323775556815	0.116982714168	0.109724697376	0.106960295476	2.62010056116	2.13201487722	2.13215450814	NULL	2.14741255536	-1.70595964293

This approach can be extended to discontinuous domains (i.e. domains with ‘inserted’ domains). When tested on experimentally solved structures of multi-domain proteins, the relative domain positions were accurately found among top 5000 models in 86% of cases. AIDA server can use domain assignments provided by the user or predict them from the provided sequence. The latter approach is particularly useful for automated protein structure prediction servers. The blind test consisting of 95 CASP10 targets shows that domain boundaries could be successfully determined for 97% of targets.Availability and implementation:The AIDA package as well as the benchmark sets used here are available for download athttp://ffas.burnham.org/AIDA/.Contact:adam@sanfordburnham.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1974	1259	818	1811	1911	0.499136036991	0.332268091857	0.329869131368	0.312403009726	-3.32597086074	0.976215305681	1.38939372123	NULL	2.61467387518	-0.116480544351

However, such experiments are exceedingly time and resource intensive. It would therefore be advantageous to develop a simple computational tool to predict changes in folding rates upon mutations. Such a method should be able to rapidly provide the sequence position and chemical nature to modulate through mutation, to effect a particular change in rate. This can be of importance in protein folding, function or mechanistic studies.Results:We have developed a robust knowledge-based methodology to predict the changes in folding rates upon mutations formulated from amino and acid properties using multiple linear regression approach. We benchmarked this method against an experimental database of 790 point mutations from 26 two-state proteins. Mutants were first classified according to secondary structure, accessible surface area and position along the primary sequence. Three prime amino acid features eliciting the best relationship with folding rates change were then shortlisted for each class along with an optimized window length. We obtained a self-consistent mean absolute error of 0.36 s−1and a mean Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.81. Jack-knife test resulted in a MAE of 0.42 s−1and a PCC of 0.73. Moreover, our method highlights the importance of outlier(s) detection and studying their implications in the folding mechanism.Availability and implementation:A web server ‘Folding RaCe’ has been developed and is available athttp://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/proteinfolding/foldingrace.html.Contact:gromiha@iitm.ac.inSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1975	236	1363	1052	905	0.350924957315	0.30665191623	0.256832160644	0.248672153169	-2.26479276469	1.36552906638	2.44807120682	NULL	2.01639687275	-1.37402282289
2072	https://github.com/kasohn/hiHMM	2073	NULL	hiHMM	Motivation:Genome-wide mapping of chromatin states is essential for defining regulatory elements and inferring their activities in eukaryotic genomes. A number of hidden Markov model (HMM)-based methods have been developed to infer chromatin state maps from genome-wide histone modification data for an individual genome. To perform a principled comparison of evolutionarily distant epigenomes, we must consider species-specific biases such as differences in genome size, strength of signal enrichment and co-occurrence patterns of histone modifications.Results:Here, we present a new Bayesian non-parametric method called hierarchically linked infinite HMM (hiHMM) to jointly infer chromatin state maps in multiple genomes (different species, cell types and developmental stages) using genome-wide histone modification data. This flexible framework provides a new way to learn a consistent definition of chromatin states across multiple genomes, thus facilitating a direct comparison among them. We demonstrate the utility of this method using synthetic data as well as multiple modENCODE ChIP-seq datasets.Conclusion:The hierarchical and Bayesian non-parametric formulation in our approach is an important extension to the current set of methodologies for comparative chromatin landscape analysis.Availability and implementation:Source codes are available athttps://github.com/kasohn/hiHMM.

Existing methods aim to maximize total similarity over all aligned nodes (i.e. node conservation). Then, they evaluate alignment quality by measuring the amount of conserved edges, but onlyafterthe alignment is constructed. Thus, we recently introduced MAGNA (Maximizing Accuracy in Global Network Alignment) to directly maximize edge conservationwhileproducing alignments and showed its superiority over the existing methods. Here, we extend the original MAGNA with several important algorithmic advances into a new MAGNA++ framework.Results:MAGNA++ introduces several novelties: (i) itsimultaneouslymaximizes any one of three different measures of edge conservation (including our recent superiorS3S3S3measure) and any desired node conservation measure, which further improves alignment quality compared with maximizing only node conservation or only edge conservation; (ii) it speeds up the original MAGNA algorithm by parallelizing it to automatically use all available resources, as well as by reimplementing the edge conservation measures more efficiently; (iii) it provides a friendly graphical user interface for easy use by domain (e.g. biological) scientists; and (iv) at the same time, MAGNA++ offers source code for easy extensibility by computational scientists.Availability and implementation:http://www.nd.edu/∼cone/MAGNA++/Contact:tmilenko@nd.edu	4.0	5	1977	2218	592	1777	836	0.658710161329	0.197209933174	0.185326764043	0.15398156632	2.13491955737	-0.704599873968	1.99140539305	NULL	1.51156209624	-0.540478617628

Quantification of NETsin vitrois an important tool in studies aiming to clarify the biological and chemical factors contributing to NET production, stabilization and degradation. This estimation can be performed on the basis of fluorescent microscopy images using appropriate labelings. In this context, it is desirable to automate the analysis to eliminate both the tedious process of manual annotation and possible operator-specific biases.Results:We propose a framework for the automated determination of NET content, based on visually annotated images which are used to train a supervised machine-learning method. We derive several methods in this framework. The best results are obtained by combining these into a single prediction. The overallQ2of the combined method is 93%. By having two experts label part of the image set, we were able to compare the performance of the algorithms to the human interoperator variability. We find that the two operators exhibited a very high correlation on their overall assessment of the NET coverage area in the images (R2is 97%), although there were consistent differences in labeling at pixel level (Q2, which unlikeR2does not correct for additive and multiplicative biases, was only 89%).Availability and implementation:Open source software (under the MIT license) is available athttps://github.com/luispedro/Coelho2015_NetsDeterminationfor both reproducibility and application to new data.Contact:luis@luispedro.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1989	1168	2169	1332	945	0.184066742543	0.173848967769	0.161514617147	0.144964773536	1.29013237511	-1.30394416475	1.70030829025	NULL	0.489801923588	-1.90102591881

A cellular resolution of the tissue domain is important to adequately describe the impact of cell-based events, such as cell division, cell–cell interactions and spatially restricted signalling events. A tightly coupled cell-based mechano-regulatory simulation tool is therefore required.Results:We developed an open-source software framework for morphogenetic problems. The environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and signalling models. In addition, the software offers great flexibility to add custom extensions and biologically motivated processes. Cells are represented as highly resolved, massless elastic polygons; the viscous properties of the tissue are modelled by a Newtonian fluid. The Immersed Boundary method is used to model the interaction between the viscous and elastic properties of the cells, thus extending on the IBCell model. The fluid and signalling processes are solved using the Lattice Boltzmann method. As application examples we simulate signalling-dependent tissue dynamics.Availability and implementation:The documentation and source code are available onhttp://tanakas.bitbucket.org/lbibcell/index.htmlContact:simon.tanaka@bsse.ethz.chordagmar.iber@bsse.ethz.chSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	1990	1168	888	1634	2391	0.279894821844	0.249155502873	0.220054590693	0.219691386551	-1.82313041144	0.271402904932	-0.540119380048	NULL	-0.529701432485	-1.59810667683

Obligate intracellular pathogens, in particular, require resources of the host to replicate. Therefore, infections by these pathogens lead to alterations in the metabolism of the host, shifting in favor of pathogen protein production. Some computational identification of mechanisms of host–pathogen interactions have been proposed, but it seems the problem has yet to be approached from the metabolite-hijacking angle.Results:We propose a novel computational framework, Hi-Jack, for inferring pathway-based interactions between a host and a pathogen that relies on the idea of metabolite hijacking. Hi-Jack searches metabolic network data from hosts and pathogens, and identifies candidate reactions where hijacking occurs. A novel scoring function ranks candidate hijacked reactions and identifies pathways in the host that interact with pathways in the pathogen, as well as the associated frequent hijacked metabolites. We also describe host–pathogen interaction principles that can be used in the future for subsequent studies. Our case study onMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)revealed pathways in human—e.g. carbohydrate metabolism, lipids metabolism and pathways related to amino acids metabolism—that are likely to be hijacked by the pathogen. In addition, we report interesting potential pathway interconnections between human andMtbsuch as linkage of human fatty acid biosynthesis withMtbbiosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, or linkage of human pentose phosphate pathway with lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis inMtb.Availability and implementation:Datasets and codes are available athttp://cloud.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Hi-Jack.aspxContact:Dimitrios.Kleftogiannis@kaust.edu.saSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1991	2285	1235	123	2469	0.37463056883	0.32436108112	0.213651880948	0.185017286342	-1.27518541933	-1.60127412029	-1.15250594491	NULL	1.57777988983	2.3105095885

Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 14-3-3-binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high-throughput experiments.Results:Here, a comprehensive set of 14-3-3-binding targets from the literature was used to develop 14-3-3-binding phosphosite predictors. Position-specific scoring matrix, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discriminate experimentally determined 14-3-3-binding motifs from non-binding phosphopeptides. ANN, position-specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif window spanning from −6 to +4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular 14-3-3-binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high-scoring predictions in the FAM122A and FAM122B proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14-3-3-predictors will be generally useful.Availability and implementation:A standalone prediction web server is available athttp://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred.

Aggregation is caused by the presence of aggregation-prone regions (APRs) in the amino acid sequence of the protein. The lower the aggregation propensity of APRs and the better they are protected by native interactions within the folded structure of the protein, the more aggregation is prevented. Therefore, both the local thermodynamic stability of APRs in the native structure and their intrinsic aggregation propensity are a key parameter that needs to be optimized to prevent protein aggregation.Results:The Solubis method presented here automates the process of carefully selecting point mutations that minimize the intrinsic aggregation propensity while improving local protein stability.Availability and implementation: All information about the Solubis plugin is available athttp://solubisyasara.switchlab.org/.Contact:joost.schymkowitz@switch.vib-kuleuven.beorFrederic.Rousseau@switch.vib-kuleuven.beSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	1994	2141	1881	2038	1708	0.26310217863	0.228402334776	0.207750096802	0.200549885773	-1.82933789929	2.8856482235	-0.537760366645	NULL	1.26600220705	1.02794531783

2094	http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/SPARSE	2095	NULL	SPARSE	Motivation:RNA-Seq experiments have revealed a multitude of novel ncRNAs. The gold standard for their analysis based on simultaneous alignment and folding suffers from extreme time complexity ofO(n6)O(n6)O(n6). Subsequently, numerous faster ‘Sankoff-style’ approaches have been suggested. Commonly, the performance of such methods relies on sequence-based heuristics that restrict the search space to optimal or near-optimal sequence alignments; however, the accuracy of sequence-based methods breaks down for RNAs with sequence identities below 60%. Alignment approaches like LocARNA that do not require sequence-based heuristics, have been limited to high complexity (≥≥≥quartic time).Results:Breaking this barrier, we introduce the novel Sankoff-style algorithm ‘sparsified prediction and alignment of RNAs based on their structure ensembles (SPARSE)’, which runs inquadratic timewithout sequence-based heuristics. To achieve this low complexity, on par with sequence alignment algorithms, SPARSE features strong sparsification based on structural properties of the RNA ensembles. Following PMcomp, SPARSE gains further speed-up from lightweight energy computation. Although all existing lightweight Sankoff-style methods restrict Sankoff’s original model by disallowing loop deletions and insertions, SPARSE transfers the Sankoff algorithm to the lightweight energy model completely for the first time. Compared with LocARNA, SPARSE achieves similar alignment and better folding quality in significantly less time (speedup: 3.7). At similar run-time, it aligns low sequence identity instances substantially more accurate than RAF, which uses sequence-based heuristics.Availability and implementation:SPARSE is freely available athttp://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/SPARSE.Contact:backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	1998	168	2071	836	1070	0.387022394557	0.230653883155	0.186404019043	0.179980892416	-0.833078599079	-0.291051187731	2.48097674293	NULL	0.904015389773	-2.06526371458

Genome scaffolding (i.e. the process of ordering and orientating contigs) ofde novoassemblies usually represents the first step in most genome finishing pipelines.Results:In this article we present MeDuSa(Multi-Draft based Scaffolder), an algorithm for genome scaffolding. MeDuSaexploits information obtained from a set of (draft or closed) genomes from related organisms to determine the correct order and orientation of the contigs. MeDuSaformalizes the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimization formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it. In contrast to currently used scaffolders, it does not require either prior knowledge on the microrganisms dataset under analysis (e.g. their phylogenetic relationships) or the availability of paired end read libraries. This makes usability and running time two additional important features of our method.

2098	http://www.unc.edu/~yunmli/DISSCO	2099	NULL	DISSCO	Background:Imputation of individual level genotypes at untyped markers using an external reference panel of genotyped or sequenced individuals has become standard practice in genetic association studies. Direct imputation of summary statistics can also be valuable, for example in meta-analyses where individual level genotype data are not available. Two methods (DIST and ImpG-Summary/LD), that assume a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the association summary statistics, have been proposed for imputing association summary statistics. However, both methods assume that the correlations between association summary statistics are the same as the correlations between the corresponding genotypes. This assumption can be violated in the presence of confounding covariates.Methods:We analytically show that in the absence of covariates, correlation among association summary statistics is indeed the same as that among the corresponding genotypes, thus serving as a theoretical justification for the recently proposed methods. We continue to prove that in the presence of covariates, correlation among association summary statistics becomes the partial correlation of the corresponding genotypes controlling for covariates. We therefore develop direct imputation of summary statistics allowing covariates (DISSCO).Results:We consider two real-life scenarios where the correlation and partial correlation likely make practical difference: (i) association studies in admixed populations; (ii) association studies in presence of other confounding covariate(s). Application of DISSCO to real datasets under both scenarios shows at least comparable, if not better, performance compared with existing correlation-based methods, particularly for lower frequency variants. For example, DISSCO can reduce the absolute deviation from the truth by 3.9–15.2% for variants with minor allele frequency <5%.Availability and implementation:http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/DISSCO.Contact:yunli@med.unc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2002	2366	2073	1950	1617	0.407065777635	0.300890579848	0.282085192235	0.216569842692	-0.0295068596391	1.09736842135	-2.21516741307	NULL	0.764412901599	1.24530104576

The plugin provides three distinct three-dimensional visualization modes to highlight interactions with DNA bases and backbone, major and minor groove, and with atoms of different pharmacophoric type (hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, hydrophobic and thymine methyl). Each mode comes in three styles to focus the visual analysis on the protein or DNA side of the interface, or on the nucleotide sequence. PDIviz allows for the generation of publication quality images, all calculated data can be written to disk, and a command line interface is provided for automating tasks.

2102	http://bioinform.github.io/metasv/	2103	NULL	MetaSV	Summary:Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.Availability and implementation:Code in Python is athttp://bioinform.github.io/metasv/.Contact:rd@bina.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	6	2006	1167	1898	1671	1441	0.331022657711	0.292792651427	0.284964693869	0.274299083577	1.85303260383	-0.632561024023	-3.32587583348	NULL	0.152172719932	-2.86858289664

Recent development of transcriptome-wide RNA structure profiling through the application of structure-probing enzymes or chemicals combined with high-throughput sequencing has opened a new field that greatly expands the amount ofin vitroandin vivoRNA structural information available. The resultant datasets provide the opportunity to investigate RNA structural information on a global scale. However, the analysis of high-throughput RNA structure profiling data requires considerable computational effort and expertise.Results:We present a new platform, StructureFold, that provides an integrated computational solution designed specifically for large-scale RNA structure mapping and reconstruction across any transcriptome. StructureFold automates the processing and analysis of raw high-throughput RNA structure profiling data, allowing the seamless incorporation of wet-bench structural information from chemical probes and/or ribonucleases to restrain RNA secondary structure prediction via the RNAstructure and ViennaRNA package algorithms. StructureFold performs reads mapping and alignment, normalization and reactivity derivation, and RNA structure prediction in a single user-friendly web interface or via local installation. The variation in transcript abundance and length that prevails in living cells and consequently causes variation in the counts of structure-probing events between transcripts is accounted for. Accordingly, StructureFold is applicable to RNA structural profiling data obtainedin vivoas well as toin vitroorin silicodatasets. StructureFold is deployed via the Galaxy platform.Availability and Implementation:StructureFold is freely available as a component of Galaxy available at:https://usegalaxy.org/.Contact:yxt148@psu.eduorsma3@psu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	5	2007	1429	860	258	108	0.271330126881	0.269009219509	0.256591614508	0.244649166029	-1.46456811222	-0.651320179919	2.50135930103	NULL	-0.160923425965	-2.42005089367

Comparative structural studies of biological molecules provide useful insight into their biological relationships. However, most computational tools are designed for protein structure, and despite their importance, there is no currently available tool for comparing glycan structures in a sequence order- and size-independent manner.Results:A novel method, GS-align, is developed for glycan structure alignment and similarity measurement. GS-align generates possible alignments between two glycan structures through iterative maximum clique search and fragment superposition. The optimal alignment is then determined by the maximum structural similarity score, GS-score, which is size-independent. Benchmark tests against the Protein Data Bank (PDB)N-linked glycan library and PDB homologous/non-homologousN-glycoprotein sets indicate that GS-align is a robust computational tool to align glycan structures and quantify their structural similarity. GS-align is also applied to template-based glycan structure prediction and monosaccharide substitution matrix generation to illustrate its utility.Availability and implementation:http://www.glycanstructure.org/gsalign.Contact:wonpil@ku.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2008	1966	836	2440	591	0.323668541903	0.297725843986	0.249494719476	0.239042256484	-0.373235747836	-0.0376320617881	3.1135604786	NULL	0.872312074926	1.29544452457

Scaffolding is one of the main stages of the assembly pipeline. During this stage, contigs assembled from the paired-end reads are merged into bigger chains called scaffolds. Because of a high level of statistical noise, chimeric reads, and genome repeats the problem of scaffolding is a challenging task. Current scaffolding software packages widely vary in their quality and are highly dependent on the read data quality and genome complexity. There are no clear winners and multiple opportunities for further improvements of the tools still exist.Results:This article presents an efficient scaffolding algorithm ScaffMatch that is able to handle reads with both short ( 35 000 bp) insert sizes producing high-quality scaffolds. We evaluate our scaffolding tool with theFscore and other metrics (N50, corrected N50) on eight datasets comparing it with the most available packages.

Of primary interest in these experiments is identifying genes that are changing over time or space, for example, and then characterizing the specific expression changes. A number of robust statistical methods are available to identify genes showing differential expression among multiple conditions, but most assume conditions are exchangeable and thereby sacrifice power and precision when applied to ordered data.Results:We propose an empirical Bayes mixture modeling approach called EBSeq-HMM. In EBSeq-HMM, an auto-regressive hidden Markov model is implemented to accommodate dependence in gene expression across ordered conditions. As demonstrated in simulation and case studies, the output proves useful in identifying differentially expressed genes and in specifying gene-specific expression paths. EBSeq-HMM may also be used for inference regarding isoform expression.Availability and implementation:An R package containing examples and sample datasets is available at Bioconductor.Contact:kendzior@biostat.wisc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	6	2010	2350	1104	1483	657	0.419321240325	0.228539678774	0.199017979563	0.195597827261	-1.3792619602	-0.496490176692	-1.40895643736	NULL	-1.98257741234	-0.248931956481

Using variants from five phenotypes, we describe a data-driven approach to determine the tissue and cell types most relevant to a trait of interest and to identify the subset of regulatory features likely impacted by these variants. Last, we experimentally evaluate six predicted functional variants at six lipid-associated loci and demonstrate significant evidence for allele-specific impact on expression levels.

Because 16S rRNA sequencing is more cost-effective than whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, marker gene analysis is frequently used for broad studies that involve a large number of different samples. However, in comparison to shotgun sequencing approaches, insights into the functional capabilities of the community get lost when restricting the analysis to taxonomic assignment of 16S rRNA data.Results:Tax4Fun is a software package that predicts the functional capabilities of microbial communities based on 16S rRNA datasets.

The latter aspect particularly affects a large number of proteins from the Cys2His2zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) class of TFs, as their binding sites are often dominated by endogenous retroelements that have highly similar sequences. Here, we present recognition code-assisted discovery of regulatory elements (RCADE) for motif discovery from C2H2-ZF ChIP-seq data. RCADE combines predictions from a DNA recognition code of C2H2-ZFs with ChIP-seq data to identify models that represent the genuine DNA binding preferences of C2H2-ZF proteins. We show that RCADE is able to identify generalizable binding models even from peaks that are exclusively located within the repeat regions of the genome, where state-of-the-art motif finding approaches largely fail.Availability and implementation:RCADE is available as a webserver and also for download athttp://rcade.ccbr.utoronto.ca/.Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.Contact:t.hughes@utoronto.ca	0.0	4	2023	2128	959	335	234	0.267003737415	0.200820281336	0.194603575111	0.193905940747	0.420289766526	2.7333181674	0.934985081803	NULL	2.1785158969	-0.13257950788

Cellular lipidomes may contain tens of thousands of structures, a staggering degree of complexity whose significance is not yet fully understood. High-throughput mass spectrometry-based platforms provide a means to study this complexity, but the interpretation of lipidomic data and its integration with prior knowledge of lipid biology suffers from a lack of appropriate tools to manage the data and extract knowledge from it.Results:To facilitate the description and exploration of lipidomic data and its integration with prior biological knowledge, we have developed a knowledge resource for lipids and their biology—SwissLipids. SwissLipids provides curated knowledge of lipid structures and metabolism which is used to generate anin silicolibrary of feasible lipid structures. These are arranged in a hierarchical classification that links mass spectrometry analytical outputs to all possible lipid structures, metabolic reactions and enzymes. SwissLipids provides a reference namespace for lipidomic data publication, data exploration and hypothesis generation. The current version of SwissLipids includes over 244 000 known and theoretically possible lipid structures, over 800 proteins, and curated links to published knowledge from over 620 peer-reviewed publications.

2124	http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/bindnase/	2125	NULL	BinDNase	Motivation:Transcription factors (TFs) are a class of DNA-binding proteins that have a central role in regulating gene expression. To reveal mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, a number of computational tools have been proposed for predicting TF-DNA interaction sites. Recent studies have shown that genome-wide sequencing data on open chromatin sites from a DNase I hypersensitivity experiments (DNase-seq) has a great potential to map putative binding sites of all transcription factors in a single experiment. Thus, computational methods for analysing DNase-seq to accurately map TF-DNA interaction sites are highly needed.Results:Here, we introduce a novel discriminative algorithm, BinDNase, for predicting TF-DNA interaction sites using DNase-seq data. BinDNase implements an efficient method for selecting and extracting informative features from DNase I signal for each TF, either at single nucleotide resolution or for larger regions. The method is applied to 57 transcription factors in cell line K562 and 31 transcription factors in cell line HepG2 using data from the ENCODE project. First, we show that BinDNase compares favourably to other supervised and unsupervised methods developed for TF-DNA interaction prediction using DNase-seq data. We demonstrate the importance to model each TF with a separate prediction model, reflecting TF-specific DNA accessibility around the TF-DNA interaction site. We also show that a highly standardised DNase-seq data (pre)processing is a requisite for accurate TF binding predictions and that sequencing depth has on average only a moderate effect on prediction accuracy. Finally, BinDNase’s binding predictions generalise to other cell types, thus making BinDNase a versatile tool for accurate TF binding prediction.Availability and implementation:R implementation of the algorithm is available in:http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/bindnase/.Contact:juhani.kahara@aalto.fiSupplementary information:Supplemental dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	2028	1804	940	2380	1829	0.421876834712	0.345158142903	0.291537712838	0.270212518138	0.0123837791038	2.79653571286	0.367104626536	NULL	1.46572841062	-0.215110827886

The optimal assembly of the individual subunits is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming task. The method was tested on several representative complexes, both in the bound and unbound cases.

Such services fulfill a crucial role in ensuring transparency and reproducibility in phylogenetic research. However, digital tree data files often require some editing (e.g. rerooting) to improve the accuracy and reusability of the phylogenetic statements. Furthermore, establishing the mapping between tip labels used in a tree and taxa in a single common taxonomy dramatically improves the ability of other researchers to reuse phylogenetic estimates. As the process of curating a published phylogenetic estimate is not error-free, retaining a full record of the provenance of edits to a tree is crucial for openness, allowing editors to receive credit for their work and making errors introduced during curation easier to correct.Results: Here, we report the development of software infrastructure to support the open curation of phylogenetic data by the community of biologists. The backend of the system provides an interface for the standard database operations of creating, reading, updating and deleting records by making commits to a git repository. The record of the history of edits to a tree is preserved by git’s version control features. Hosting this data store on GitHub (http://github.com/) provides open access to the data store using tools familiar to many developers. We have deployed a server running the ‘phylesystem-api’, which wraps the interactions with git and GitHub. The Open Tree of Life project has also developed and deployed a JavaScript application that uses the phylesystem-api and other web services to enable input and curation of published phylogenetic statements.Availability and implementation: Source code for the web service layer is available athttps://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/phylesystem-api.

Therefore, we have created the AmyLoad website which collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources. The website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database. To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool.

Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped directly to miRNA hairpin sequences. This generates count-based miRNA expression data for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying epi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Supported modification types include multiple types of 3′-modifications (e.g. uridylation, adenylation), 5′-modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or single nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to miRNAs, Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results (see alsoSupplementary Material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed miRNAs within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile for specific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small RNA-Seq analysis, such as UEA workbench, seqBuster, MAGI, OASIS and CAP-miRSeq, CPSS for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is provided in theSupplementary Material.

These multi-subunit complexes can be difficult to analyze at the level of amino acid sequence in combination with the 3D structural organization of the complex. Therefore, novel tools for simultaneous analysis of structure and sequence information of complex assemblies are required to better understand the basis of molecular mechanisms and their functional implications.Results:Here, we present a web-based tool, Integrative Biology of Sequences and Structures (IBiSS), which is designed for interactively displaying 3D structures and selected sequences of subunits from large macromolecular complexes thus allowing simultaneous structure-sequence analysis such as conserved residues involved in catalysis or protein-protein interfaces.

2154	http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/NCC-AUC	2155	NULL	NCC-AUC	Motivation:In prognosis and survival studies, an important goal is to identify multi-biomarker panels with predictive power using molecular characteristics or clinical observations. Such analysis is often challenged by censored, small-sample-size, but high-dimensional genomic profiles or clinical data. Therefore, sophisticated models and algorithms are in pressing need.Results:In this study, we propose a novel Area Under Curve (AUC) optimization method for multi-biomarker panel identification named Nearest Centroid Classifier for AUC optimization (NCC-AUC). Our method is motived by the connection between AUC score for classification accuracy evaluation and Harrell’s concordance index in survival analysis. This connection allows us to convert the survival time regression problem to a binary classification problem. Then an optimization model is formulated to directly maximize AUC and meanwhile minimize the number of selected features to construct a predictor in the nearest centroid classifier framework. NCC-AUC shows its great performance by validating both in genomic data of breast cancer and clinical data of stage IB Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). For the genomic data, NCC-AUC outperforms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Support Vector Machine-based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) in classification accuracy. It tends to select a multi-biomarker panel with low average redundancy and enriched biological meanings. Also NCC-AUC is more significant in separation of low and high risk cohorts than widely used Cox model (Cox proportional-hazards regression model) and L1-Cox model (L1penalized in Cox model). These performance gains of NCC-AUC are quite robust across 5 subtypes of breast cancer. Further in an independent clinical data, NCC-AUC outperforms SVM and SVM-RFE in predictive accuracy and is consistently better than Cox model and L1-Cox model in grouping patients into high and low risk categories.Conclusion:In summary, NCC-AUC provides a rigorous optimization framework to systematically reveal multi-biomarker panel from genomic and clinical data.

These approaches are typically used in drug research to identify novel potential targets using insights from known targets. Traditional approaches that characterize targets based on their molecular characteristics and biological function require extensive experimental study of each protein and are infeasible for evaluating larger networks with poorly understood proteins. Moreover, they fail to exploit network connectivity information which is now available from systems biology methods. Adopting a network-based approach by characterizing targets using network features provides greater insights that complement these traditional techniques. To this end, we present Tenet(Target charactErization using NEtwork Topology), a network-based approach that characterizes known targets in signalling networks using topological features.Results:Tenetfirst computes a set of topological features and then leverages a support vector machine-based approach to identify predictive topological features that characterizes known targets. A characterization model is generated and it specifies which topological features are important for discriminating the targets and how these features should be combined to quantify the likelihood of a node being a target. We empirically study the performance of Tenetfrom a wide variety of aspects, using several signalling networks from BioModels with real-world curated outcomes. Results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.Availability and implementation:Our software is available freely for non-commercial purposes from:https://sites.google.com/site/cosbyntu/softwares/tenetContact:hechua@ntu.edu.sgorassourav@ntu.edu.sgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2059	839	540	428	1347	0.283174955144	0.258836949423	0.25133663615	0.243398953816	1.06312809402	0.129563618131	1.79423117605	NULL	0.496386194708	2.57487735491

Previous approaches to identify synthetic lethal genes in genome-scale metabolic networks have built on the framework of flux balance analysis (FBA), extending it either to exhaustively analyze all possible combinations of genes or formulate the problem as a bi-level mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We here propose an algorithm, Fast-SL, which surmounts the computational complexity of previous approaches by iteratively reducing the search space for synthetic lethals, resulting in a substantial reduction in running time, even for higher order synthetic lethals.Results:We performed synthetic reaction and gene lethality analysis, using Fast-SL, for genome-scale metabolic networks ofEscherichia coli,Salmonella entericaTyphimurium andMycobacterium tuberculosis.Fast-SL also rigorously identifies synthetic lethal gene deletions, uncovering synthetic lethal triplets that were not reported previously. We confirm that the triple lethal gene sets obtained for the three organisms have a precise match with the results obtained through exhaustive enumeration of lethals performed on a computer cluster. We also parallelized our algorithm, enabling the identification of synthetic lethal gene quadruplets for all three organisms in under 6 h. Overall, Fast-SL enables an efficient enumeration of higher order synthetic lethals in metabolic networks, which may help uncover previously unknown genetic interactions and combinatorial drug targets.Availability and implementation:The MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, compatible with COBRA toolbox v2.0, is available athttps://github.com/RamanLab/FastSLContact:kraman@iitm.ac.inSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	2060	1868	311	1382	1444	0.214261425451	0.160208240402	0.146637186832	0.14449892716	2.61664575944	0.783838891419	1.46299017515	NULL	-0.714927886693	2.6112180095

Plenty of cell lines have been used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) by expressing a group of genes and microRNAs. These IPSCs can differentiate into somatic cells to promote tissue regeneration. Similarly, many somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed to other cells without a stem cell state. All these findings are helpful in searching for new reprogramming methods and understanding the biological mechanism inside. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no database dedicated to integrating the reprogramming records. We built RPdb (cellular reprogramming database) to collect cellular reprogramming information and make it easy to access.

We previously developed an assay to identify millions of integrations in multiplexed barcoded samples at base-pair resolution. The sheer amount of data produced by this approach makes the mapping of individual sites non-trivial without bioinformatics support. This article presents the Genomic Integration Site Tracker (GeIST), a command-line pipeline designed to map the integration sites produced by this assay and identify the samples from which they came.

Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.Methods:The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.Results:We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain.

Traditional Pearson correlation analysis treating the observed data as absolute abundances of the microbes may lead to spurious results because the data only represent relative abundances. Special care and appropriate methods are required prior to correlation analysis for these compositional data.Results:In this article, we first discuss the correlation definition of latent variables for compositional data. We then propose a novel method called CCLasso based on least squares withℓ1ℓ1penalty to infer the correlation network for latent variables of compositional data from metagenomic data. An effective alternating direction algorithm from augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization problem.

They are often used in a biomedical context—to generate novel hypotheses about the underlying cellular processes or to derive biomarkers for classification and subtyping. The underlying molecular profiles are frequently measured and validated on animal or cellular models. Therefore the results are not immediately transferable to human. In particular, this is also the case in a study of the recently discovered interleukin-17 producing helper T cells (Th17), which are fundamental for anti-microbial immunity but also known to contribute to autoimmune diseases.Results:We propose a mathematical model for finding active subnetwork modules that are conserved between two species. These are sets of genes, one for each species, which (i) induce a connected subnetwork in a species-specific interaction network, (ii) show overall differential behavior and (iii) contain a large number of orthologous genes. We propose a flexible notion of conservation, which turns out to be crucial for the quality of the resulting modules in terms of biological interpretability. We propose an algorithm that finds provably optimal or near-optimal conserved active modules in our model. We apply our algorithm to understand the mechanisms underlying Th17 T cell differentiation in both mouse and human.

We first constructed a probabilistic, somatic mutation progression model that describes the occurrence and propagation of the event in the cellular lineage of the sample. We then built a Gaussian mixture model to represent the mixed population of somatic and germline deletions. Parameters of the mixture model could be estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm with the observed distribution of read-depth ratios at the points of discordant-read based initial deletion calls. Combined with conventional structural variation caller, SoloDel greatly increased the accuracy in classifying somatic mutations. Even without control, SoloDel maintained a comparable performance in a wide range of mutated subpopulation size (10–70%).

However, the ever increasing size and ethnic diversity of both reference panels and cohorts makes genotype imputation computationally challenging for moderately sized computer clusters. Moreover, genotype imputation requires subject-level genetic data, which unlike summary statistics provided by virtually all studies, is not publicly available. While there are much less demanding methods which avoid the genotype imputation step by directly imputing SNP statistics, e.g.DirectlyImputing summarySTatistics (DIST) proposed by our group, their implicit assumptions make them applicable only to ethnically homogeneous cohorts.Results:To decrease computational and access requirements for the analysis of cosmopolitan cohorts, we propose DISTMIX, which extends DIST capabilities to the analysis of mixed ethnicity cohorts. The method uses a relevant reference panel to directly impute unmeasured SNP statistics based only on statistics at measured SNPs and estimated/user-specified ethnic proportions. Simulations show that the proposed method adequately controls the Type I error rates.

The signal on which such studies rely upon can, however, be obscured by population stratification making it necessary to account for it in some way. Population stratification is dependent on when admixture happened and thus can occur at various levels. To aid in its inference at the genome level, we recently introducedpsiko, and comparison with leading methods indicates that it has attractive properties. However, until now, it could not be used for local ancestry inference which is preferable in cases of recent admixture as the genome level tends to be too coarse to properly account for processes acting on small segments of a genome. To also bring the powerful ideas underpinningpsikoto bear in such studies, we extended it topsiko2, which we introduce here.Availability and implementation:Source code, binaries and user manual are freely available athttps://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/psiko.Contact:Andrei-Alin.Popescu@uea.ac.ukorKatharina.Huber@cmp.uea.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2075	527	1038	1315	1766	0.214335175457	0.155834892306	0.11394286486	0.112438891471	-2.30100543972	-2.3165805747	-1.21564402872	NULL	-2.37395809437	-0.538315152646

While development of algorithms such as ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) help address the inherent inefficiencies of rejection sampling, such approaches are not as easily scaled on multiple processors. As a result, current Bayesian inference software offerings that use ABC-SMC lack the ability to scale in parallel computing environments.Results:We presental3c, a C++ framework for implementing ABC-SMC in parallel. By requiring only that users define essential functions such as the simulation model and prior distribution function,al3cabstracts the user from both the complexities of parallel programming and the details of the ABC-SMC algorithm.

Current algorithms can infer structures from information-rich contact maps that contain a limited fraction of erroneous predictions. However, it is difficult to reconstruct 3D structures from predicted contact maps that usually contain a high fraction of false contacts.Results:We describe a new, multi-step protocol that predicts protein 3D structures from the predicted contact maps. The method is based on a novel distance function acting on a fuzzy residue proximity graph, which predicts a 2D distance map from a 2D predicted contact map. The application of a Multi-Dimensional Scaling algorithm transforms that predicted 2D distance map into a coarse 3D model, which is further refined by typical modeling programs into an all-atom representation. We tested our approach on contact maps predictedde novoby MULTICOM, the top contact map predictor according to CASP10. We show that our method outperforms FT-COMAR, the state-of-the-art method for 3D structure reconstruction from 2D maps.

Consequently, the number of available complete genomic sequences is increasing rapidly. As a result, the cost to store, process, analyze and transmit the data is becoming a bottleneck for research and future medical applications. So, the need for devising efficient data compression and data reduction techniques for biological sequencing data is growing by the day. Although there exists a number of standard data compression algorithms, they are not efficient in compressing biological data. These generic algorithms do not exploit some inherent properties of the sequencing data while compressing. To exploit statistical and information-theoretic properties of genomic sequences, we need specialized compression algorithms. Five different next-generation sequencing data compression problems have been identified and studied in the literature. We propose a novel algorithm for one of these problems known asreference-based genome compression.Results:We have done extensive experiments using five real sequencing datasets. The results on real genomes show that our proposed algorithm is indeed competitive and performs better than the best known algorithms for this problem. It achieves compression ratios that are better than those of the currently best performing algorithms.

ProFET was applied on 17 established and novel protein benchmark datasets involving classification for a variety of binary and multi-class tasks. The results show state of the art performance. The extracted features’ show excellent biological interpretability. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range of high-level functions such as subcellular localization, structural classes and proteins with unique functional properties (e.g. neuropeptide precursors, thermophilic and nucleic acid binding).

Therefore shortcomings in the data processing steps can easily introduce false positives due to misalignments and erroneous normalization adjustments in large sample studies.Results:In this work, we developed a software package MetTailor featuring two novel data preprocessing steps to remedy drawbacks in the existing processing tools. First, we propose a novel dynamic block summarization (DBS) method for correcting misalignments from peak alignment algorithms, which alleviates missing data problem due to misalignments. For the purpose of verifying correct re-alignments, we propose to use the cross-sample consistency in isotopic intensity ratios as a quality metric. Second, we developed a flexible intensity normalization procedure that adjusts normalizing factors against the temporal variations in total ion chromatogram (TIC) along the chromatographic retention time (RT). We first evaluated the DBS algorithm using a curated metabolomics dataset, illustrating that the algorithm identifies misaligned peaks and correctly realigns them with good sensitivity. We next demonstrated the DBS algorithm and the RT-based normalization procedure in a large-scale dataset featuring >100 sera samples in primary Dengue infection study. Although the initial alignment was successful for the majority of peaks, the DBS algorithm still corrected ∼7000 misaligned peaks in this data and many recovered peaks showed consistent isotopic patterns with the peaks they were realigned to. In addition, the RT-based normalization algorithm efficiently removed visible local variations in TIC along the RT, without sacrificing the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed metabolites.Availability and implementation:The R package MetTailor is freely available at the SourceForge websitehttp://mettailor.sourceforge.net/.Contact:hyung_won_choi@nuhs.edu.sgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2089	2175	2217	1718	2066	0.249211147823	0.223088090735	0.207012022514	0.186394473773	-1.86346723	-0.680929493269	0.72651442848	NULL	-1.34903563348	1.45852077023

There are often systematic but unpredictable biases from batch-to-batch, so proper randomization of biologically relevant traits across batches is crucial for distinguishing true biological differences from experimental artifacts. When a large number of traits are biologically relevant, as is common for clinical studies of patients with varying sex, age, genotype and medical background, proper randomization can be extremely difficult to prepare by hand, especially because traits may affect biological inferences, such as differential expression, in a combinatorial manner. Here we present ARTS (automated randomization of multiple traits for study design), which aids researchers in study design by automatically optimizing batch assignment for any number of samples, any number of traits and any batch size.Availability and implementation:ARTS is implemented in Perl and is available atgithub.com/mmaiensc/ARTS.

Although it can be carried out using public data, such task is time-consuming and requires a specialized analysis. Therefore, to aid and simplify the evaluation of prognostic miRNA signatures in cancer, we developed SurvMicro, a free and easy-to-use web tool that assesses miRNA signatures from publicly available miRNA profiles using multivariate survival analysis. SurvMicro is composed of a wide and updated database of >40 cohorts in different tissues and a web tool where survival analysis can be done in minutes.

However, most of the existing imputation approaches suffer from either inaccurate results or heavy computational demand.Results:In this article, aiming to perform fast and accurate genotype-imputation analysis, we propose a novel, fast and yet accurate method to impute diploid genotypes. Specifically, we extend a hidden Markov model that is widely used to describe haplotype structures. But we model hidden states onto single reference haplotypes rather than onto pairs of haplotypes. Consequently the computational complexity is linear to size of reference haplotypes. We further develop an algorithm ‘merge-and-recover (MAR)’ to speed up the calculation. Working on compact representation of segmental reference haplotypes, the MAR algorithm always calculates an exact form of transition probabilities regardless of partition of segments. Both simulation studies and real-data analyses demonstrated that our proposed method was comparable to most of the existing popular methods in terms of imputation accuracy, but was much more efficient in terms of computation. The MAR algorithm can further speed up the calculation by several folds without loss of accuracy. The proposed method will be useful in large-scale imputation studies with a large number of reference subjects.Availability:The implemented multi-threading software FISH is freely available for academic use athttps://sites.google.com/site/lzhanghomepage/FISH.Contact:zlbio12@gmail.com;pyf0419@gmail.com;hdeng2@tulane.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2109	2366	2073	2293	1422	0.41341674901	0.324762753553	0.312078916022	0.24933970732	0.0967181448026	1.10713527752	-2.16517825951	NULL	0.900698237862	1.19268121207

Usually, their results are incomplete and fragmented into hundreds of contigs. Repeats in genomes and sequencing errors are the main reasons for these complications. With the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve assemblies by guiding them with genomes from related species.Results:Here we introduce AlignGraph, an algorithm for extending and joiningde novo-assembled contigs or scaffolds guided by closely related reference genomes. It aligns paired-end (PE) reads and preassembled contigs or scaffolds to a close reference. From the obtained alignments, it builds a novel data structure, called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph. The incorporated positional information from the alignments and PE reads allows us to extend the initial assemblies, while avoiding incorrect extensions and early terminations. In our performance tests, AlignGraph was able to substantially improve the contigs and scaffolds from several assemblers. For instance, 28.7–62.3% of the contigs of Arabidopsis thaliana and human could be extended, resulting in improvements of common assembly metrics, such as an increase of the N50 of the extendable contigs by 89.9–94.5% and 80.3–165.8%, respectively. In another test, AlignGraph was able to improve the assembly of a published genome (Arabidopsis strain Landsberg) by increasing the N50 of its extendable scaffolds by 86.6%.

In the wider field of probabilistic modelling, the stochastic EM (sEM) algorithm has been used to overcome some of the limitations of the EM algorithm; however, the application of sEM to motif discovery has not been fully explored.Results:We present MITSU (Motif discovery by ITerative Sampling and Updating), a novel algorithm for motif discovery, which combines sEM with an improved approximation to the likelihood function, which is unconstrained with regard to the distribution of motif occurrences within the input dataset. The algorithm is evaluated quantitatively on realistic synthetic data and several collections of characterized prokaryotic TFBS motifs and shown to outperform EM and an alternative sEM-based algorithm, particularly in terms of site-level positive predictive value.Availability and implementation:Java executable available for download athttp://www.sourceforge.net/p/mitsu-motif/, supported on Linux/OS X.Contact:a.m.kilpatrick@sms.ed.ac.uk	0.0	4	2111	2128	416	959	743	0.345646690694	0.31989402742	0.301227166517	0.272850115559	0.628521639792	2.59513172924	1.2845723146	NULL	2.46617171824	-0.0676128149727

However the vast majority of ncRNAs still have no functional annotation. One prominent approach for putative function assignment is clustering of transcripts according to sequence and secondary structure. However sequence information is changed by post-transcriptional modifications, and secondary structure is only a proxy for the true 3D conformation of the RNA polymer. A different type of information that does not suffer from these issues and that can be used for the detection of RNA classes, is the pattern of processing and its traces in small RNA-seq reads data. Here we introduceBlockClust, an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing patterns. We propose a novel way to encode expression profiles in compact discrete structures, which can then be processed using fast graph-kernel techniques. We perform both unsupervised clustering and develop family specific discriminative models; finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable, accurate and robust across different organisms, tissues and cell lines.Availability:The wholeBlockClustgalaxy workflow including all tool dependencies is available athttp://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam/blockclust_workflow.Contact:backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.de;costa@informatik.uni-freiburg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2112	860	2071	1725	730	0.282335656161	0.277553210865	0.252281535735	0.221889237545	-1.60911229391	-1.02642932284	2.19931363135	NULL	-0.762003736285	-2.47414283026
2211	http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp	2212	NULL	GRASP	Summary:We created a deeply extracted and annotated database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results. GRASP v1.0 contains >6.2 million SNP-phenotype association from among 1390 GWAS studies. We re-annotated GWAS results with 16 annotation sources including some rarely compared to GWAS results (e.g. RNAediting sites, lincRNAs, PTMs).Motivation:To create a high-quality resource to facilitate further use and interpretation of human GWAS results in order to address important scientific questions.Results:GWAS have grown exponentially, with increases in sample sizes and markers tested, and continuing bias toward European ancestry samples. GRASP contains >100 000 phenotypes, roughly: eQTLs (71.5%), metabolite QTLs (21.2%), methylation QTLs (4.4%) and diseases, biomarkers and other traits (2.8%).cis-eQTLs, meQTLs, mQTLs and MHC region SNPs are highly enriched among significant results. After removing these categories, GRASP still contains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable GWAS catalogs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors pre-dominate remaining GWAS results, followed by immunological, neurological and cancer traits. Significant results in GWAS display a highly gene-centric tendency. Sex chromosome X (OR = 0.18[0.16-0.20]) and Y (OR = 0.003[0.001-0.01]) genes are depleted for GWAS results. Gene length is correlated with GWAS results at nominal significance (P≤ 0.05) levels. We show this gene-length correlation decays at increasingly more stringentP-value thresholds. Potential pleotropic genes and SNPs enriched for multi-phenotype association in GWAS are identified. However, we note possible population stratification at some of these loci. Finally, via re-annotation we identify compelling functional hypotheses at GWAS loci, in some cases unrealized in studies to date.Conclusion:Pooling summary-level GWAS results and re-annotating with bioinformatics predictions and molecular features provides a good platform for new insights.Availability:The GRASP database is available athttp://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp.Contact:johnsonad2@nhlbi.nih.gov	9.0	5	2113	2252	1437	1639	683	0.313093300828	0.291927075182	0.290503273347	0.282452431559	-1.30227288583	0.918874070137	-2.86493633261	NULL	0.769083338975	1.82280134375

However, difficulties arise owing to the high sequence similarity between related organisms. Further, the state of conservation of proteins between species can be correlated with their expression level, which can lead to significant bias in results and interpretation. These challenges are similar but not identical to the challenges arising in the analysis of metagenomic samples and require specific solutions.Results:We introduce Pipasic (peptide intensity-weighted proteome abundance similarity correction) as a tool that corrects identification and spectral counting-based quantification results using peptide similarity estimation and expression level weighting within a non-negative lasso framework.

2213	http://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.php	2214	NULL	GUILDify	Summary:Determining genetic factors underlying various phenotypes is hindered by the involvement of multiple genes acting cooperatively. Over the past years, disease–gene prioritization has been central to identify genes implicated in human disorders. Special attention has been paid on using physical interactions between the proteins encoded by the genes to link them with diseases. Such methods exploit the guilt-by-association principle in the protein interaction network to uncover novel disease–gene associations. These methods rely on the proximity of a gene in the network to the genes associated with a phenotype and require a set of initial associations. Here, we present GUILDify, an easy-to-use web server for the phenotypic characterization of genes. GUILDify offers a prioritization approach based on the protein–protein interaction network where the initial phenotype–gene associations are retrieved via free text search on biological databases. GUILDify web server does not restrict the prioritization to any predefined phenotype, supports multiple species and accepts user-specified genes. It also prioritizes drugs based on the ranking of their targets, unleashing opportunities for repurposing drugs for novel therapies.Availability and implementation:Available online athttp://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.phpContact:baldo.oliva@upf.eduSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2115	555	1240	1444	1244	0.313227466202	0.244336228851	0.235157370021	0.218421531159	-0.42817203323	0.31991330768	-1.54455373505	NULL	-0.273509206688	1.99602067675

These microarray data could be useful for researchers around the world, but unfortunately they are underused. To fully exploit these data, it is necessary (i) to extract these data from a repository of the high-throughput gene expression data like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and (ii) to make the data from different microarrays comparable with tools easy to use for scientists. We have developed these two solutions in our server, implementing a database of microarray marker genes (Marker Genes Data Base). This database contains the marker genes of all GEO microarray datasets and it is updated monthly with the new microarrays from GEO. Thus, researchers can see whether the marker genes of their microarray are marker genes in other microarrays in the database, expanding the analysis of their microarray to the rest of the public microarrays. This solution helps not only to corroborate the conclusions regarding a researcher's microarray but also to identify the phenotype of different subsets of individuals under investigation, to frame the results with microarray experiments from other species, pathologies or tissues, to search for drugs that promote the transition between the studied phenotypes, to detect undesirable side effects of the treatment applied, etc. Thus, the researcher can quickly add relevant information to his/her studies from all of the previous analyses performed in other studies as long as they have been deposited in public repositories.Availability:Marker-gene database tool:http://ibb.uab.es/mgdbContact:jcedano@unorte.edu.uy	0.0	4	2117	1418	149	1985	2314	0.278761659827	0.253909671791	0.239352652342	0.219830930449	-0.324688109667	-0.716489164927	-0.945821858087	NULL	-1.81804197976	0.975822291359

These arrays additionally include variants that are typically present at lower frequencies. Determining the genotypes of these variants from hybridization intensities is challenging because there is less support to locate the presence of the minor alleles when the allele counts are low. Existing algorithms are mainly designed for calling common variants and are notorious for failing to generate accurate calls for low-frequency and rare variants. Here, we introduce a new calling algorithm, iCall, to call genotypes for variants across the whole spectrum of allele frequencies.Results:We benchmarked iCall against four of the most commonly used algorithms, GenCall, optiCall, illuminus and GenoSNP, as well as a post-processing caller zCall that adopted a two-stage calling design. Normalized hybridization intensities for 12 370 individuals genotyped on the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip were considered, of which 81 individuals were also whole-genome sequenced. The sequence calls were used to benchmark the accuracy of the genotype calling, and our comparisons indicated that iCall outperforms all four single-stage calling algorithms in terms of call rates and concordance, particularly in the calling accuracy of minor alleles, which is the principal concern for rare and low-frequency variants. The application of zCall to post-process the output from iCall also produced marginally improved performance to the combination of zCall and GenCall.Availability and implementation:iCall is implemented in C++ for use on Linux operating systems and is available for download athttp://www.statgen.nus.edu.sg/∼software/icall.html.Contact:statyy@nus.edu.sg,zhoujin@nus.edu.sg	0.0	4	2126	1112	499	2031	1745	0.320363286688	0.258851720318	0.246708977819	0.219764563938	0.414046244709	0.625520333464	-3.04309992797	NULL	-0.289071700767	0.189593648753

MEME is a popular motif discovery algorithm. Unfortunately, MEME’s running time scales poorly with the size of the dataset. Experiments such as ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq are providing a rich amount of information on the binding preference of transcription factors. MEME cannot discover motifs in data from these experiments in a practical amount of time without a compromising strategy such as discarding a majority of the sequences.Results:We present EXTREME, a motif discovery algorithm designed to find DNA-binding motifs in ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data. Unlike MEME, which uses the expectation-maximization algorithm for motif discovery, EXTREME uses the online expectation-maximization algorithm to discover motifs. EXTREME can discover motifs in large datasets in a practical amount of time without discarding any sequences. Using EXTREME on ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data, we discover many motifs, including some novel and infrequent motifs that can only be discovered by using the entire dataset. Conservation analysis of one of these novel infrequent motifs confirms that it is evolutionarily conserved and possibly functional.Availability and implementation:All source code is available at the Github repositoryhttp://github.com/uci-cbcl/EXTREME.Contact:xhx@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2128	2111	959	416	234	0.345646690694	0.342671835382	0.317863967708	0.275401448462	0.582968913084	2.61010331288	1.18123579698	NULL	2.32230496743	-0.0980011685752

Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, RNA-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 × 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makesde novoassembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge.Results:Here, we present SOAPdenovo-Trans, ade novotranscriptome assembler designed specifically for RNA-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how SOAPdenovo-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that SOAPdenovo-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.Availability and implementation:Source code and user manual are available athttp://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovotrans/.Contact:xieyl@genomics.cnorbgi-soap@googlegroups.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	40.0	7	2129	1770	493	913	1305	0.212306583896	0.185627901322	0.184572971302	0.176152068324	-2.4434053971	-1.62319980078	-2.10018570737	NULL	-1.45323243188	-2.66519589869

Despite this unprecedented progress, current tools fail to reliably detect and characterize more complex allelic variants, such as short tandem repeats (STRs). We developed TSSV as an efficient and sensitive tool to specifically profile all allelic variants present in targeted loci. Based on its design, requiring only two short flanking sequences, TSSV can work without the use of a complete reference sequence to reliably profile highly polymorphic, repetitive or uncharacterized regions.Results:We show that TSSV can accurately determine allelic STR structures in mixtures with 10% representation of minor alleles or complex mixtures in which a single STR allele is shared. Furthermore, we show the universal utility of TSSV in two other independent studies: characterizingde novomutations introduced by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and profiling the noise and systematic errors in an IonTorrent sequencing experiment. TSSV complements the existing tools by aiding the study of highly polymorphic and complex regions and provides a high-resolution map that can be used in a wide range of applications, from personal genomics to forensic analysis and clinical diagnostics.Availability and implementation:We have implemented TSSV as a Python package that can be installed through the command-line using pip install TSSV command.

The software, distributed as an R Bioconductor library, is based on a mathematical model that takes into account the height of each peak, the size and position of the parental population (labeled but not proliferating) and the estimated distance between the brightness of a cell and the brightness of its daughter (in which the dye is assumed to undergo a 2-fold dilution). Although the algorithm does not make any inference on cell types, rates of cell divisions or rates of cell death, it deconvolutes the actual collected data into a set of peaks, whereby each peak corresponds to a subpopulation of cells that have divided N times. We validated flowFit by retrospective analysis of published proliferation-tracking experiments and demonstrated that the algorithm predicts the same percentage of cells/generation either in samples with discernible peaks (in which the peaks are visible in the collected raw data) or in samples with non-discernible peaks (in which the peaks are fused together). To the best of our knowledge, flowFit represents the first open-source algorithm in its category and might be applied to numerous areas of cell biology in which quantitative deconvolution of tracking dye-based experiments is desired, including stem cell research.Availability and implementation:http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/flowFit.html(Bioconductor software page).http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/vignettes/flowFit/inst/doc/HowTo-flowFit.pdf(package vignette).http://rpubs.com/tucano/flowFit(online tutorial).Contact:pierpaolo.difiore@ifom.euordavide.rambaldi@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2139	2044	1884	1585	1168	0.239937312603	0.199812708906	0.178870300941	0.178593140377	-1.78539338893	0.505776945118	-0.423311343275	NULL	-0.595787154316	-1.50529844883

Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is theaverage common substring approachthat defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings withkmismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of suchk-mismatch substrings, and we describekmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays.Results:To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of DNA and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated withkmacswere more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods that are based onexactword matches.

2240	http://bioinformatics.rutgers.edu/Software/Turtle	2241	NULL	Turtle	Motivation:Counting the frequencies ofk-mers in read libraries is often a first step in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. Infrequentk-mers are assumed to be a result of sequencing errors. The frequentk-mers constitute a reduced but error-free representation of the experiment, which can inform read error correction or serve as the input tode novoassembly methods. Ideally, the memory requirement for counting should be linear in the number of frequentk-mers and not in the, typically much larger, total number ofk-mers in the read library.Results:We present a novel method that balances time, space and accuracy requirements to efficiently extract frequentk-mers even for high-coverage libraries and large genomes such as human. Our method is designed to minimize cache misses in a cache-efficient manner by using a pattern-blocked Bloom filter to remove infrequentk-mers from consideration in combination with a novel sort-and-compact scheme, instead of a hash, for the actual counting. Although this increases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the empirical running times. A variant of method can resort to a counting Bloom filter for even larger savings in memory at the expense of false-negative rates in addition to the false-positive rates common to all Bloom filter-based approaches. A comparison with the state-of-the-art shows reduced memory requirements and running times.Availability and implementation:The tools are freely available for download athttp://bioinformatics.rutgers.edu/Software/Turtleandhttp://figshare.com/articles/Turtle/791582.Contact:rajatroy@cs.rutgers.eduorschliep@cs.rutgers.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	2142	2326	1204	2235	1538	0.32685726114	0.244652734252	0.216327616888	0.203729230897	3.17339787033	-0.345102936811	-2.32005450137	NULL	-0.0108832506107	-3.10948059371

PRADA uses a dual-mapping strategy that increases sensitivity and refines the analytical endpoints. PRADA has been used extensively and successfully in the glioblastoma and renal clear cell projects of The Cancer Genome Atlas program.Availability and implementation:http://sourceforge.net/projects/prada/Contact:gadgetz@broadinstitute.orgorrverhaak@mdanderson.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	9.0	6	2146	692	2376	672	612	0.265627491078	0.235582695794	0.214966033062	0.200203826196	-1.0065097663	-2.27548733527	-3.10725256831	NULL	-2.29292820979	-2.14557593985
2245	http://proqm.wallnerlab.org/download/	2246	NULL	ProQM-resample	Summary:Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are used to predict the quality of modeled protein structures. These usually use two approaches: methods using consensus of many alternative models and methods requiring only a single model to do its prediction. The consensus methods are useful to improve overall accuracy; however, they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model and cannot be used to generate and score new structures. Single-model methods, on the other hand, do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used to both sample new structures and improve existing consensus methods. Here, we presentProQM-resample, a membrane protein-specific single-model MQAP, that couples side-chain resampling with MQAP rescoring by ProQM to improve model selection. The side-chain resampling is able to improve side-chain packing for 96% of all models, and improve model selection by 24% as measured by the sum of the Z-score for the first-ranked model (from 25.0 to 31.1), even better than the state-of-the-art consensus method Pcons. The improved model selection can be attributed to the improved side-chain quality, which enables the MQAP to rescue good backbone models with poor side-chain packing.Availability and implementation:http://proqm.wallnerlab.org/download/.Contact:bjornw@ifm.liu.seSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2147	1698	431	1727	280	0.416270142839	0.222467969794	0.212223343414	0.210879879869	-0.560281748841	0.909227694298	3.2946196481	NULL	2.01270338735	-1.34206629263
2246	http://www.nmr-relax.com	2247	NULL	relax	Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool for observing the motion of biomolecules at the atomic level. One technique, the analysis of relaxation dispersion phenomenon, is highly suited for studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of biological processes. Built on top of the relax computational environment for NMR dynamics is a new dispersion analysis designed to be comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use. The software supports more models, both numeric and analytic, than current solutions. An automated protocol, available for scripting and driving the graphical user interface (GUI), is designed to simplify the analysis of dispersion data for NMR spectroscopists. Decreases in optimization time are granted by parallelization for running on computer clusters and by skipping an initial grid search by using parameters from one solution as the starting point for another —using analytic model results for the numeric models, taking advantage of model nesting, and using averaged non-clustered results for the clustered analysis.Availability and implementation:The software relax is written in Python with C modules and is released under the GPLv3+ license.

In this work, we evaluate CABS-flex and MD predictions by comparison with protein structural variations within NMR ensembles.Results:Based on a benchmark set of 140 proteins, we show that the relative fluctuations of protein residues obtained from CABS-flex are well correlated to those of NMR ensembles. On average, this correlation is stronger than that between MD and NMR ensembles.

2252	http://www.ibt.lt/bioinformatics/models/hhv1_ul8/	2253	NULL	UL8	Motivation:Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses causing a variety of diseases in humans and animals. To develop effective treatment, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their replication. One of the components of the herpesviral DNA replication system is a helicase–primase complex, consisting of UL5 (helicase), UL52 (primase) and UL8. UL8 is an essential herpesviral protein involved in multiple protein–protein interactions. Intriguingly, so far no UL8 homologs outside of herpesviruses could be identified. Moreover, nothing is known about its structure or domain organization.Results:Here, combining sensitive homology detection methods and homology modeling, we found that the UL8 protein family is related to B-family polymerases. In the course of evolution, UL8 has lost the active site and has undergone a reduction of DNA-binding motifs. The loss of active site residues explains the failure to detect any catalytic activity of UL8. A structural model of human herpes virus 1 UL8 constructed as part of the study is consistent with the mutation data targeting its interaction with primase UL52. It also provides a platform for studying multiple interactions that UL8 is involved in. The two other components of helicase–primase complex show evolutionary links with a newly characterized human primase that also has DNA polymerase activity (PrimPol) and the Pif1 helicase, respectively. The role of these enzymes in recovering stalled replication forks suggests mechanistic and functional similarities with herpesviral proteins.Contact:venclovas@ibt.ltSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2154	614	406	479	1341	0.126686277833	0.12191668649	0.10223818764	0.0977578698457	-2.12912577131	1.5354743778	1.39004517876	NULL	2.77721555789	0.444907038272

Due to its importance in regulating oxidative/nitrosative stress and balance in cellular response, a number of methods have been rapidly developed to studyS-glutathionylation, thus expanding the dataset of experimentally determined glutathionylation sites. However, there is currently no database dedicated to the integration of all experimentally verifiedS-glutathionylation sites along with their characteristics or structural or functional information. Thus, the dbGSH database has been created to integrate all available datasets and to provide the relevant structural analysis. As of January 31, 2014, dbGSH has manually collected >2200 experimentally verifiedS-glutathionylated peptides from 169 research articles using a text-mining approach. To solve the problem of heterogeneity of the data collected from different sources, the sequence identity of the reportedS-glutathionylated peptides is mapped to UniProtKB protein entries. To delineate the structural correlations and consensus motifs of theseS-glutathionylation sites, the dbGSH database also provides structural and functional analyses, including the motifs of substrate sites, solvent accessibility, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein domains and gene ontology.Availability and implementation:dbGSH is now freely accessible athttp://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/dbGSH/.

2257	http://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/EnsembleGASVR/dataset-codes.zip	2258	NULL	EnsembleGASVR	Motivation:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered the most frequently occurring DNA sequence variations. Several computational methods have been proposed for the classification of missense SNPs to neutral and disease associated. However, existing computational approaches fail to select relevant features by choosing them arbitrarily without sufficient documentation. Moreover, they are limited to the problem of missing values, imbalance between the learning datasets and most of them do not support their predictions with confidence scores.Results:To overcome these limitations, a novel ensemble computational methodology is proposed. EnsembleGASVR facilitates a two-step algorithm, which in its first step applies a novel evolutionary embedded algorithm to locate close to optimal Support Vector Regression models. In its second step, these models are combined to extract a universal predictor, which is less prone to overfitting issues, systematizes the rebalancing of the learning sets and uses an internal approach for solving the missing values problem without loss of information. Confidence scores support all the predictions and the model becomes tunable by modifying the classification thresholds. An extensive study was performed for collecting the most relevant features for the problem of classifying SNPs, and a superset of 88 features was constructed. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms well-known algorithms in terms of classification performance in the examined datasets. Finally, the proposed algorithmic framework was able to uncover the significant role of certain features such as the solvent accessibility feature, and the top-scored predictions were further validated by linking them with disease phenotypes.Availability and implementation:Datasets and codes are freely available on the Web athttp://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/EnsembleGASVR/dataset-codes.zip.

The target enrichment process that is intrinsic to exome sequencing is inherently imperfect, generating large amounts of unintended off-target sequence. Off-target data are characterized by very low and highly heterogeneous coverage and are usually discarded by exome analysis pipelines. We posit that off-target read depth is a rich, but overlooked, source of information that could be mined to detect intergenic copy number variation (CNV). We propose cnvOffseq, a novel normalization framework for off-target read depth that is based on local adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). This method is designed to address the heterogeneity of the underlying data and allows for accurate and precise CNV detection and genotyping in off-target regions.Results:cnvOffSeq was benchmarked on whole-exome sequencing samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In a set of 104 gold standard intergenic deletions, our method achieved a sensitivity of 57.5% and a specificity of 99.2%, while maintaining a low FDR of 5%. For gold standard deletions longer than 5 kb, cnvOffSeq achieves a sensitivity of 90.4% without increasing the FDR. cnvOffSeq outperforms both whole-genome and whole-exome CNV detection methods considerably and is shown to offer a substantial improvement over naïve local SVD.Availability and Implementation:cnvOffSeq is available athttp://sourceforge.net/p/cnvoffseq/Contact:evangelos.bellos09@imperial.ac.ukorl.coin@imb.uq.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2160	1000	2180	1392	2348	0.252119564557	0.178489431091	0.17406380856	0.171029097502	0.872284030722	1.37025531787	-4.07377755532	NULL	-1.45574566214	-0.673486332484

Yet, gene trees often differ from species trees, creating challenges to species tree estimation. One of the most frequent causes for conflicting topologies between gene trees and species trees is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which is modelled by the multi-species coalescent. While many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from multiple genes, some which have statistical guarantees under the multi-species coalescent model, existing methods are too computationally intensive for use with genome-scale analyses or have been shown to have poor accuracy under some realistic conditions.Results:We present ASTRAL, a fast method for estimating species trees from multiple genes. ASTRAL is statistically consistent, can run on datasets with thousands of genes and has outstanding accuracy—improving on MP-EST and the population tree from BUCKy, two statistically consistent leading coalescent-based methods.

The study of PPI networks, such as comparative analysis, shall benefit the understanding of life process and diseases at the molecular level. One way of comparative analysis is to align PPI networks to identify conserved or species-specific subnetwork motifs. A few methods have been developed for global PPI network alignment, but it still remains challenging in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.Results:This paper presents a novel global network alignment algorithm, denoted as HubAlign, that makes use of both network topology and sequence homology information, based upon the observation that topologically important proteins in a PPI network usually are much more conserved and thus, more likely to be aligned. HubAlign uses a minimum-degree heuristic algorithm to estimate the topological and functional importance of a protein from the global network topology information. Then HubAlign aligns topologically important proteins first and gradually extends the alignment to the whole network. Extensive tests indicate that HubAlign greatly outperforms several popular methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting functionally similar proteins.Availability:HubAlign is available freely for non-commercial purposes athttp://ttic.uchicago.edu/∼hashemifar/software/HubAlign.zipContact:jinboxu@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	2162	1826	1689	1695	1970	0.346217141405	0.332955880843	0.323406294593	0.272701905601	1.10243810377	0.436328643703	2.86270048665	NULL	1.61778970584	2.51933135574

These approaches work well for transcription factors, but histone modifications often occur over broad domains, and across multiple genes.Results:To incorporate the unique properties of broad domains into functional enrichment testing, we developed Broad-Enrich, a method that uses the proportion of each gene’s locus covered by a peak. We show that our method has a well-calibrated false-positive rate, performing well with ChIP-seq data having broad domains compared with alternative approaches. We illustrate Broad-Enrich with 55 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets using different methods to define gene loci. Broad-Enrich can also be applied to other datasets consisting of broad genomic domains such as copy number variations.Availability and implementation:http://broad-enrich.med.umich.edufor Web version and R package.Contact:sartorma@umich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2163	2317	1207	1984	1082	0.404617921738	0.253016139579	0.235097748545	0.232467320005	-0.478509358734	3.10793056528	-0.346063717486	NULL	-0.700729432131	-0.669889767133

In particular, RNA is an ideal substrate tode novodesign regulators of protein expression by following sequence-to-function models.Results:We have implemented a novel algorithm, RiboMaker, aimed at the computational, automated design of bacterial riboregulation. RiboMaker reads the sequence and structure specifications, which codify for a gene regulatory behaviour, and optimizes the sequences of a small regulatory RNA and a 5′-untranslated region for an efficient intermolecular interaction. To this end, it implements an evolutionary design strategy, where random mutations are selected according to a physicochemical model based on free energies.

A comprehensive resource on lncRNA function is an immediate need.Results:We present a database for functional investigation of lncRNAs that encompasses annotation, sequence analysis, gene expression, protein binding and phylogenetic conservation. We have compiled lncRNAs for six species (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm and yeast) from ENSEMBL, HGNC, MGI and lncRNAdb. Each lncRNA was analyzed for coding potential and phylogenetic conservation in different lineages. Gene expression data of 208 RNA-Seq studies (4995 samples), collected from GEO, ENCODE, modENCODE and TCGA databases, were used to provide expression profiles in various tissues, diseases and developmental stages. Importantly, we analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed mRNAs that would provide ample insights on lncRNA functions. The resulting gene list can be subject to enrichment analysis such as Gene Ontology or KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we compiled protein–lncRNA interactions by collecting and analyzing publicly available CLIP-seq or PAR-CLIP sequencing data. Finally, we explored evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs with correlated expression between human and six other organisms to identify functional lncRNAs.

2274	http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLink	2275	NULL	PeakLink	Motivation:In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), it is necessary to link tandem MS-identified peptide peaks so that protein expression changes between the two runs can be tracked. However, only a small number of peptides can be identified and linked by tandem MS in two runs, and it becomes necessary to link peptide peaks with tandem identification in one run to their corresponding ones in another run without identification. In the past, peptide peaks are linked based on similarities in retention time (rt), mass or peak shape afterrtalignment, which corrects meanrtshifts between runs. However, the accuracy in linking is still limited especially for complex samples collected from different conditions. Consequently, large-scale proteomics studies that require comparison of protein expression profiles of hundreds of patients can not be carried out effectively.Method:In this article, we consider the problem of linking peptides from a pair of LC-MS/MS runs and propose a new method, PeakLink (PL), which uses information in both the time and frequency domain as inputs to a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. ThePLalgorithm first uses a threshold on anrtlikelihood ratio score to remove candidate corresponding peaks with excessively large elution time shifts, thenPLcalculates the correlation between a pair of candidate peaks after reducing noise through wavelet transformation. After convertingrtand peak shape correlation to statistical scores, an SVM classifier is trained and applied for differentiating corresponding and non-corresponding peptide peaks.Results:PLis tested in multiple challenging cases, in which LC-MS/MS samples are collected from different disease states, different instruments and different laboratories. Testing results show significant improvement in linking accuracy compared with other algorithms.Availability and implementation:M files for the PL alignment method are available athttp://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLinkContact:Michelle.Zhang@utsa.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary Dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2175	1718	2217	2089	911	0.316950257736	0.303617950282	0.249211147823	0.215931435812	-2.07059367886	-0.638538630186	0.966970382745	NULL	-0.881408063025	1.6042280328

As a consequence, today’s protein databases contain a huge amount of inconsistency, due to both natural variants and sequence prediction errors.Results:We have developed a new method, called SIBIS, to detect such inconsistencies based on the evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments. A Bayesian framework, combined with Dirichlet mixture models, is used to estimate the probability of observing specific amino acids and to detect inconsistent or erroneous sequence segments. We evaluated the performance of SIBIS on a reference set of protein sequences with experimentally validated errors and showed that the sensitivity is significantly higher than previous methods, with only a small loss of specificity. We also assessed a large set of human sequences from the UniProt database and found evidence of inconsistency in 48% of the previously uncharacterized sequences. We conclude that the integration of quality control methods like SIBIS in automatic analysis pipelines will be critical for the robust inference of structural, functional and phylogenetic information from these sequences.Availability and implementation:Source code, implemented in C on a linux system, and the datasets of protein sequences are freely available for download athttp://www.lbgi.fr/∼julie/SIBIS.Contact:thompson@unistra.fr	0.0	4	2176	678	1821	1451	22	0.180362519093	0.170621736182	0.157269006962	0.156017685265	-1.30120687382	0.494384548192	1.24830050945	NULL	0.778315270595	-0.881550788994

New logistic and SVM-derived models enablein silicopredictions of assay success, and assay redesign exhibits improved coverage uniformity relative to previous methods, which in turn improves the utility of MIPs for cost-effective targeted sequencing for candidate gene validation and for diagnostic sequencing in a clinical setting.Availability and implementation:MIPgen is implemented in C++.

Currently, we offer models for SH2, SH3 and PDZ domains via the tools SH2PepInt, SH3PepInt and PDZPepInt, respectively. More specifically, our server offers predictions for 51 SH2 human domains and 69 SH3 human domains via single domain models, and predictions for 226 PDZ domains across several species, via 43 multidomain models. All models are based on support vector machines with different kernel functions ranging from polynomial, to Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this way, we model non-linear interactions between amino acid residues.

However, a large fraction of the most enriched aptamers in Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) rounds display poor binding activity. Here, we present MPBind, aMeta-motif-based statistical framework and pipeline toPredict theBinding potential of SELEX-derived aptamers. Using human embryonic stem cell SELEX-Seq data, MPBind achieved high prediction accuracy for binding potential. Further analysis showed that MPBind is robust to both polymerase chain reaction amplification bias and incomplete sequencing of aptamer pools.

Mirsynergy operates in two stages: it first forms MiRMs based on co-occurring microRNA (miRNA) targets and then expands each MiRM by greedily including (excluding) mRNAs into (from) the MiRM to maximize the synergy score, which is a function of miRNA–mRNA and gene–gene interactions. Using expression data for ovarian, breast and thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared Mirsynergy with internal controls and existing methods. Mirsynergy-MiRMs exhibit significantly higher functional enrichment and more coherent miRNA–mRNA expression anti-correlation.

However, tools that can perform group comparisons are currently lacking.Results:We present a peak-calling prioritization pipeline (PePr) for identifying consistent or differential binding sites in ChIP-Seq experiments with biological replicates. PePr models read counts across the genome among biological samples with a negative binomial distribution and uses a local variance estimation method, ranking consistent or differential binding sites more favorably than sites with greater variability. We compared PePr with commonly used and recently proposed approaches on eight TF datasets and show that PePr uniquely identifies consistent regions with enriched read counts, high motif occurrence rate and known characteristics of TF binding based on visual inspection. For histone modification data with broadly enriched regions, PePr identified differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperformed other methods in scaling False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis.Availability and implementation:http://code.google.com/p/pepr-chip-seq/.Contact:sartorma@umich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	5	2189	2163	1207	2028	1804	0.224464112826	0.216948449777	0.196688440489	0.194734151133	-0.340862391146	3.12336538335	-0.147622902118	NULL	-0.24996140831	-0.732512312044

This enables the lipidome of large cohorts of subjects to be profiled to identify lipid biomarkers significantly associated with disease risk, progression and treatment response. Clinically, these lipid biomarkers can be used to construct classification models for the purpose of disease screening or diagnosis. However, the inclusion of a large number of highly correlated biomarkers within a model may reduce classification performance, unnecessarily inflate associated costs of a diagnosis or a screen and reduce the feasibility of clinical translation. An unsupervised feature reduction approach can reduce feature redundancy in lipidomic biomarkers by limiting the number of highly correlated lipids while retaining informative features to achieve good classification performance for various clinical outcomes. Good predictive models based on a reduced number of biomarkers are also more cost effective and feasible from a clinical translation perspective.Results:The application ofLICREto various lipidomic datasets in diabetes and cardiovascular disease demonstrated superior discrimination in terms of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve while using fewer lipid markers when predicting various clinical outcomes.Availability and implementation:The MATLAB implementation ofLICREis available fromhttps://sites.google.com/site/licrerepository/Contact:gerard.wong@bakeridi.edu.auorgerard.wong@unimelb.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2191	2017	2027	2383	1553	0.285333523049	0.278734839165	0.252951321535	0.235226232419	-2.71324269029	3.10608298613	0.952315037581	NULL	0.3854876986	-1.3037437356

Commonly used NGS-variant analysis tools generally rely on accurately mapped short reads to identify somatic variants and germ-line genotypes. Existing NGS read mappers have difficulty accurately mapping short reads containing complex variation (i.e. more than a single base change), thus making identification of such variants difficult or impossible. Insertions and deletions (indels) in particular have been an area of great difficulty. Indels are frequent and can have substantial impact on function, which makes their detection all the more imperative.Results:We present ABRA, an assembly-based realigner, which uses an efficient and flexible localizedde novoassembly followed by global realignment to more accurately remap reads.

However, the commonly used univariate association testing or the site-by-site (SBS) testing may underutilize the longitudinal feature of the data, leading to underpowered results and less biologically meaningful results.Results:We propose a penalized regression model incorporating grid search method (PGS), for analyzing associations of high-dimensional miRNA expression data with repeated measures. The development of this analytical framework was motivated by a real-world miRNA dataset. Comparisons between PGS and the SBS testing revealed that PGS provided smaller phenotype prediction errors and higher enrichment of phenotype-related biological pathways than the SBS testing.

2296	http://www.bioinformatics.csiro.au/Blue	2297	NULL	Blue	Motivation:Bioinformatics tools, such as assemblers and aligners, are expected to produce more accurate results when given better quality sequence data as their starting point. This expectation has led to the development of stand-alone tools whose sole purpose is to detect and remove sequencing errors. A good error-correcting tool would be a transparent component in a bioinformatics pipeline, simply taking sequence data in any of the standard formats and producing a higher quality version of the same data containing far fewer errors. It should not only be able to correct all of the types of errors found in real sequence data (substitutions, insertions, deletions and uncalled bases), but it has to be both fast enough and scalable enough to be usable on the large datasets being produced by current sequencing technologies, and work on data derived from both haploid and diploid organisms.Results:This article presents Blue, an error-correction algorithm based on k-mer consensus and context. Blue can correct substitution, deletion and insertion errors, as well as uncalled bases. It accepts both FASTQ and FASTA formats, and corrects quality scores for corrected bases. Blue also maintains the pairing of reads, both within a file and between pairs of files, making it compatible with downstream tools that depend on read pairing. Blue is memory efficient, scalable and faster than other published tools, and usable on large sequencing datasets. On the tests undertaken, Blue also proved to be generally more accurate than other published algorithms, resulting in more accurately aligned reads and the assembly of longer contigs containing fewer errors. One significant feature of Blue is that its k-mer consensus table does not have to be derived from the set of reads being corrected. This decoupling makes it possible to correct one dataset, such as small set of 454 mate-pair reads, with the consensus derived from another dataset, such as Illumina reads derived from the same DNA sample. Such cross-correction can greatly improve the quality of small (and expensive) sets of long reads, leading to even better assemblies and higher quality finished genomes.Availability and implementation:The code for Blue and its related tools are available fromhttp://www.bioinformatics.csiro.au/Blue.

Omega (overlap-graphmetagenomeassembler) was developed for assembling and scaffolding Illumina sequencing data of microbial communities.Results: Omega found overlaps between reads using a prefix/suffix hash table.

Unitigs were generated based on minimum cost flow analysis of the overlap graph and then merged to contigs and scaffolds using mate-pair information. In comparison with three de Bruijn graph assemblers (SOAPdenovo, IDBA-UD and MetaVelvet), Omega provided comparable overall performance on a HiSeq 100-bp dataset and superior performance on a MiSeq 300-bp dataset. In comparison with Celera on the MiSeq dataset, Omega provided more continuous assemblies overall using a fraction of the computing time of existing overlap-layout-consensus assemblers. This indicates Omega can more efficiently assemble longer Illumina reads, and at deeper coverage, for metagenomic datasets.Availability and implementation: Implemented in C++ with source code and binaries freely available athttp://omega.omicsbio.org.Contact:panc@ornl.govSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	5	2198	627	488	747	913	0.253202094896	0.223971649915	0.153357770985	0.148603923847	1.00904996962	-1.27576567445	-2.80650443662	NULL	-0.515971762551	-2.7718299868

Manual intervention and/or programming skills by the user is required at each intermediate point, as Affymetrix Power Tools programs do not produce input files for the program next-in-line. An additional problem is that the output format of genotypes is not compatible with most analysis software currently available. AffyPipe solves all the above problems, by automating both standard and ‘best practice’ workflows for any species genotyped with the Axiom technology.

2306	https://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver.git	2307	NULL	e-Driver	Motivation:Most approaches used to identify cancer driver genes focus, true to their name, on entire genes and assume that a gene, treated as one entity, has a specific role in cancer. This approach may be correct to describe effects of gene loss or changes in gene expression; however, mutations may have different effects, including their relevance to cancer, depending on which region of the gene they affect. Except for rare and well-known exceptions, there are not enough data for reliable statistics for individual positions, but an intermediate level of analysis, between an individual position and the entire gene, may give us better statistics than the former and better resolution than the latter approach.Results:We have developed e-Driver, a method that exploits the internal distribution of somatic missense mutations between the protein’s functional regions (domains or intrinsically disordered regions) to find those that show a bias in their mutation rate as compared with other regions of the same protein, providing evidence of positive selection and suggesting that these proteins may be actual cancer drivers. We have applied e-Driver to a large cancer genome dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared its performance with that of four other methods, showing that e-Driver identifies novel candidate cancer drivers and, because of its increased resolution, provides deeper insights into the potential mechanism of cancer driver genes identified by other methods.Availability and implementation:A Perl script with e-Driver and the files to reproduce the results described here can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver.gitContact:adam@godziklab.orgoreppardo@sanfordburnham.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	4	2207	1306	1704	1701	1158	0.374931358584	0.221425224099	0.211721515118	0.197978269543	-2.0927225549	0.861160271191	-1.57820946347	NULL	-2.2922812744	-0.613441316584

This, in turn, is leading to a compelling need for new methods for compression and fast retrieval of SNP data.Results:We present a novel algorithm and file format for compressing and retrieving SNP data, specifically designed for large-scale association studies. Our algorithm is based on two main ideas: (i) compress linkage disequilibrium blocks in terms of differences with a reference SNP and (ii) compress reference SNPs exploiting information on their call rate and minor allele frequency.

Many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature, but in practice simpler algorithms are often used. However, few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated.Results: We give a precise definition of a popular simple method we refer to as más-o-menos, which calculates prognostic scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors, weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome. We study its behavior theoretically, in simulations and in an extensive analysis of 27 independent gene expression studies of bladder, breast and ovarian cancer, altogether totaling 3833 patients with survival outcomes.

It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.Availability and implementation:The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the apLCMS package available athttp://web1.sph.emory.edu/apLCMS/Contact:tyu8@emory.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	2217	2175	1718	2353	2089	0.303617950282	0.24710608049	0.224832302113	0.223088090735	-1.80806288225	-0.720153334628	0.814453513317	NULL	-1.17559361057	1.49462792671
2318	http://nd.edu/~cone/MAGNA	2319	NULL	MAGNA	Motivation: Biological network alignment aims to identify similar regions between networks of different species. Existing methods compute node similarities to rapidly identify from possible alignments the high-scoring alignments with respect to the overall node similarity. But, the accuracy of the alignments is then evaluated with some other measure that is different than the node similarity used to construct the alignments. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges. Thus, the existing methods align similarnodesbetween networks hoping to conserve manyedges(afterthe alignment is constructed!).Results: Instead, we introduce MAGNA to directly ‘optimize’ edge conservationwhilethe alignment is constructed, without decreasing the quality of node mapping. MAGNA uses a genetic algorithm and our novel function for ‘crossover’ of two ‘parent’ alignments into a superior ‘child’ alignment to simulate a ‘population’ of alignments that ‘evolves’ over time; the ‘fittest’ alignments survive and proceed to the next ‘generation’, until the alignment accuracy cannot be optimized further. While we optimize our new and superior measure of the amount of conserved edges, MAGNA can optimize any alignment accuracy measure, including a combined measure of both node and edge conservation. In systematic evaluations against state-of-the-art methods (IsoRank, MI-GRAAL and GHOST), on both synthetic networks and real-world biological data, MAGNA outperforms all of the existing methods, in terms of both node and edge conservation as well as both topological and biological alignment accuracy.Availability: Software:http://nd.edu/∼cone/MAGNAContact:tmilenko@nd.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	5.0	5	2218	1977	999	592	1689	0.658710161329	0.290810678738	0.27729150054	0.270003961492	2.10636817581	-0.689721968384	1.93934511967	NULL	1.41771871572	-0.730318348565

ROHs can be relevant for population and medical genetics, playing a role in predisposition to both rare and common disorders. ROHs are commonly detected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, but attempts have been made to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Currently available methods developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced SNP-array maps do not fit easily to the analysis of the sparse and non-uniform distribution of the WES target design.Results:To meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to WES data, we developedH3M2H3M2H3M2, an original algorithm based on heterogeneous hidden Markov model that incorporates inter-marker distances to detect ROH from WES data. We evaluated the performance ofH3M2H3M2H3M2to correctly identify ROHs on synthetic chromosomes and examined its accuracy in detecting ROHs of different length (short, medium and long) from real 1000 genomes project data.H3M2H3M2H3M2turned out to be more accurate than GERMLINE and PLINK, two state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in the detection of short and medium ROHs.Availability and implementation:H3M2H3M2H3M2is a collection of bash, R and Fortran scripts and codes and is freely available athttps://sourceforge.net/projects/h3m2/.Contact:albertomagi@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	5	2219	2265	1160	1359	2303	0.21926669389	0.178808676022	0.156265350722	0.127521332164	-0.434897492665	2.67798582538	-3.20054828847	NULL	0.0926472725666	-1.27637402653

The bit-parallel approach represents individual cells in an alignment scoring matrix as bits in computer words and emulates the calculation of scores by a series of logic operations composed of AND, OR, XOR, complement, shift and addition. Bit-parallelism has been successfully applied to the longest common subsequence (LCS) and edit-distance problems, producing fast algorithms in practice.Results:We have developed BitPAl, a bit-parallel algorithm for general, integer-scoring global alignment. Integer-scoring schemes assign integer weights for match, mismatch and insertion/deletion. The BitPAl method uses structural properties in the relationship between adjacent scores in the scoring matrix to construct classes of efficient algorithms, each designed for a particular set of weights.

Currently, quality control of 450k data can be performed with Illumina’s GenomeStudio and is part of a limited number 450k analysis pipelines. However, GenomeStudio cannot handle large-scale studies, and existing pipelines provide limited options for quality control and neither support interactive exploration by the user.To aid the detection of bad-quality samples in large-scale genome-wide DNA methylation studies as flexible and transparent as possible, we have developed MethylAid; a visual and interactive Web application using RStudio’s shiny package. Bad-quality samples are detected using sample-dependent and sample-independent quality control probes present on the array and user-adjustable thresholds. In-depth exploration of bad-quality samples can be performed using several interactive diagnostic plots. Furthermore, plots can be annotated with user-provided metadata, for example, to identify outlying batches. Our new tool makes quality assessment of 450k array data interactive, flexible and efficient and is, therefore, expected to be useful for both data analysts and core facilities.Availability and implementation:MethylAid is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package (www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.0/bioc/html/MethylAid.html).

However, reliable variant identification from RNA-seq data remains challenging because of the complexities of the transcriptome, the challenges of accurately mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the bias introduced during the sequencing library preparation.Method:We developed RVboost, a novel method specific for RNA variant prioritization. RVboost uses several attributes unique in the process of RNA library preparation, sequencing and RNA-seq data analyses. It uses a boosting method to train a model of ‘good quality’ variants using common variants from HapMap, and prioritizes and calls the RNA variants based on the trained model. We packaged RVboost in a comprehensive workflow, which integrates tools of variant calling, annotation and filtering.Results: RVboost consistently outperforms the variant quality score recalibration from the Genome Analysis Tool Kit and the RNA-seq variant-calling pipeline SNPiR in 12 RNA-seq samples using ground-truth variants from paired exome sequencing data. Several RNA-seq–specific attributes were identified as critical to differentiate true and false variants, including the distance of the variant positions to exon boundaries, and the percent of the reads supporting the variant in the first six base pairs. The latter identifies false variants introduced by the random hexamer priming during the library construction.Availability and implementation:The RVboost package is implemented to readily run in Mac or Linux environments.

Conventional approaches, such as mean shortest path and clique-based metrics, have been useful but are not well suited to all applications.

More specifically, this requires accurate detection of somatic point mutations with low allele frequencies in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples. Although haplotype phasing information derived by using heterozygous germ line variants near candidate mutations would improve accuracy, no somatic mutation caller that uses such information is currently available.Results:We propose a Bayesian hierarchical method, termed HapMuC, in which power is increased by using available information on heterozygous germ line variants located near candidate mutations. We first constructed two generative models (the mutation model and the error model). In the generative models, we prepared candidate haplotypes, considering a heterozygous germ line variant if available, and the observed reads were realigned to the haplotypes. We then inferred the haplotype frequencies and computed the marginal likelihoods using a variational Bayesian algorithm. Finally, we derived a Bayes factor for evaluating the possibility of the existence of somatic mutations.

Application of the fixed or random effects model to single-marker association tests is a standard practice. More complex methods of meta-analysis involving multiple parameters have not been used frequently, a gap that could be explained by the lack of a respective meta-analysis pipeline. Meta-analysis based on combiningp-values can be applied to any association test. However, to be powerful, meta-analysis methods for high-dimensional models should incorporate additional information such as study-specific properties of parameter estimates, their effect directions, standard errors and covariance structure.Results: We modified ‘method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes’ recently proposed in the educational sciences to the case of multiple logistic regression, and implemented it in a meta-analysis tool called METAINTER. The software handles models with an arbitrary number of parameters, and can directly be applied to analyze the results of single-SNP tests, global haplotype tests, tests for and under gene–gene or gene–environment interaction. Via simulations for two-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) models we have shown that the proposed meta-analysis method has correct type I error rate. Moreover, power estimates come close to that of the joint analysis of the entire sample. We conducted a real data analysis of six GWAS of type 2 diabetes, available from dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). For each study, a genome-wide interaction analysis of all SNP pairs was performed by logistic regression tests.

Unfortunately, when administered to human patients, xenogeneic antibodies can elicit unwanted and dangerous immunogenic responses. Antibody humanization methods are designed to produce molecules with a better safety profile still maintaining their ability to bind the antigen. This can be accomplished by grafting the non-human regions determining the antigen specificity into a suitable human template. Unfortunately, this procedure may results in a partial or complete loss of affinity of the grafted molecule that can be restored by back-mutating some of the residues of human origin to the corresponding murine ones. This trial-and-error procedure is hard and involves expensive and time-consuming experiments. Here we present tools for antibody humanization (Tabhu) a web server for antibody humanization.

2372	http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plsRcox/index.html	2373	NULL	PLS	Motivation: A vast literature from the past decade is devoted to relating gene profiles and subject survival or time to cancer recurrence. Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data, such as transcriptomic or single nucleotide polymorphism profiles, is a major challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses. The proportional hazard regression model suggested by Cox (1972), to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data. However, like multivariate regression, it supposes that more observations than variables, complete data, and not strongly correlated variables are available. In practice, when dealing with high-dimensional data, these constraints are crippling. Collinearity gives rise to issues of over-fitting and model misidentification. Variable selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation. To deal with both collinearity and variable selection issues, many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional hazards have been proposed since the reference paper of Tibshirani. Regularization could also be performed using dimension reduction as is the case with partial least squares (PLS) regression. We propose two original algorithms named sPLSDR and its non-linear kernel counterpart DKsPLSDR, by using sparse PLS regression (sPLS) based on deviance residuals. We compared their predicting performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark datasets.Results: sPLSDR and DKsPLSDR compare favorably with other methods in their computational time, prediction and selectivity, as indicated by results based on benchmark datasets. Moreover, in the framework of PLS regression, they feature other useful tools, including biplots representation, or the ability to deal with missing data. Therefore, we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction methods for the widely used Cox’s model in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings.Availability and implementation: The R-package plsRcox is available on the CRAN and is maintained by Frédéric Bertrand.http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plsRcox/index.html.Contact:pbastien@rd.loreal.comorfbertran@math.unistra.fr.Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2272	1140	2058	870	2259	0.19940715746	0.195509747239	0.12492644656	0.124525340685	-1.21424433942	1.16667823736	-1.11161280449	NULL	-1.93475729265	0.39402823092
2373	http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick	2374	NULL	PhosphoPICK	Motivation:The determinants of kinase-substrate phosphorylation can be found both in the substrate sequence and the surrounding cellular context. Cell cycle progression, interactions with mediating proteins and even prior phosphorylation events are necessary for kinases to maintain substrate specificity. While much work has focussed on the use of sequence-based methods to predict phosphorylation sites, there has been very little work invested into the application of systems biology to understand phosphorylation. Lack of specificity in many kinase substrate binding motifs means that sequence methods for predicting kinase binding sites are susceptible to high false-positive rates.Results:We present here a model that takes into account protein–protein interaction information, and protein abundance data across the cell cycle to predict kinase substrates for 59 human kinases that are representative of important biological pathways. The model shows high accuracy for substrate prediction (with an average AUC of 0.86) across the 59 kinases tested. When using the model to complement sequence-based kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction, we found that the additional information increased prediction performance for most comparisons made, particularly on kinases from the CMGC family. We then used our model to identify functional overlaps between predicted CDK2 substrates and targets from the E2F family of transcription factors. Our results demonstrate that a model harnessing context data can account for the short-falls in sequence information and provide a robust description of the cellular events that regulate protein phosphorylation.Availability and implementation:The method is freely available online as a web server at the websitehttp://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick.Contact:m.boden@uq.edu.auSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2273	1521	1015	1576	1610	0.703336524965	0.57572103876	0.507134870818	0.41173941241	0.603289825457	2.60010565891	2.47836105198	NULL	3.07792092683	0.458249547079
2374	https://code.google.com/p/localali/	2375	NULL	LocalAli	Motivation:Sequences and protein interaction data are of significance to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of organisms. Local network alignment is one of key systematic ways for predicting protein functions, identifying functional modules and understanding the phylogeny from these data. Most of currently existing tools, however, encounter their limitations, which are mainly concerned with scoring scheme, speed and scalability. Therefore, there are growing demands for sophisticated network evolution models and efficient local alignment algorithms.Results:We developed a fast and scalable local network alignment tool called LocalAli for the identification of functionally conserved modules in multiple networks. In this algorithm, we firstly proposed a new framework to reconstruct the evolution history of conserved modules based on a maximum-parsimony evolutionary model. By relying on this model, LocalAli facilitates interpretation of resulting local alignments in terms of conserved modules, which have been evolved from a common ancestral module through a series of evolutionary events. A meta-heuristic method simulated annealing was used to search for the optimal or near-optimal inner nodes (i.e. ancestral modules) of the evolutionary tree. To evaluate the performance and the statistical significance, LocalAli were tested on 26 real datasets and 1040 randomly generated datasets. The results suggest that LocalAli outperforms all existing algorithms in terms of coverage, consistency and scalability, meanwhile retains a high precision in the identification of functionally coherent subnetworks.Availability:The source code and test datasets are freely available for download under the GNU GPL v3 license athttps://code.google.com/p/localali/.Contact:jialu.hu@fu-berlin.deorknut.reinert@fu-berlin.de.Supplementary information:Supplementary dataare available at Bioinformatics online.	1.0	4	2274	2404	1411	1826	1689	0.301005450023	0.259923362316	0.228305199139	0.201421602891	0.979998146592	0.406594029727	3.0053301234	NULL	1.6820217233	2.37868904935

2388	http://info.mcmaster.ca/yifei/FuncPatch	2389	NULL	FuncPatch	Motivation:A number of statistical phylogenetic methods have been developed to infer conserved functional sites or regions in proteins. Many methods, e.g. Rate4Site, apply the standard phylogenetic models to infer site-specific substitution rates and totally ignore the spatial correlation of substitution rates in protein tertiary structures, which may reduce their power to identify conserved functional patches in protein tertiary structures when the sequences used in the analysis are highly similar. The 3D sliding window method has been proposed to infer conserved functional patches in protein tertiary structures, but the window size, which reflects the strength of the spatial correlation, must be predefined and is not inferred from data. We recently developed GP4Rate to solve these problems under the Bayesian framework. Unfortunately, GP4Rate is computationally slow. Here, we present an intuitive web server, FuncPatch, to perform a fast approximate Bayesian inference of conserved functional patches in protein tertiary structures.Results:Both simulations and four case studies based on empirical data suggest that FuncPatch is a good approximation to GP4Rate. However, FuncPatch is orders of magnitudes faster than GP4Rate. In addition, simulations suggest that FuncPatch is potentially a useful tool complementary to Rate4Site, but the 3D sliding window method is less powerful than FuncPatch and Rate4Site. The functional patches predicted by FuncPatch in the four case studies are supported by experimental evidence, which corroborates the usefulness of FuncPatch.Availability and implementation:The software FuncPatch is freely available at the web site,http://info.mcmaster.ca/yifei/FuncPatchContact:golding@mcmaster.caSupplementary information:Supplementary Dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2288	2298	23	236	1234	0.16673785979	0.135664849195	0.134316028814	0.132686329309	-1.36324308054	2.40882584329	1.79510761527	NULL	2.42484443333	0.142005024418

Participating teams were asked to make inter-species predictions on the basis of available training examples, comprising transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics data.Results:Here, the two best performing teams present their data-driven approaches and computational methods. In addition,post hocanalyses of the datasets and challenge results were performed by the participants and challenge organizers. The challenge outcome indicates that successful prediction of protein phosphorylation status in human based on rat phosphorylation levels is feasible. However, within the limitations of the computational tools used, the inclusion of gene expression data does not improve the prediction quality. The post hoc analysis of time-specific measurements sheds light on the signaling pathways in both species.Availability and implementation:A detailed description of the dataset, challenge design and outcome is available atwww.sbvimprover.com.

The graph is computed on a single preferably high-resolution structure. Information on system’s dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA.The PSN–ENM methodology is made of multiple steps both in the setup and analysis stages, which may discourage inexperienced users. To facilitate its usage, we implemented WebPSN, a freely available web server that allows the user to easily setup the calculation, perform post-processing analyses and both visualize and download numerical and 3D representations of the output.

2395	http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/deml/	2396	NULL	deML	Motivation:Pooling multiple samples increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of DNA sequencing. One approach to multiplexing is to use short DNA indices to uniquely identify each sample. After sequencing, reads must be assignedin silicoto the sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the read index and a reference index set. This approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor.Results:We introduce deML, a maximum likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes Illumina sequences. deML computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample. A quality score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read. Using these quality scores, even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set.Availability and implementation:deML is freely available for use under the GPL (http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/deml/).Contact:gabriel.reno@gmail.comorkelso@eva.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	5	2295	1196	1229	1833	94	0.264583215232	0.178861340048	0.170317783549	0.150584042744	2.32331476133	-0.925608909091	-2.6643008718	NULL	-1.02764261993	-2.70995463817

2398	https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/DANN/	2399	NULL	DANN	Summary:Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD’s SVM methodology.Availability and implementation:All data and source code are available athttps://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/DANN/.Contact:xhx@ics.uci.edu	10.0	7	2297	2233	1202	2011	1005	0.136278591534	0.125152952639	0.119680335175	0.118284318417	0.934909351104	1.75781970449	-3.01797003963	NULL	-1.20317352361	-0.411884293814

Thus, binding ligand prediction provides important insight in understanding the biological function of proteins. Binding ligand prediction is also useful for drug design and examining potential drug side effects.Results:We present a computational method named Patch-Surfer2.0, which predicts binding ligands for a protein pocket. By representing and comparing pockets at the level of small local surface patches that characterize physicochemical properties of the local regions, the method can identify binding pockets of the same ligand even if they do not share globally similar shapes. Properties of local patches are represented by an efficient mathematical representation, 3D Zernike Descriptor. Patch-Surfer2.0 has significant technical improvements over our previous prototype, which includes a new feature that captures approximate patch position with a geodesic distance histogram. Moreover, we constructed a large comprehensive database of ligand binding pockets that will be searched against by a query. The benchmark shows better performance of Patch-Surfer2.0 over existing methods.Availability and implementation:http://kiharalab.org/patchsurfer2.0/Contact:dkihara@purdue.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	2298	2330	915	2343	1372	0.363529384506	0.35881673296	0.292841191541	0.279337062594	-1.26631101475	2.55846803505	1.50588957109	NULL	2.32905217321	0.304439238166
2400	https://github.com/yhoogstrate/flaimapper	2401	NULL	FlaiMapper	Motivation:Recent discoveries show that most types of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) such as miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNAs get further processed into putatively active smaller RNA species. Their roles, genetic profiles and underlying processing mechanisms are only partially understood. To find their quantities and characteristics, a proper annotation is essential. Here, we present FlaiMapper, a method that extracts and annotates the locations of sncRNA-derived RNAs (sncdRNAs). These sncdRNAs are often detected in sequencing data and observed asfragmentsof their precursor sncRNA. Using small RNA-seq read alignments, FlaiMapper is able to annotate fragments primarily by peak detection on the start and end position densities followed by filtering and a reconstruction process.Results:To assess performance of FlaiMapper, we used independent publicly available small RNA-seq data. We were able to detect fragments representing putative sncdRNAs from nearly all types of sncRNA, including 97.8% of the annotated miRNAs in miRBase that have supporting reads. Comparison of FlaiMapper-predicted boundaries of miRNAs with miRBase entries demonstrated that 89% of the start and 54% of the end positions are identical. Additional benchmarking showed that FlaiMapper is superior in performance compared with existing software. Further analysis indicated a variety of characteristics in the fragments, including sequence motifs and relations with RNA interacting factors. These characteristics set a good basis for further research on sncdRNAs.Availability and implementation:The platform independent GPL licensed Python 2.7 code is available at:https://github.com/yhoogstrate/flaimapper.

2401	http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/MACOED/	2402	NULL	MACOED	Motivation:The existing methods for genetic-interaction detection in genome-wide association studies are designed from different paradigms, and their performances vary considerably for different disease models. One important reason for this variability is that their construction is based on a single-correlation model between SNPs and disease. Due to potential model preference and disease complexity, a single-objective method will therefore not work well in general, resulting in low power and a high false-positive rate.Method:In this work, we present a multi-objective heuristic optimization methodology named MACOED for detecting genetic interactions. In MACOED, we combine both logistical regression and Bayesian network methods, which are from opposing schools of statistics. The combination of these two evaluation objectives proved to be complementary, resulting in higher power with a lower false-positive rate than observed for optimizing either objective independently. To solve the space and time complexity for high-dimension problems, a memory-based multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm is designed in MACOED that is able to retain non-dominated solutions found in past iterations.Results:We compared MACOED with other recent algorithms using both simulated and real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in both detection power and computational feasibility for large datasets.Availability and implementation:Codes and datasets are available at:www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/MACOED/.Contact:hbshen@sjtu.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary Dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	5	2300	1383	898	1499	1011	0.171739531384	0.144734474183	0.140890543664	0.133528418011	0.44398959741	0.572558480725	1.61540335031	NULL	0.475704889982	1.36213480854

This situation leads to the prevalence of recessive diseases among the members of these families. Homozygosity mapping is based on this observation, and in consanguineous families, several recessive disease genes have been discovered with the help of this technique. The researchers typically use single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to determine the homozygous regions and then search for the disease gene by sequencing the genes within this candidate disease loci. Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing enables the concurrent identification of homozygous regions and the detection of mutations relevant for diagnosis, using data from a single sequencing experiment. In this respect, we have developed a novel tool that identifies homozygous regions using deep sequence data. Using *.vcf (variant call format) files as an input file, our program identifies the majority of homozygous regions found by microarray single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data.Availability and implementation:HomSI software is freely available atwww.igbam.bilgem.tubitak.gov.tr/softwares/HomSI, with an online manual.Contact:bakirburcu@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	5	2303	2086	609	2457	2278	0.211131630488	0.19494758118	0.152253589525	0.149225759747	-0.825515677854	2.3818369095	-2.15854183882	NULL	-0.206198440651	1.32141868083

With this package, we hope to enable R users to work with BioPAX data and make use of the always increasing amount of biological pathway knowledge within data analysis methods.Results:rBiopaxParser is a software package that provides a comprehensive set of functions for parsing, viewing and modifying BioPAX pathway data within R. These functions enable the user to access and modify specific parts of the BioPAX model. Furthermore, it allows to generate and layout regulatory graphs of controlling interactions and to visualize BioPAX pathways.Availability:rBiopaxParser is an open-source R package and has been submitted to Bioconductor.Contact:frank.kramer@med.uni-goettingen.deSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2309	1678	1723	444	929	0.416195447507	0.411377879254	0.301494386256	0.299713840298	2.2595628546	-0.110471546529	1.55411416878	NULL	-1.22357546575	2.40153928664
2411	http://pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu/adapt-nmr-enhancer	2412	[649]	ADAPT-NMR Enhancer	Summary:ADAPT-nuclear magnetic resonance (ADAPT-NMR) offers an automated approach to the concurrent acquisition and processing of protein NMR data with the goal of complete backbone and side chain assignments. What the approach lacks is a useful graphical interface for reviewing results and for searching for missing peaks that may have prevented assignments or led to incorrect assignments. Because most of the data ADAPT-NMR collects are 2D tilted planes used to find peaks in 3D spectra, it would be helpful to have a tool that reconstructs the 3D spectra. The software package reported here, ADAPT-NMR Enhancer, supports the visualization of both 2D tilted planes and reconstructed 3D peaks on each tilted plane. ADAPT-NMR Enhancer can be used interactively with ADAPT-NMR to automatically assign selected peaks, or it can be used to produce PINE-SPARKY-like graphical dialogs that support atom-by-atom and peak-by-peak assignment strategies. Results can be exported in various formats, including XEASY proton file (.prot), PINE pre-assignment file (.str), PINE probabilistic output file, SPARKY peak list file (.list) and TALOS+ input file (.tab). As an example, we show how ADAPT-NMR Enhancer was used to extend the automated data collection and assignment results for the proteinAedes aegyptisterol carrier protein 2.Availability:The program, in the form of binary code along with tutorials and reference manuals, is available athttp://pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu/adapt-nmr-enhancer.Contact:whlee@nmrfam.wisc.eduormarkley@nmrfam.wisc.edu	1.0	4	2310	1085	1888	666	1233	0.503251548744	0.442580339208	0.351275624497	0.27233719507	0.566700386917	1.72838382098	3.55471869983	NULL	3.17049275695	-0.431879114798

Most of these tools are designed specifically for messenger RNA microarrays. However, today, more and more different microarray platforms are available. Changes in DNA methylation, microRNA expression or even protein phosphorylation states can be detected with specialized arrays. For these microarray technologies, the number of available tools is small compared with mRNA analysis tools. Especially, a joint analysis of different microarray platforms that have been used on the same set of biological samples is hardly supported by most microarray analysis tools. Here, we present InCroMAP, a tool for the analysis and visualization of high-level microarray data from individual or multiple different platforms. Currently, InCroMAP supports mRNA, microRNA, DNA methylation and protein modification datasets. Several methods are offered that allow for an integrated analysis of data from those platforms.

Unfortunately, methods to perform multipoint linkage analysis scale poorly with either the number of markers or with the size of the pedigree. Large pedigrees with many markers can only be evaluated with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that are slow to converge and, as no attempts have been made to exploit parallelism, massively underuse available processing power. Here, we describeSWIFTLINK, a novel application that performs MCMC linkage analysis by spreading the computational burden between multiple processor cores and a graphics processing unit (GPU) simultaneously.SWIFTLINKwas designed around the concept of explicitly matching the characteristics of an algorithm with the underlying computer architecture to maximize performance.Results:We implement our approach using existing Gibbs samplers redesigned for parallel hardware. We appliedSWIFTLINKto a real-world dataset, performing parametric multipoint linkage analysis on a highly consanguineous pedigree with EAST syndrome, containing 28 members, where a subset of individuals were genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Obtaining a multiple alignment from a set of sequences is quite a challenging problem itself, and the quality of the alignment can affect the quality of a prediction. By implementing RNA secondary structure prediction in a statistical alignment framework, and predicting structures from multiple alignment samples instead of a single fixed alignment, it may be possible to improve predictions.Results:We have extended the program StatAlign to make use of RNA-specific features, which include RNA secondary structure prediction from multiple alignments using either a thermodynamic approach (RNAalifold) or a Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) approach (PPfold). We also provide the user with scores relating to the quality of a secondary structure prediction, such as information entropy values for the combined space of secondary structures and sampled alignments, and a reliability score that predicts the expected number of correctly predicted base pairs.

2427	http://minia.genouest.org/dsk	2428	NULL	DSK	Summary:Counting all thek-mers (substrings of lengthk) in DNA/RNA sequencing reads is the preliminary step of many bioinformatics applications. However, state of the artk-mer counting methods require that a large data structure resides in memory. Such structure typically grows with the number of distinctk-mers to count. We present a new streaming algorithm fork-mer counting, called DSK (disk streaming of k-mers), which only requires a fixed user-defined amount of memory and disk space. This approach realizes a memory, time and disk trade-off. The multi-set of allk-mers present in the reads is partitioned, and partitions are saved to disk. Then, each partition is separately loaded in memory in a temporary hash table. Thek-mer counts are returned by traversing each hash table. Low-abundancek-mers are optionally filtered. DSK is the first approach that is able to count all the 27-mers of a human genome dataset using only 4.0 GB of memory and moderate disk space (160 GB), in 17.9 h. DSK can replace a populark-mer counting software (Jellyfish) on small-memory servers.Availability:http://minia.genouest.org/dskContact:rayan.chikhi@ens-cachan.org	9.0	5	2326	1930	2142	2137	1538	0.381688470479	0.32685726114	0.2768296919	0.202638890952	3.3006564529	-0.329199840415	-2.30853922364	NULL	0.100597393193	-3.18323376796

It is especially useful for newly sequenced genomes that have not been well annotated. We applied gKaKs to estimate the genome-wide substitution rates in five pairs of closely related species. The average Ka and Ks computed by gKaKs were consistent with previous studies. We also compared the Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks of mouse and rat orthologous protein-coding genes estimated by gKaKs and based on the alignments generated by PAL2NAL. Results from two methods are compatible.Availability and implementation:gKaKs is implemented in Perl and is freely available onhttp://longlab.uchicago.edu/?q=gKaKs.

Many studies have showed that microRNAs have close relationships with various human cancers, and they potentially could be used as cancer indicators in diagnosis or as a suppressor for treatment purposes. There are several databases that contain microRNA–cancer associations predicted by computational methods but few from empirical results. Despite the fact that abundant experiments investigating microRNA expressions in cancer cells have been carried out, the results have remain scattered in the literature. We propose to extract microRNA–cancer associations by text mining and store them in a database called miRCancer.Results:The text mining is based on 75 rules we have constructed, which represent the common sentence structures typically used to state microRNA expressions in cancers. The microRNA–cancer association database, miRCancer, is updated regularly by running the text mining algorithm against PubMed. All miRNA–cancer associations are confirmed manually after automatic extraction. miRCancer currently documents 878 relationships between 236 microRNAs and 79 human cancers through the processing of >26 000 published articles.Availability:miRCancer is freely available on the web athttp://mircancer.ecu.edu/Contact:dingq@ecu.edu	17.0	5	2329	2144	1704	1071	1158	0.248778566948	0.229928098645	0.222413005871	0.221275072034	-2.42718721234	0.532844150749	-1.54325852059	NULL	-2.38136748474	-0.869043936363
2431	http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/APoc	2432	NULL	APoc	Motivation:Most proteins interact with small-molecule ligands such as metabolites or drug compounds. Over the past several decades, many of these interactions have been captured in high-resolution atomic structures. From a geometric point of view, most interaction sites for grasping these small-molecule ligands, as revealed in these structures, form concave shapes, or ‘pockets’, on the protein’s surface. An efficient method for comparing these pockets could greatly assist the classification of ligand-binding sites, prediction of protein molecular function and design of novel drug compounds.Results:We introduce a computational method, APoc (Alignment ofPockets), for the large-scale, sequence order-independent, structural comparison of protein pockets. A scoring function, the Pocket Similarity Score (PS-score), is derived to measure the level of similarity between pockets. Statistical models are used to estimate the significance of the PS-score based on millions of comparisons of randomly related pockets. APoc is a general robust method that may be applied to pockets identified by various approaches, such as ligand-binding sites as observed in experimental complex structures, or predicted pockets identified by a pocket-detection method. Finally, we curate large benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of APoc and present interesting examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the method. We also demonstrate that APoc has better performance than the geometric hashing-based method SiteEngine.Availability and implementation:The APoc software package including the source code is freely available athttp://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/APoc.Contact:skolnick@gatech.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	7.0	4	2330	2298	2343	522	915	0.363529384506	0.262025281256	0.224152510929	0.201317682428	-1.23493933024	2.42836617743	1.51548982273	NULL	2.27422214258	0.184130900336
2432	https://github.com/uclinfectionimmunity/Decombinator	2433	NULL	Decombinator	Summary:High-throughput sequencing provides an opportunity to analyse the repertoire of antigen-specific receptors with an unprecedented breadth and depth. However, the quantity of raw data produced by this technology requires efficient ways to categorize and store the output for subsequent analysis. To this end, we have defined a simple five-item identifier that uniquely and unambiguously defines each TcR sequence. We then describe a novel application of finite-state automaton to map Illumina short-read sequence data for individual TcRs to their respective identifier. An extension of the standard algorithm is also described, which allows for the presence of single-base pair mismatches arising from sequencing error. The software package, named Decombinator, is tested first on a set of artificialin silicosequences and then on a set of published human TcR-β sequences. Decombinator assigned sequences at a rate more than two orders of magnitude faster than that achieved by classical pairwise alignment algorithms, and with a high degree of accuracy (>88%), even after introducing up to 1% error rates in thein silicosequences. Analysis of the published sequence dataset highlighted the strong V and J usage bias observed in the human peripheral blood repertoire, which seems to be unconnected to antigen exposure. The analysis also highlighted the enormous size of the available repertoire and the challenge of obtaining a comprehensive description for it. The Decombinator package will be a valuable tool for further in-depth analysis of the T-cell repertoire.Availability and implementation:The Decombinator package is implemented in Python (v2.6) and is freely available athttps://github.com/uclinfectionimmunity/Decombinatoralong with full documentation and examples of typical usage.Contact:b.chain@ucl.ac.uk	6.0	4	2331	2106	1760	240	2052	0.205061921564	0.178662687099	0.162550375398	0.149571102837	2.36278613624	0.955149334956	-2.39359103414	NULL	-0.699503882728	-2.19911830296

Although high-coverage sequencing can uncover most variants present in the sequenced sample, low-coverage sequencing is appealing for its cost effectiveness. Here, we present AbCD (arbitrary coverage design) to aid the design of sequencing-based studies. AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5–30×) and sample size (20–10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans). In addition, we also present two software tools: ShotGun and DesignPlanner, which were used to generate the estimates behind AbCD. ShotGun is a flexible short-read simulator for arbitrary user-specified read length and average depth, allowing cycle-specific sequencing error rates and realistic read depth distributions. DesignPlanner is a full pipeline that uses ShotGun to generate sequence data and performs initial SNP discovery, uses our previously presented linkage disequilibrium-aware method to call genotypes, and, finally, provides minor allele frequency-specific effective sample sizes. ShotGun plus DesignPlanner can accommodate effective sample size estimate for any combination of high-depth and low-depth data (for example, whole-genome low-depth plus exonic high-depth) or combination of sequence and genotype data [for example, whole-exome sequencing plus genotyping from existing Genomewide Association Study (GWAS)].Availability and implementation:AbCD, including its downloadable terminal interface and web-based interface, and the associated tools ShotGun and DesignPlanner, including documentation, examples and executables, are available athttp://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/AbCD.html.Contact:yunli@med.unc.edu	1.0	4	2336	1745	2457	2031	488	0.193514759816	0.185491956933	0.180362737395	0.179065023086	0.527007820743	0.0584712200231	-3.03307806917	NULL	-0.736977548224	-1.28278920545

Although the recent availability of high-throughput sequencing data provides necessary resources for in-depth investigation of genomic repeats, its utility is hampered by the lack of specialized bioinformatics tools and appropriate computational resources that would enable large-scale repeat analysis to be run by biologically oriented researchers.Results:Here we present RepeatExplorer, a collection of software tools for characterization of repetitive elements, which is accessible via web interface. A key component of the server is the computational pipeline using a graph-based sequence clustering algorithm to facilitatede novorepeat identification without the need for reference databases of known elements. Because the algorithm uses short sequences randomly sampled from the genome as input, it is ideal for analyzing next-generation sequence reads. Additional tools are provided to aid in classification of identified repeats, investigate phylogenetic relationships of retroelements and perform comparative analysis of repeat composition between multiple species.

To identify genes that may have a disease-causing role, we label all nodes of the network according to the individuals that are carrying a sequence variant and subsequently identify small subnetworks linked to all or most individuals. Using simulated exome-sequencing data, we demonstrate that BioGranat-IG is able to recover the genes responsible for two diseases known to be caused by variants in an underlying complex. We also examine the performance of BioGranat-IG under various conditions likely to be faced by the user, and show that its network-based approach is more powerful than a set-cover-based approach.Availability: We implemented our methods in Java as BioGranat-IG, a bundle within our BioGranat graph analysis and visualization tool (www.biogranat.org).Contact:thomas.schlitt@genetics.kcl.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2339	2052	609	1512	1597	0.274191606126	0.185722022505	0.167922603426	0.164463963066	2.0957513413	1.24883466205	-2.4909791072	NULL	-0.885930377909	-1.04523615524

We next provide a polynomial time heuristic algorithm, SPINAL, which consists of two main phases. In the first coarse-grained alignment phase, we construct all pairwise initial similarity scores based on pairwise local neighborhood matchings. Using the produced similarity scores, the fine-grained alignment phase produces the final one-to-one mapping by iteratively growing a locally improved solution subset. Both phases make use of the construction ofneighborhood bipartite graphsand thecontributorsas a common primitive. We assess the performance of our algorithm on the PPI networks of yeast, fly, human and worm.

2446	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mosaicfinder	2447	NULL	MosaicFinder	Motivation: Gene fusion is an important evolutionary process. It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. Fused genes have been identified as non-transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes. To be computationally tractable, this approach usually imposes ana prioridistinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for, and a dataset that may have provided genetic material for fusion. This reduces the ‘genetic space’ in which fusion can be discovered, as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated. Moreover, this approach may have a high–false-positive rate, and it does not identify gene families descending from a common fusion event.Results: We represent similarities between sequences as a network. This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python programFusedTriplets. Furthermore, we propose a new characterization of families of fused genes, as clique minimal separators of the sequence similarity network. This well-studied graph topology provides a robust and fast method of detection, well suited for automatic analyses of big datasets. We implemented this method in the C++ programMosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false-positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. The grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.Availability:FusedTripletsandMosaicFinderare published under the GPL license and are freely available with their source code at this address:http://sourceforge.net/projects/mosaicfinder.Contact:pogorelc@isima.frSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2345	692	2376	1689	672	0.316317376954	0.30770094323	0.250194997696	0.248825096923	-0.966220529436	-2.27407381411	-3.08673157841	NULL	-2.34153991589	-1.58017763967
2447	http://planform.daniel-lobo.com	2448	NULL	Planform	Summary:Understanding the mechanisms governing the regeneration capabilities of many organisms is a fundamental interest in biology and medicine. An ever-increasing number of manipulation and molecular experiments are attempting to discover a comprehensive model for regeneration, with the planarian flatworm being one of the most important model species. Despite much effort, no comprehensive, constructive, mechanistic models exist yet, and it is now clear that computational tools are needed to mine this huge dataset. However, until now, there is no database of regenerative experiments, and the current genotype–phenotype ontologies and databases are based on textual descriptions, which are not understandable by computers. To overcome these difficulties, we present here Planform (Planarian formalization), a manually curated database and software tool for planarian regenerative experiments, based on a mathematical graph formalism. The database contains more than a thousand experiments from the main publications in the planarian literature. The software tool provides the user with a graphical interface to easily interact with and mine the database. The presented system is a valuable resource for the regeneration community and, more importantly, will pave the way for the application of novel artificial intelligence tools to extract knowledge from this dataset.Availability:The database and software tool are freely available athttp://planform.daniel-lobo.com.Contact:michael.levin@tufts.edu	2.0	4	2346	1156	1328	2061	49	0.2991624554	0.132776942843	0.128295390344	0.112497295085	2.95038988573	-1.81257219173	2.09907469321	NULL	-2.54626410559	1.69925730961

A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST—a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets.

2451	http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/EBSEQ/	2452	NULL	EBSeq	Motivation:Messenger RNA expression is important in normal development and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease. RNA-seq experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer are available for identifying DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based) methods directly toestimatesof isoform counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently, application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.Results:Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian methods, we have developed EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms in an RNA-seq experiment comparing two or more biological conditions. Results demonstrate substantially improved power and performance of EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms. EBSeq also proves to be a robust approach for identifying DE genes.Availability and implementation:An R package containing examples and sample datasets is available athttp://www.biostat.wisc.edu/∼kendzior/EBSEQ/.Contact:kendzior@biostat.wisc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	45.0	7	2350	2010	1305	1257	1089	0.419321240325	0.325267544599	0.243169282759	0.163289728249	-1.5485563576	-0.642847127219	-1.50285583029	NULL	-1.92501854902	-0.861721452107

Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure (MCS) methods. MCS approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect MCSs. To eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible MCSs (FMCSs) containing a user-definable number of atom and/or bond mismatches.Results: ThefmcsRpackage provides an R interface, with the time-consuming steps of the FMCS algorithm implemented in C++. It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization of MCSs. In comparison with an existing MCS tool, fmcsR shows better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and the resulting FMCSs are often substantially larger than their strict MCS counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening (VS) tests, the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of MCS-based similarity search results. With respect to overall and early enrichment performance, FMCS outperforms most of the seven other VS methods considered in these tests.Availability: fmcsR is freely available for all common operating systems from the Bioconductor site (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/fmcsR.html).Contact:thomas.girke@ucr.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2355	1324	1796	658	98	0.290109700368	0.280023886373	0.227910459183	0.200660273386	-1.18897660292	-1.95880471245	-2.22738901101	NULL	-0.694814838811	-0.838596217121

The preservation could be in structure or sequence, or both. Thus, the inverse RNA folding problem could benefit from considering fragment constraints.We have developed a new interactive Java application called RNA fragment-based inverse that allows users to insert an RNA secondary structure in dot-bracket notation. It then performs sequence design that conforms to the shape of the input secondary structure, the specified thermodynamic stability, the specified mutational robustness and the user-selected fragment after shape decomposition. In this shape-based design approach, specific RNA structural motifs with known biological functions are strictly enforced, while others can possess more flexibility in their structure in favor of preserving physical attributes and additional constraints.Availability:RNAfbinv is freely available for download on the web athttp://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/∼RNAexinv/RNAfbinv.

2467	http://code.google.com/p/dist/	2468	NULL	DIST	Motivation:Genotype imputation methods are used to enhance the resolution of genome-wide association studies, and thus increase the detection rate for genetic signals. Although most studies report all univariate summary statistics, many of them limit the access to subject-level genotypes. Because such an access is required by all genotype imputation methods, it is helpful to develop methods that impute summary statistics without going through the interim step of imputing genotypes. Even when subject-level genotypes are available, due to the substantial computational cost of the typical genotype imputation, there is a need for faster imputation methods.Results:Direct Imputation of summary STatistics (DIST) imputes the summary statistics of untyped variants without first imputing their subject-level genotypes. This is achieved by (i) using the conditional expectation formula for multivariate normal variates and (ii) using the correlation structure from a relevant reference population. When compared with genotype imputation methods, DIST (i) requires only a fraction of their computational resources, (ii) has comparable imputation accuracy for independent subjects and (iii) is readily applicable to the imputation of association statistics coming from large pedigree data. Thus, the proposed application is useful for a fast imputation of summary results for (i) studies of unrelated subjects, which (a) do not provide subject-level genotypes or (b) have a large size and (ii) family association studies.Availability and implementation:Pre-compiled executables built under commonly used operating systems are publicly available athttp://code.google.com/p/dist/.Contact:dlee4@vcu.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	2366	2073	2109	2002	2293	0.561576490289	0.41341674901	0.407065777635	0.381662929918	0.0132403750007	1.09046724243	-2.20636947832	NULL	0.897840006435	1.34713578471

Our method is a high-performing and mathematically principled framework for learning similarities between mentions and concept names directly from training data. The technique is based on pairwise learning to rank, which has not previously been applied to the normalization task but has proven successful in large optimization problems for information retrieval.Results:We compare our method with several techniques based on lexical normalization and matching, MetaMap and Lucene.

2471	https://code.google.com/p/pyrohmmvar/	2472	NULL	PyroHMMvar	Motivation:The identification of short insertions and deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Ion Torrent and 454 reads is a challenging problem, essentially because these techniques are prone to sequence erroneously at homopolymers and can, therefore, raise indels in reads. Most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning reads against the reference. The resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles.Results:To address these challenges, we realign reads against the reference using our previously proposed hidden Markov model that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise alignments into a weighted alignment graph. Based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden Markov model, we develop a method called PyroHMMvar, which can simultaneously detect short indels and SNPs, as demonstrated in human resequencing data. Specifically, by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets, we demonstrate that PyroHMMvar produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, such as Samtools and GATK, and is less sensitive to mapping parameter settings than the other methods. We also apply PyroHMMvar to analyze one human whole genome resequencing dataset, and the results confirm that PyroHMMvar predicts SNPs and indels accurately.Availability and implementation:Source code freely available at the following URL:https://code.google.com/p/pyrohmmvar/, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux.Contact:ruijiang@tsinghua.edu.cnorcengf08@mails.thu.edu.cn	1.0	4	2368	1928	1087	2195	1913	0.252958971754	0.179859346234	0.17405183897	0.154772166482	1.56000014683	1.08555855966	-3.26225600654	NULL	-0.340912270461	-1.90990811906

PAVIS, through association with annotation, provides relevant genomic context for each peak, such as peak location relative to genomic features including transcription start site, intron, exon or 5′/3′-untranslated region. PAVIS reports the relative enrichmentP-values of peaks in these functionally distinct categories, and provides a summary plot of the relative proportion of peaks in each category. PAVIS, unlike many other resources, provides a peak-oriented annotation and visualization system, allowing dynamic visualization of tens to hundreds of loci from one or more ChIP-seq experiments, simultaneously.

2478	http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hmcan/	2479	NULL	HMCan	Motivation:Cancer cells are often characterized by epigenetic changes, which include aberrant histone modifications. In particular, local or regional epigenetic silencing is a common mechanism in cancer for silencing expression of tumor suppressor genes. Though several tools have been created to enable detection of histone marks in ChIP-seq data from normal samples, it is unclear whether these tools can be efficiently applied to ChIP-seq data generated from cancer samples. Indeed, cancer genomes are often characterized by frequent copy number alterations: gains and losses of large regions of chromosomal material. Copy number alterations may create a substantial statistical bias in the evaluation of histone mark signal enrichment and result in underdetection of the signal in the regions of loss and overdetection of the signal in the regions of gain.Results:We present HMCan (Histone modifications in cancer), a tool specially designed to analyze histone modification ChIP-seq data produced from cancer genomes. HMCan corrects for the GC-content and copy number bias and then applies Hidden Markov Models to detect the signal from the corrected data. On simulated data, HMCan outperformed several commonly used tools developed to analyze histone modification data produced from genomes without copy number alterations. HMCan also showed superior results on a ChIP-seq dataset generated for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in a bladder cancer cell line. HMCan predictions matched well with experimental data (qPCR validated regions) and included, for example, the previously detected H3K27me3 mark in the promoter of the DLEC1 gene, missed by other tools we tested.Availability:Source code and binaries can be downloaded athttp://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hmcan/, implemented in C++.Contact:haitham.ashoor@kaust.edu.saSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2375	1828	2397	2426	2317	0.322420612272	0.26988628363	0.228767967063	0.204432380216	-2.32404642438	1.45758174409	-1.39480646177	NULL	-2.16635830092	-0.891513229684

The first release contains 2422 unique TF sequences, 10 112 DNA binding sites and 3662 DNA motifs. A survey of the included data sources, organisms and TF families was performed together with proprietary database TRANSFAC, finding that footprintDB has a similar coverage of multicellular organisms, while also containing bacterial regulatory data. A search engine has been designed that drives the prediction of DNA motifs for input TFs, or conversely of TF sequences that might recognize input regulatory sequences, by comparison with database entries. Such predictions can also be extended to a single proteome chosen by the user, and results are ranked in terms of interface similarity. Benchmark experiments with bacterial, plant and human data were performed to measure the predictive power of footprintDB searches, which were able to correctly recover 10, 55 and 90% of the tested sequences, respectively. Correctly predicted TFs had a higher interface similarity than the average, confirming its diagnostic value.Availability and implementation:Web site implemented in PHP, Perl, MySQL and Apache.

2485	http://net.icgeb.org/ptmtreesearch	2486	NULL	PTMTreeSearch	Motivation:Tandem mass spectrometry has become a standard tool for identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Algorithmic searches for PTMs from tandem mass spectrum data (MS/MS) tend to be hampered by noisy data as well as by a combinatorial explosion of search space. This leads to high uncertainty and long search-execution times.Results:To address this issue, we present PTMTreeSearch, a new algorithm that uses a large database of known PTMs to identify PTMs from MS/MS data. For a given peptide sequence, PTMTreeSearch builds a computational tree wherein each path from the root to the leaves is labeled with the amino acids of a peptide sequence. Branches then represent PTMs. Various empirical tree pruning rules have been designed to decrease the search-execution time by eliminating biologically unlikely solutions. PTMTreeSearch first identifies a relatively small set of high confidence PTM types, and in a second stage, performs a more exhaustive search on this restricted set using relaxed search parameter settings. An analysis of experimental data shows that using the same criteria for false discovery, PTMTreeSearch annotates more peptides than the current state-of-the-art methods and PTM identification algorithms, and achieves this at roughly the same execution time. PTMTreeSearch is implemented as a plugable scoring function in the X!Tandem search engine.Availability:The source code of PTMTreeSearch and a demo server application can be found athttp://net.icgeb.org/ptmtreesearch.Contacts:pongor@icgeb.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary materialsare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2381	184	1374	1875	624	0.221215944064	0.177398933732	0.173357149834	0.156429235203	-2.76516526936	-0.601562107266	1.54593239525	NULL	1.20961653606	1.89528253847

The IBD information can then be used for association testing in genetic association studies. One approach for this IBD association testing strategy is to test for excessive IBD between pairs of cases (‘pairwise method’). However, this approach is inefficient because it requires a large number of permutations. Moreover, a limited number of permutations define a lower bound forP-values, which makes fine-mapping of associated regions difficult because, in practice, a much larger genomic region is implicated than the region that is actually associated.Results:In this article, we introduce a new pairwise method ‘Fast-Pairwise’. Fast-Pairwise uses importance sampling to improve efficiency and enable approximation of extremely smallP-values. Fast-Pairwise method takes only days to complete a genome-wide scan. In the application to the WTCCC type 1 diabetes data, Fast-Pairwise successfully fine-maps a known human leukocyte antigen gene that is known to cause the disease.Availability:Fast-Pairwise is publicly available at:http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/graphibd.Contact:eeskin@cs.ucla.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	1.0	4	2382	2228	1809	1916	121	0.366111657804	0.280660123286	0.193856652928	0.169049915813	2.80083903338	-2.53264779355	0.0520433411352	NULL	1.11439576853	2.46685384535

In addition, the package provides a command-line interface for users with scripting and programming needs to incorporate or extend AISAIC to their customized analysis pipelines. This open-source multiplatform software offers several attractive features: (i) it implements a user friendly complete pipeline from processing raw data to reporting analytic results; (ii) it detects deletion types directly from copy number signals using a Bayes hypothesis test; (iii) it estimates the fraction of normal contamination for each sample; (iv) it produces unbiased null distribution of random background alterations by iterative aberration-exclusive permutations; and (v) it identifies significant consensus regions and the percentage of homozygous/hemizygous deletions across multiple samples.

Such techniques could hold the key to understanding complex biological systems such as the protein interactions involved in cancer. However, there is a need for new algorithmic approaches that analyze the large amounts of multi-tag bioimage data from cancerous and normal tissue specimens to begin to infer protein networks and unravel the cellular heterogeneity at a molecular level.Results: The proposed approach analyzes cell phenotypes in normal and cancerous colon tissue imaged using the robotically controlled Toponome Imaging System microscope. It involves segmenting the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-labelled image into cells and determining the cell phenotypes according to their protein–protein dependence profile. These were analyzed using two new measures, Difference in Sums of Weighted cO-dependence/Anti-co-dependence profiles (DiSWOP and DiSWAP) for overall co-expression and anti-co-expression, respectively. These novel quantities were extracted using 11 Toponome Imaging System image stacks from either cancerous or normal human colorectal specimens.

Moreover, it could affect the pharmacological profile of a drug. Therefore, it is important to identify the metabolically labile sites for glucuronidation.Results:In the present study, we developed fourin silicomodels to predict sites of glucuronidation, for four major sites of metabolism functional groups, i.e. aliphatic hydroxyl, aromatic hydroxyl, carboxylic acid or amino nitrogen, respectively.

Synthesis of a fully functional transcriptional factor/protein from DNA involves series of reactions, leading to a delay in gene regulation. The complexity increases with the dynamic delay induced by other small molecules involved in gene regulation, and noisy cellular environment. The dynamic delay in gene regulation is quite evident in high-temporal live cell lineage-imaging data. Although a number of gene-network-inference methods are proposed, most of them ignore the associated dynamic time delay.Results:Here, we propose DDGni (dynamic delay gene-network inference), a novel gene-network-inference algorithm based on the gapped local alignment of gene-expression profiles. The local alignment can detect short-term gene regulations, that are usually overlooked by traditional correlation and mutual Information based methods. DDGni uses ‘gaps’ to handle the dynamic delay and non-uniform sampling frequency in high-temporal data, like live cell imaging data. Our algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and yeast cell cycle data, andCaenorhabditis eleganslive cell imaging data against other prominent methods.

Physical cell separation techniques, such as cell sorting and laser-capture microdissection, can enrich samples for cell types of interest, but are costly, labor intensive and can limit investigation of important interactions between different cell types.Results:We developed a new computational approach, called microarray microdissection with analysis of differences (MMAD), which performs microdissectionin silico. Notably, MMAD (i) allows for simultaneous estimation of cell fractions and gene expression profiles of contributing cell types, (ii) adjusts for microarray normalization bias, (iii) uses the corrected Akaike information criterion during model optimization to minimize overfitting and (iv) provides mechanisms for comparing gene expression and cell fractions between samples in different classes. Computational microdissection of simulated and experimental tissue mixture datasets showed tight correlations between predicted and measured gene expression of pure tissues as well as tight correlations between reported and estimated cell fraction for each of the individual cell types. In simulation studies, MMAD showed superior ability to detect differentially expressed genes in mixed tissue samples when compared with standard metrics, including both significance analysis of microarrays and cell type-specific significance analysis of microarrays.Conclusions:We have developed a new computational tool called MMAD, which is capable of performing robust tissue microdissectionin silico, and which can improve the detection of differentially expressed genes.

The range of application of homology-based predictions can be significantly extended by using sequence profiles and incorporation of local structural features. However, incorporation of the latter terms varies a lot between existing methods, and together with many examples of distant relations not recognized even by the best methods, suggests that further improvements are still possible.Results:Here we describe recent improvements to the fold and function assignment system (FFAS) method, including adding optimized structural features (experimental or predicted), ‘symmetrical’Z-score calculation and re-ranking the templates with a neural network. The alignment accuracy in the new FFAS-3D is now 11% higher than the original and comparable with the most accurate template-based structure prediction algorithms. At the same time, FFAS-3D has high success rate at the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) family, superfamily and fold levels. Importantly, FFAS-3D results are not highly correlated with other programs suggesting that it may significantly improve meta-predictions. FFAS-3D does not require 3D structures of the templates, as using predicted features instead of structure-derived does not lead to the decrease of accuracy. Because of that, FFAS-3D can be used for databases other than Protein Data Bank (PDB) such as Protein families database or Clusters of orthologous groups thus extending its applications to functional annotations of genomes and protein families.Availability and implementation:FFAS-3D is available athttp://ffas.godziklab.org.Contact:adam@godziklab.orgSupplementary Information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	4	2392	73	1974	379	927	0.202796606437	0.173716420981	0.165256498242	0.159904094031	-2.18374256491	0.760644892583	2.85571022495	NULL	2.3824543435	-1.02435630246

For an accurate detection and quantification of transcripts, it is important to resolve the mapping ambiguity for those RNA-Seq reads that can be mapped to multiple loci: >17% of the reads from mouse RNA-Seq data and 50% of the reads from some plant RNA-Seq data have multiple mapping loci.In this study, we show how to resolve the mapping ambiguity in the presence of novel transcriptomic events such as exon skipping and novel indels towards accurate downstream analysis. We introduce ORMAN (OptimalResolution ofMultimappingAmbiguity of RNA-Seq Reads), which aims to compute the minimum number of potential transcript products for each gene and to assign each multimapping read to one of these transcripts based on the estimated distribution of the region covering the read. ORMAN achieves this objective through a combinatorial optimization formulation, which is solved through well-known approximation algorithms, integer linear programs and heuristics.Results:On a simulated RNA-Seq dataset including a random subset of transcripts from the UCSC database, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods for identifying and quantifying novel transcripts, such as Cufflinks, IsoLasso and CLIIQ, is significantly improved through the use of ORMAN.

There already exist tools for merging these paired-end reads when the target fragments are equally long. However, when fragment lengths vary and, in particular, when either the fragment size is shorter than a single-end read, or longer than twice the size of a single-end read, most state-of-the-art mergers fail to generate reliable results. Therefore, a robust tool is needed to merge paired-end reads that exhibit varying overlap lengths because of varying target fragment lengths.Results:We present the PEAR software for merging raw Illumina paired-end reads from target fragments of varying length. The program evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and does not require the target fragment size as input. It also implements a statistical test for minimizing false-positive results. Tests on simulatedandempirical data show that PEAR consistently generates highly accurate merged paired-end reads.

However, their space-efficient representations make use of encoding techniques that are expensive from a computational point of view. With the deluge of data generated by high-throughput sequencing, new approaches need to be developed to deal with larger genomic sequences.Results:In this work, we have developed a new longest common prefix array-sampled representation, optimized to work with the backward search method inherently used by the FM-Index. Unlike previous implementations that sacrifice running time to have smaller space, ours lead to both a fast and a space-efficient approach.

2510	http://www.unc.edu/~yunmli/betaseq	2511	NULL	BETASEQ	Summary:Despite its great capability to detect rare variant associations, next-generation sequencing is still prohibitively expensive when applied to large samples. In case-control studies, it is thus appealing to sequence only a subset of cases to discover variants and genotype the identified variants in controls and the remaining cases under the reasonable assumption that causal variants are usually enriched among cases. However, this approach leads to inflated type-I error if analyzed naively for rare variant association. Several methods have been proposed in recent literature to control type-I error at the cost of either excluding some sequenced cases or correcting the genotypes of discovered rare variants. All of these approaches thus suffer from certain extent of information loss and thus are underpowered. We propose a novel method (BETASEQ), which corrects inflation of type-I error by supplementing pseudo-variants while keeps the original sequence and genotype data intact. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that, in most practical situations, BETASEQ leads to higher testing powers than existing approaches with guaranteed (controlled or conservative) type-I error.Availability and implementation:BETASEQ and associated R files, including documentation, examples, are available athttp://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/betaseqContact:songyan@unc.eduoryunli@med.unc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2406	506	575	1112	1696	0.361230437964	0.301559491455	0.300151752153	0.257777485283	0.585401525747	1.22301429775	-2.82520115065	NULL	-0.0805604947557	0.515980764266

In this method, the potential of a given reaction knockout for production of a specific metabolite is evaluated by shadow pricing of the constraint in the flux balance analysis, which generates a screening score to obtain candidate knockout sets. To evaluate the performance of FastPros, we screened knockout sets to produce each metabolite in the entireEscherichia colimetabolic network. We found that 75% of these metabolites could be produced under biomass maximization conditions by adding up to 25 reaction knockouts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using FastPros in tandem with another screening method, OptKnock, could further improve target metabolite productivity.Availability and implementation:Source code is freely available athttp://www-shimizu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/shimizu_lab/FastPros/, implemented in MATLAB and COBRA toolbox.Contact:chikara.furusawa@riken.jporshimizu@ist.osaka-u.ac.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2418	1972	1295	163	2276	0.156459392786	0.139400495594	0.133938040259	0.122780806788	2.5912043782	1.35725978203	1.79454843394	NULL	-0.475416949479	2.88608399258
2525	http://www.clipz.unibas.ch/TSSer/index.php	2526	NULL	TSSer	Motivation:Accurate identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) is an essential step in the analysis of transcription regulatory networks. In higher eukaryotes, the capped analysis of gene expression technology enabled comprehensive annotation of TSSs in genomes such as those of mice and humans. In bacteria, an equivalent approach, termed differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq), has recently been proposed, but the application of this approach to a large number of genomes is hindered by the paucity of computational analysis methods. With few exceptions, when the method has been used, annotation of TSSs has been largely done manually.Results:In this work, we present a computational method called ‘TSSer’ that enables the automatic inference of TSSs from dRNA-seq data. The method rests on a probabilistic framework for identifying both genomic positions that are preferentially enriched in the dRNA-seq data as well as preferentially captured relative to neighboring genomic regions. Evaluating our approach for TSS calling on several publicly available datasets, we find that TSSer achieves high consistency with the curated lists of annotated TSSs, but identifies many additional TSSs. Therefore, TSSer can accelerate genome-wide identification of TSSs in bacterial genomes and can aid in further characterization of bacterial transcription regulatory networks.Availability:TSSer is freely available under GPL license athttp://www.clipz.unibas.ch/TSSer/index.phpContact:mihaela.zavolan@unibas.chSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2419	1604	2445	234	1387	0.389201409713	0.230908552477	0.166636864172	0.129982541426	1.30289638879	1.40437812188	-1.18795493054	NULL	-0.476965359759	0.0449950281551

This is often achieved by neuropeptides (NPs) that are produced in neurons from a longer protein, named neuropeptide precursor (NPP). The maturation of NPs occurs through a sequence of proteolytic cleavages. The difficulty in identifying NPPs is a consequence of their diversity and the lack of applicable sequence similarity among the short functionally related NPs.Results:Herein, we describe Neuropeptide Precursor Identifier (NeuroPID), a machine learning scheme that predicts metazoan NPPs. NeuroPID was trained on hundreds of identified NPPs from the UniProtKB database. Some 600 features were extracted from the primary sequences and processed using support vector machines (SVM) and ensemble decision tree classifiers. These features combined biophysical, chemical and informational–statistical properties of NPs and NPPs. Other features were guided by the defining characteristics of the dibasic cleavage sites motif. NeuroPID reached 89–94% accuracy and 90–93% precision in cross-validation blind tests against known NPPs (with an emphasis on Chordata and Arthropoda). NeuroPID also identified NPP-like proteins from extensively studied model organisms as well as from poorly annotated proteomes. We then focused on the most significant sets of features that contribute to the success of the classifiers. We propose that NPPs are attractive targets for investigating and modulating behavior, metabolism and homeostasis and that a rich repertoire of NPs remains to be identified.Availability:NeuroPID source code is freely available athttp://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/neuropidContact:michall@cc.huji.ac.ilSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2420	2083	624	346	783	0.123431245293	0.120771342639	0.120715611643	0.0862611963169	-2.85331274563	-0.523836159043	2.7146097906	NULL	2.61395418641	0.585632583236

A novel alignment-free descriptor-based fingerprint approach is presented here and applied to identify allergens and non-allergens. The approach was implemented into a four step algorithm. Initially, the protein sequences are described by amino acid principal properties as hydrophobicity, size, relative abundance, helix and β-strand forming propensities. Then, the generated strings of different length are converted into vectors with equal length by auto- and cross-covariance (ACC). The vectors were transformed into binary fingerprints and compared in terms of Tanimoto coefficient.Results:The approach was applied to a set of 2427 known allergens and 2427 non-allergens and identified correctly 88% of them withMatthews correlation coefficientof 0.759. The descriptor fingerprint approach presented here is universal. It could be applied for any classification problem in computational biology. The set of E-descriptors is able to capture the main structural and physicochemical properties of amino acids building the proteins. The ACC transformation overcomes the main problem in the alignment-based comparative studies arising from the different length of the aligned protein sequences. The conversion of protein ACC values into binary descriptor fingerprints allows similarity search and classification.Availability and implementation:The algorithm described in the present study was implemented in a specially designed Web site, named AllergenFP (FP stands for FingerPrint).

2532	https://github.com/WaveCNV	2533	NULL	WaveCNV	Motivation:Copy number variations (CNVs) are a major source of genomic variability and are especially significant in cancer. Until recently microarray technologies have been used to characterize CNVs in genomes. However, advances in next-generation sequencing technology offer significant opportunities to deduce copy number directly from genome sequencing data. Unfortunately cancer genomes differ from normal genomes in several aspects that make them far less amenable to copy number detection. For example, cancer genomes are often aneuploid and an admixture of diploid/non-tumor cell fractions. Also patient-derived xenograft models can be laden with mouse contamination that strongly affects accurate assignment of copy number. Hence, there is a need to develop analytical tools that can take into account cancer-specific parameters for detecting CNVs directly from genome sequencing data.Results:We have developed WaveCNV, a software package to identify copy number alterations by detecting breakpoints of CNVs using translation-invariant discrete wavelet transforms and assign digitized copy numbers to each event using next-generation sequencing data. We also assign alleles specifying the chromosomal ratio following duplication/loss. We verified copy number calls using both microarray (correlation coefficient 0.97) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (correlation coefficient 0.94) and found them to be highly concordant. We demonstrate its utility in pancreatic primary and xenograft sequencing data.Availability and implementation:Source code and executables are available athttps://github.com/WaveCNV.

Interpreting these data is challenging, largely because of inherent variation in signal-to-noise ratio between datasets. We have developed PeaKDEck, a peak calling program that distinguishes signal from noise by randomly sampling read densities and using kernel density estimation to generate a dataset-specific probability distribution of random background signal. PeaKDEck uses this probability distribution to select an appropriate read density threshold for peak calling in each dataset. We benchmark PeaKDEck using published ENCODE DNaseI-seq data and other peak calling programs, and demonstrate superior performance in low signal-to-noise ratio datasets.Availability and implementation:PeaKDEck is written in standard Perl and runs on any platform with Perl installed.

2546	http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/home/software/gralign/	2547	NULL	GR-Align	Motivation:Protein structure alignment is key for transferring information from well-studied proteins to less studied ones. Structural alignment identifies the most precise mapping of equivalent residues, as structures are more conserved during evolution than sequences. Among the methods for aligning protein structures, maximum Contact Map Overlap (CMO) has received sustained attention during the past decade. Yet, known algorithms exhibit modest performance and are not applicable for large-scale comparison.Results:Graphlets are small induced subgraphs that are used to design sensitive topological similarity measures between nodes and networks. By generalizing graphlets to ordered graphs, we introduce GR-Align, a CMO heuristic that is suited for database searches. On the Proteus_300 set (44 850 protein domain pairs), GR-Align is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art CMO solvers Apurva, MSVNS and AlEigen7, and its similarity score is in better agreement with the structural classification of proteins. On a large-scale experiment on the Gold-standard benchmark dataset (3 207 270 protein domain pairs), GR-Align is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art protein structure comparison tools TM-Align, DaliLite, MATT and Yakusa, while achieving similar classification performances. Finally, we illustrate the difference between GR-Align’s flexible alignments and the traditional ones by querying a flexible protein in the Astral-40 database (11 154 protein domains). In this experiment, GR-Align’s top scoring alignments are not only in better agreement with structural classification of proteins, but also that they allow transferring more information across proteins.Availability and implementation:GR-Align is coded in C++. software and supplementary material are available at:http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/home/software/gralign/.Contact:n.malod-dognin@imperial.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	2440	836	1689	2008	805	0.27761665946	0.258635976311	0.249494719476	0.239089286843	-1.08280143097	0.425039742831	2.14851453189	NULL	2.1751337186	0.105291696784

These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient. Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed, which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by genotype algorithms.Results:GivenMsequences withNbi-allelic variable sites, anO(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional Burrows–Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set inO(NM) time rather thanO(NM2) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically independent ofMgiven sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and phasing.Availability:http://github.com/richarddurbin/pbwtContact:richard.durbin@sanger.ac.uk	4.0	5	2441	2405	2109	2335	1405	0.238986025241	0.225654660349	0.222341652624	0.182345665878	1.64477925504	-1.15751759324	-1.52765859899	NULL	0.0370817948056	-1.80029296907

From a biomedical research perspective, it is also important to identify allergens in sequenced genomes. Many allergen prediction tools have been developed during the past years. Although these tools have achieved certain levels of specificity, when applied to large-scale allergen discovery (e.g. at a whole-genome scale), they still yield many false positives and thus low precision (even at low recall) due to the extreme skewness of the data (allergens are rare). Moreover, the most accurate tools are relatively slow because they use protein sequence alignment to build feature vectors for allergen classifiers. Additionally, only web server implementations of the current allergen prediction tools are publicly available and are without the capability of large batch submission. These weaknesses make large-scale allergen discovery ineffective and inefficient in the public domain.Results:We developedAllerdictor, a fast and accurate sequence-based allergen prediction tool that models protein sequences as text documents and uses support vector machine in text classification for allergen prediction. Test results on multiple highly skewed datasets demonstrated that Allerdictor predicted allergens with high precision over high recall at fast speed. For example, Allerdictor only took ∼6 min on a single core PC to scan a whole Swiss-Prot database of ∼540 000 sequences and identified <1% of them as allergens.Availability and implementation:Allerdictor is implemented in Python and available as standalone and web server versions athttp://allerdictor.vbi.vt.edu.Contact:lawrence@vbi.vt.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2449	1506	2425	1499	434	0.356494474231	0.29237584898	0.0917283254028	0.0907593139193	-3.97810557942	0.0351455920021	1.02582291719	NULL	1.32614826973	-2.00318049156

The accuracy of such prediction algorithms depends on the quality of the multiple-sequence alignment, which is used to infer how an amino acid substitution is tolerated at a given position. Because of the scarcity of orthologous protein sequences in the past, the existing prediction algorithms all include sequences of protein paralogs in the alignment, which can dilute the conservation signal and affect prediction accuracy. However, we believe that, with the sequencing of a large number of mammalian genomes, it is now feasible to include only protein orthologs in the alignment and improve the prediction performance.Results:We have developed a novel prediction algorithm, named SNPdryad, which only includes protein orthologs in building a multiple sequence alignment. Among many other innovations, SNPdryad uses different conservation scoring schemes and uses Random Forest as a classifier. We have tested SNPdryad on several datasets. We found that SNPdryad consistently outperformed other methods in several performance metrics, which is attributed to the exclusion of paralogous sequence. We have run SNPdryad on the complete human proteome, generating prediction scores for all the possible amino acid substitutions.Availability and implementation:The algorithm and the prediction results can be accessed from the Web site:http://snps.ccbr.utoronto.ca:8080/SNPdryad/.Contact:Zhaolei.Zhang@utoronto.caSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	4.0	4	2450	2325	168	146	1102	0.180175865285	0.179596845572	0.160197774715	0.152121640371	-0.825586622745	0.12316537227	2.7851574421	NULL	1.45599548362	-1.40082469671

While methods for their detection are well researched in prokaryotes, the complexity of eukaryotic genomes makes direct utilization of these methods unreliable, and so labour-intensive phylogenetic searches are used instead.Results:We present a surrogate method that investigates nucleotide base composition of the DNA sequence in a eukaryotic genome and identifies putative GIs. We calculate a genomic signature as a vector of tetranucleotide (4-mer) frequencies using a sliding window approach. Extending the neighbourhood of the sliding window, we establish a local kernel density estimate of the4-merfrequency. We score the number of4-merfrequencies in the sliding window that deviate from the credibility interval of their local genomic density using a newly developed discrete interval accumulative score (DIAS). To further improve the effectiveness of DIAS, we select informative4-mersin a range of organisms using the tetranucleotide quality score developed herein. We show that the SigHunt method is computationally efficient and able to detect GIs in eukaryotic genomes that represent non-ameliorated integration. Thus, it is suited to scanning for change in organisms with different DNA composition.Availability and implementation:Source code and scripts freely available for download athttp://www.iba.muni.cz/index-en.php?pg=research–data-analysis-tools–sighuntare implemented in C and R and are platform-independent.Contact:376090@mail.muni.czormartinkova@ivb.cz	0.0	4	2452	1020	1025	885	2338	0.182584049584	0.151328231861	0.124902712004	0.115826038514	3.04230874057	-0.0710930389238	-0.386491193721	NULL	0.878634322135	-1.54988759597

Available algorithms use one or more sources of evidence, such as read depth, paired-end reads or split reads to predict structural variants. However, the problem remains challenging due to the significant computational burden and high false-positive or false-negative rates.Results:In this article, we present Socrates (SOft Clip re-alignment To idEntify Structural variants), a highly efficient and effective method for detecting genomic rearrangements in tumours that uses only split-read data. Socrates has single-nucleotide resolution, identifies micro-homologies and untemplated sequence at break points, has high sensitivity and high specificity and takes advantage of parallelism for efficient use of resources.

Estimates of tumor purity and ploidy are necessary to correctly infer copy number, and ploidy may itself be a prognostic factor in cancer progression. As deep sequencing of the exome or genome has become routine for characterization of tumor samples, in this work, we aim to develop a simple and robust algorithm to infer purity, ploidy and absolute copy numbers in whole numbers for tumor cells from sequencing data.Results:A simulation study shows that estimates have reasonable accuracy, and that the algorithm is robust against the presence of segmentation errors and subclonal populations. We validated our algorithm against a panel of cell lines with experimentally determined ploidy. We also compared our algorithm with the well-established single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based method called ABSOLUTE on three sets of tumors of different types. Our method had good performance on these four benchmark datasets for both purity and ploidy estimates, and may offer a simple solution to copy number alteration quantification for cancer sequencing projects.Availability and implementation:TheRpackage absCNseq is available fromhttp://biostats.mcc.ucsd.edu/files/absCNseq_1.0.tar.gz.Contact:kmesser@ucsd.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	3.0	6	2454	1812	1315	2188	2426	0.315927384557	0.313408854535	0.286017266793	0.255048081577	-0.457812169424	1.11591524446	-4.05412899281	NULL	-2.53777570603	-1.08012106315

Genotypes and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms are then determined from the read composition at each site, which become the basis for many downstream analyses. However, for low sequencing depths, e.g., there is considerable statistical uncertainty in the assignment of genotypes because of random sampling of homologous base pairs in heterozygotes and sequencing or alignment errors. Recently, several probabilistic methods have been proposed to account for this uncertainty and make accurate inferences from low quality and/or coverage sequencing data.We presentngsTools, a collection of programs to perform population genetics analyses from next-generation sequencing data.

This transcriptional landscape reconstruction relies on a state-space model to describe transcription level variations in terms of abrupt shifts and more progressive drifts. A new emission model is introduced to capture not only the read count variance inside a transcript but also its short-range autocorrelation and the fraction of positions with zero counts.

The two pioneering papers on BLAST have received over 96 000 citations. Given the huge population of BLAST users and the increasing size of sequence databases, an urgent topic of study is how to improve the speed. Recently, graphics processing units (GPUs) have been widely used as low-cost, high-performance computing platforms. The existing GPU-BLAST is a promising software tool that uses a GPU to accelerate protein sequence alignment. Unfortunately, there is still no GPU-accelerated software tool for BLAST-based nucleotide sequence alignment.Results:We developed G-BLASTN, a GPU-accelerated nucleotide alignment tool based on the widely used NCBI-BLAST. G-BLASTN can produce exactly the same results as NCBI-BLAST, and it has very similar user commands. Compared with the sequential NCBI-BLAST, G-BLASTN can achieve an overall speedup of 14.80X under ‘megablast’ mode. More impressively, it achieves an overall speedup of 7.15X over the multithreaded NCBI-BLAST running on 4 CPU cores. When running under ‘blastn’ mode, the overall speedups are 4.32X (against 1-core) and 1.56X (against 4-core). G-BLASTN also supports a pipeline mode that further improves the overall performance by up to 44% when handling a batch of queries as a whole. Currently G-BLASTN is best optimized for databases with long sequences.

Generally, either the server or the client is responsible for the majority of data processing, resulting in either servers having to receive and handle data relevant only to one user, or clients redundantly processing widely viewed data. ChromoZoom pre-renders and caches general-use tracks into tiled images on the server and serves them in an interactive web interface with inertial scrolling and precise, fluent zooming via the mouse wheel or trackpad. Custom tracks in several formats can be rendered by client-side code alongside the pre-rendered tracks, minimizing server load because of user-specific rendering and eliminating the need to transmit private data. ChromoZoom thereby enables rapid and simultaneous exploration of curated, experimental and personal genomic datasets.Availability:Human and yeast genome researchers may browse recent assemblies within ChromoZoom athttp://chromozoom.org/.

2580	http://chmille4.github.com/Scribl/	2581	NULL	Scribl	Motivation:High-throughput biological research requires simultaneous visualization as well as analysis of genomic data, e.g. read alignments, variant calls and genomic annotations. Traditionally, such integrative analysis required desktop applications operating on locally stored data. Many current terabyte-size datasets generated by large public consortia projects, however, are already only feasibly stored at specialist genome analysis centers. As even small laboratories can afford very large datasets, local storage and analysis are becoming increasingly limiting, and it is likely that most such datasets will soon be stored remotely, e.g. in the cloud. These developments will require web-based tools that enable users to access, analyze and view vast remotely stored data with a level of sophistication and interactivity that approximates desktop applications. As rapidly dropping cost enables researchers to collect data intended to answer questions in very specialized contexts, developers must also provide software libraries that empower users to implement customized data analyses and data views for their particular application. Such specialized, yet lightweight, applications would empower scientists to better answer specific biological questions than possible with general-purpose genome browsers currently available.Results:Using recent advances in core web technologies (HTML5), we developed Scribl, a flexible genomic visualization library specifically targeting coordinate-based data such as genomic features, DNA sequence and genetic variants. Scribl simplifies the development of sophisticated web-based graphical tools that approach the dynamism and interactivity of desktop applications.Availability and implementation:Software is freely available online athttp://chmille4.github.com/Scribl/and is implemented in JavaScript with all modern browsers supported.Contact:gabor.marth@bc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	2.0	4	2472	1790	960	794	2037	0.201566624916	0.190958335075	0.190632015086	0.17359192133	1.10259812774	-1.74755570498	-0.156876482829	NULL	-1.23184447128	-0.429782249519

However, numerous reactions have been described in various pathways that do not have an official EC number, and the reactions are not expected to have an EC number assigned because of a lack of articles published on enzyme assays. To predict the EC number of a non-classified enzymatic reaction, we focus on the structural similarity of its substrate and product to the substrate and product of reactions that have been classified.Results:We propose a new method to assign EC numbers using a maximum common substructure algorithm, mutual information and a support vector machine, termed the Enzyme COmmission numbers Handler (ECOH). A jack-knife test shows that the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the method in predicting the first three digits of the official EC number (i.e. the EC sub-subclass) are 86.1%, 87.4% and 99.8%, respectively. We furthermore demonstrate that, by examining the ranking in the candidate lists of EC sub-subclasses generated by the algorithm, the method can successfully predict the classification of 85 enzymatic reactions that fall into multiple EC sub-subclasses. The better performance of the ECOH as compared with existing methods and its flexibility in predicting EC numbers make it useful for predicting enzyme function.Availability:ECOH is freely available via the Internet athttp://www.bioinfo.sk.ritsumei.ac.jp/apps/ecoh/.

The challenge for computer-aided methods in agrochemical arena is a lack of sufficient information for both pesticides and their targets. Therefore, it is important to establish such knowledge repertoire that contains comprehensive pesticides’ profiles, which include physicochemical properties, environmental fates, toxicities and mode of actions. Here, we present an integrated platform called Pesticide-Target interaction database (PTID), which comprises a total of 1347 pesticides with rich annotation of ecotoxicological and toxicological data as well as 13 738 interactions of pesticide-target and 4245 protein terms via text mining. Additionally, through the integration of ChemMapper, an in-house computational approach to polypharmacology, PTID can be used as a computational platform to identify pesticides targets and design novel agrochemical products.Availability:http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/ptid/.Contact:hlli@ecust.edu.cn;xhqian@ecust.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary dataare available atBioinformaticsonline.	0.0	4	2474	1268	1955	839	2059	0.271246939491	0.126252428524	0.115082463471	0.114614920407	-0.614898308304	-0.0500496443494	1.02384519761	NULL	0.734833280705	2.99841951601

The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi™) was developed to enable integration of multiple sources of evidence on exposure and/or safety, transformed into transparent visual rankings to facilitate decision making. The rankings and associated graphical profiles can be used to prioritize resources in various decision contexts, such as testing chemical toxicity or assessing similarity of predicted compound bioactivity profiles. The amount and types of information available to decision makers are increasing exponentially, while the complex decisions must rely on specialized domain knowledge across multiple criteria of varying importance. Thus, the ToxPi bridges a gap, combining rigorous aggregation of evidence with ease of communication to stakeholders.Results:An interactive ToxPi graphical user interface (GUI) application has been implemented to allow straightforward decision support across a variety of decision-making contexts in environmental health. The GUI allows users to easily import and recombine data, then analyze, visualize, highlight, export and communicate ToxPi results.
