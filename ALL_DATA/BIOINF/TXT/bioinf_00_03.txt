We also propose to aggregate the discriminating powerof these rules for reliable predictions. The discovered rules arefound to contain low-ranked features; these features are found to besometimes necessary for classifiers to achieve perfect accuracy. Theuse of low-ranked but essential features in our method is inconstrast to the prevailing use of an ad-hoc number of onlytop-ranked features. On a wide range of data sets, our methoddisplayed highly competitive accuracy compared to the bestperformance of other kinds of classification models. In addition toaccuracy, our method also provides comprehensible rules to helpelucidate the translation between raw data and usefulknowledge.Supplementary information:http://sdmc.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/GEDatasets/supplementaldata/eccb2003/ECCB2003.html.Contact:jinyan@i2r.a-star.edu.sg*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii93/180341/Discovery-of-significant-rules-for-classifying	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1066	NULL	http://jinyan@i2r.a-star.edu.sg	NULL	NULL

Mathog	NULL	Summary:BLAST programs often run on large SMP machines where multiple threads can work simultaneously and there is enough memory to cache the databases between program runs. A group of programs is described which allows comparable performance to be achieved with a Beowulf configuration in which no node has enough memory to cache a database but the cluster as an aggregate does. To achieve this result, databases are split into equal sized pieces and stored locally on each node. Each query is run on all nodes in parallel and the resultant BLAST output files from all nodes merged to yield the final output.Availability:Source code is available fromftp://saf.bio.caltech.edu/	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100025&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1865/246052/Parallel-BLAST-on-split-databases	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg250	NULL	http://mathog@caltech.edu	NULL	NULL

Nussinov,H. Wolfson	NULL	We present a novel method for multiple alignment of protein structures and detection of structural motifs. To date, only a few methods are available for addressing this task. Most of them are based on a series of pairwise comparisons. In contrast, MASS (MultipleAlignment bySecondaryStructures) considers all the given structures at the same time. Exploiting the secondary structure representation aids in filtering out noisy results and in making the method highly efficient and robust. MASS disregards the sequence order of the secondary structure elements. Thus, it can find non-sequential and even non-topological structural motifs. An important novel feature of MASS is subset alignment detection: It does not require that all the input molecules be aligned. Rather, MASS is capable of detecting structural motifs shared only by a subset of the molecules. Given its high efficiency and capability of detecting subset alignments, MASS is suitable for a broad range of challenging applications: It can handle large-scale protein ensembles (on the order of tens) that may be heterogeneous, noisy, topologically unrelated and contain structures of low resolution.Keywords: Structural Bioinformatics, Subset alignment, Non-sequential alignment, Non-topological motif, Supersecondary structural motifAvailability: MASS program and more information about it are available onhttp://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASSContact:oranit@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i95/227775/MASS-multiple-structural-alignment-by-secondary	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1012	NULL	http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASS,http://oranit@post.tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL

Chen,J. F. Wang,Y. Z. Chen	NULL	Summary: Drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) often involve interaction of a drug with specific proteins. Knowledge about these ADME-associated proteins is important in facilitating the study of the molecular mechanism of disposition and individual response as well as therapeutic action of drugs. It is also useful in the development and testing of pharmacokinetics prediction tools. Several databases describing specific classes of ADME-associated proteins have appeared. A new database, ADME-associated proteins (ADME-AP), is introduced to provide comprehensive information about all classes of ADME-associated proteins described in the literature including physiological function of each protein, pharmacokinetic effect, ADME classification, direction and driving force of disposition, location and tissue distribution, substrates, synonyms, gene name and protein availability in other species. Cross-links to other databases are also provided to facilitate the access of information about the sequence, 3D structure, function, polymorphisms, genetic disorders, nomenclature, ligand binding properties and related literatures of each protein. ADME-AP currently contains entries for 321 proteins and 964 substrates.Availability:http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/admet/admet.aspContact:yzchen@cz3.nus.edu.sg*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800025&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1699/239633/ADME-AP-a-database-of-ADME-associated-proteins	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1699	NULL	http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/admet/admet.asp,http://yzchen@cz3.nus.edu.sg	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

SNPs can be used as markers to create high-density genetic maps, as causal candidates for diseases, or to reconstruct the history of our genome. SNP-based studies rely on the availability of large numbers of validated, high-frequency SNPs whose position on the chromosomes is known with precision. Although large collections of SNPs exist in public databases, researchers need tools to effectively retrieve and manipulate them.Results: We describe the implementation and usage of SNPper, a web-based application to automate the tasks of extracting SNPs from public databases, analyzing them and exporting them in formats suitable for subsequent use.

Shabalina,Alexey S. Kondrashov	NULL	Motivation: As a first approximation, similarity between two longorthologous regions of genomes can be represented by a chain of localsimilarities. Within such a chain, pairs of successive similarities arecollinear (non-conflicting), i.e. segments involved in thenth similarityprecede in both sequences segments involved in the (n+1)th similarity.However, when all similarities between two long sequences are considered,usually there are many conflicts between them. Although some conflicts canbe avoided by masking transposons or low-complexity sequences, selectingonly those similarities that reflect orthology and, thus, belong to theevolutionarily true chain is not trivial.Results: We propose a simple, hierarchical algorithm of finding thetrue chain of local similarities. Starting from similarities with lowP-values, we resolve each pairwise conflict by deleting a similarity with ahigherP-value. This greedy approach constructs a chain of similaritiesfaster than when a chain optimal with respect to some global criterion issought, and makes more sense biologically.Availability: A software tool OWEN based on the proposed approachis described in the accompanying note and is freely available atftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/kondrashov/owenContact:kondrashov@ncbi.nlm.nih.govSupplementary information: Algorithm Chain and examples of chainsof local similarities are available atftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/kondrashov/owen/extra*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800017&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1673/239494/A-hierarchical-approach-to-aligning-collinear	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1673	NULL	http://kondrashov@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov	NULL	NULL

Johnson,Paul Kellam,Christine A. Orengo	NULL	Motivation: The PFDB (Protein Family Database) is a new database designed tointegrate protein family-related data with relevant functional and genomicdata. It currently manages biological data for three projects—the CATHprotein domain database (Orengoet al., 1997; Pearlet al., 2001), the VIDA virusdomains database (Albàet al., 2001) and the Gene3D database (Buchanet al., 2001). The PFDB has been designed to accommodate protein families identifiedby a variety of sequence based or structure based protocols and provides ageneric resource for biological research by enabling mapping betweendifferent protein families and diverse biochemical and genetic data,including complete genomes.Results: A characteristic feature of the PFDB is that it has a number ofmeta-level entities (for exampleaggregation, collectionandinclusion) represented as base tables in thefinal design. The explicit representation of relationships at the meta-levelhas a number of advantages, including flexibility—both in terms of therange of queries that can be formulated and the ability to integrate newbiological entities within the existing design. A potential drawback withthis approach—poor performance caused by the number of joins acrossmeta-level tables—is avoided by implementing the PFDB with materializedviews using the mature relational database technology of Oracle 8i.

As the sequence–template pairs are increasinglyremote in sequence relationship, the prediction of the sequence–templatealignments becomes increasingly problematic with sequence alignment methods.Structural information of the template, used in connection with the sequencerelationship of the sequence–template pair, could significantly improve theaccuracy of the sequence–template alignment. In this paper, we describe asequence–template alignment method that integrates sequence and structuralinformation to enhance the accuracy of sequence–template alignments fordistantly related protein pairs.Results: The structure-dependent sequence alignment (SDSA)procedure was optimized for coverage and accuracy on a training set of 412protein pairs; the structures for each of the training pairs are similar(RMSD<∼4Å) but the sequence relationship is undetectable (averagepair-wise sequence identity = 8%). The optimized SDSA procedure was thenapplied to extend PSI-BLAST local alignments by calculating the globalalignments under the constraint of the residue pairs in the localalignments. This composite alignment procedure was assessed with a testingset of 1421 protein pairs, of which the pair-wise structures are similar(RMSD<∼4Å) but the sequences are marginally related at best ineach pair (average pair-wise sequence identity = 13%). The assessmentshowed that the composite alignment procedure predicted more alignedresidues pairs with an average of 27% increase in correctly alignedresidues over the standard PSI-BLAST alignments for the protein pairs in thetesting set.Availability: All the computational and assessment procedures havebeen implemented in the integrated computational system PrISM.1 (ProteinInformatics System for Modeling).

and global protein  structure predictions"	http://www.columbia.edu/~ay1/,http://ay1@columbia.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	17	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	An-Suei Yang,Lu-yong Wang	NULL	Motivation: A large body of evidence suggests that protein structuralinformation is frequently encoded in local sequences—sequence–structurerelationships derived from local structure/sequence analyses could significantlyenhance the capacities of protein structure prediction methods. In this paper,the prediction capacity of a database (LSBSP2) that organizes local sequence–structure relationships encoded in local structures with two consecutivesecondary structure elements is tested with two computational procedures forprotein structure prediction. The goal is twofold: to test the foldinghypothesis that local structures are determined by local sequences, and toenhance our capacity in predicting protein structures from their amino acidsequences.Results: The LSBSP2 database contains a large set of sequence profiles derivedfrom exhaustive pair-wise structural alignments for local structures with twoconsecutive secondary structure elements. One computational procedure makes useof the PSI-BLAST alignment program to predict local structures for testingsequence fragments by matching the testing sequence fragments onto the sequenceprofiles in the LSBSP2 database. The results show that 54% of the test sequencefragments were predicted with local structures that match closely with theirnative local structures. The other computational procedure is a filter systemthat is capable of removing false positives as possible from a set of PSI-BLASThits. An assessment with a large set of non-redundant protein structures showsthat the PSI-BLAST + filter system improves the prediction specificity by up to two-fold over the prediction specificity of the PSI-BLAST program for distantlyrelated protein pairs. Tests with the two computational procedures abovedemonstrate that local sequence–structure relationships can indeed enhance ourcapacity in protein structure prediction. The results also indicate that localsequences encoded with strong local structure propensities play an importantrole in determining the native state folding topology.Availability: All the computational and assessment procedures have beenimplemented in the integrated computational system PrISM.1 (Protein InformaticsSystem for Modeling).

Gilks,Benjamin Audit,Daniela De Angelis,Sophia Tsoka,Christos A. Ouzounis	NULL	Public sequence databases contain information on thesequence, structure and function of proteins. Genome sequencing projectshave led to a rapid increase in protein sequence information, but reliable,experimentally verified, information on protein function lags a long waybehind.To address this deficit, functional annotation in protein databases is ofteninferred by sequence similarity to homologous, annotated proteins,with the attendant possibility of error.Now, the functional annotation in these homologous proteins may itselfhave been acquired through sequence similarity to yet other proteins,and it is generally not possible to determine how thefunctional annotation of any given protein has been acquired.Thus the possibility of chains of misannotation arises, a process we term‘error percolation’.With some simple assumptions, we develop a dynamical probabilistic model forthese misannotation chains.By exploring the consequences of the model for annotation quality it isevident that this iterative approach leads to a systematic deteriorationof database quality.Contact: WRG:wally.gilks@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk; BA and CAO:audit@ebi.ac.uk;ouzounis@ebi.ac.uk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†Both these authors contributed equally to this work.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1641/239411/Modeling-the-percolation-of-annotation-errors-in-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1641	NULL	http://wally.gilks@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk,http://audit@ebi.ac.uk,http://ouzounis@ebi.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

arrays: a multiplicative  noise model"	http://sasik@corgon.ucsd.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	7	61	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	R. Šášik,E. Calvo,J. Corbeil	NULL	Motivation: High-density oligonucleotide arrays (GeneChip, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) have become a standard research tool in many areas ofbiomedical research. They quantitativelymonitor the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously by measuringfluorescence from gene-specific targets or probes.The relationship between signal intensities and transcript abundance as well as normalization issues have been the focus of much recent attention(Hillet al., 2001; Chudinet al., 2002; Naefet al., 2002a). It is desirable that a researcher has the best possible analytical tools tomake the most of the information that this powerful technology has to offer. At present there are three analytical methods available: the newly releasedAffymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 (AMS) software that accompanies theGeneChip product, the method of Li and Wong (LW; Li and Wong, 2001), and the method of Naefet al.(FN; Naefet al., 2001).The AMS method is tailored for analysis of a single microarray, and can therefore be used with any experimental design. The LW method on the other handdepends on a large number of microarrays in an experiment and cannot be used for an isolated microarray, and the FN method is particular topairedmicroarrays, such as resulting from an experimentin which each ‘treatment’ sample has a corresponding ‘control’ sample.Our focus is on analysis of experiments in which there is a series of samples. In this case only the AMS, LW, and the method described in this paper can be used. The present method is model-based, like the LW method, but assumes multiplicative not additive noise, and employs elimination of statistically significant outliers forimproved results.Unlike LW and AMS, we do not assume probe-specific background (measured by the so-called mismatch probes). Rather, we assume uniform background, whose level is estimated using boththe mismatch and perfect match probe intensities.Results: We present a new method for GeneChip analysis, based on a statistical modelwith multiplicative noise. We demonstrated that this method yields resultssuperior to those obtained by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software and to those obtained by the model-based method of Li and Wong (Li and Wong, 2001). The present methodeliminates the hard-to-interpretnegative expression indices, and the binary‘ presence’calls (present or absent) are replaced by the statistical significance (p-value) of gene expression. We have found that thresholding thep-values at the (0.1)16–level produces about the same number of ‘present’ calls as the AMS software. By testingour method on a pair of replicate GeneChips (hybridized with the same cRNA), we found that 95.6% of data points lie within the 1.25–fold interval. In other words,our method had a 4.4% type I error rate at the 1.25–fold level. The error rate of the LW method was 15%, and that of the AMS method was 29%. There werenopoints outside the 2–fold interval with the present method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of another experiment with multiple replicates shows that this reduction ofvariance isnotaccompanied by a corresponding reduction of signal. On the contrary, the signal-to-noise ratio (as measured by the distribution ofF-statistics)of the present method is on average3.4-times better than that of AMS, and 1.4-times better than that of Li and Wong.Contact:sasik@corgon.ucsd.eduAvailability: A Fortran 90 source code of this method isavailable from the corresponding author upon request.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1633/239396/Statistical-analysis-of-high-density	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1633	NULL	http://sasik@corgon.ucsd.edu	NULL	NULL

application to DNA microarray survival data"	http://stat.tamu.edu/~dnguyen/supplemental.html,http://dnguyen@stat.tamu.edu,http://dmrocke@ucdavis.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	25	92	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Danh V. Nguyen,David M. Rocke	NULL	Motivation: Microarrays are increasingly used in cancer research. When gene transcription data from microarray experiments also contains patient survival information, it is often of interest to predict the survival times based on the gene expression. In this paper we consider the well-known proportional hazard (PH) regression model for survival analysis. Ordinarily, the PH model is used with a few covariates and many observations (subjects). We consider here the case that the number of covariates,p, exceeds the number of samples,N, a setting typical of gene expression data from DNA microarrays.Results: For a given vector of response values which are survival times andpgene expressions (covariates) we examine the problem of how to predict the survival probabilities, whenN ≪ p. The approach taken to cope with the high dimensionality is to reduce the dimension using partial least squares with the response variable as the vector of survival times. After dimension reduction, the extracted PLS gene components are then used as covariates in a PH regression to predict the survival probabilities. We demonstrate the use of the methodology on two cDNA gene expression data sets, both containing survival data. The first data set contains 40 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissue samples and the second data set contains 49 tissue samples from patients with locally advanced breast cancer in a prospective study.Availability: The methodology can be implemented using a combination of standard statistical methods, available, for example, in SAS.

Miskin,Stephen K. Smith,David J. C. MacKay	NULL	Motivation: A number of algorithms and analytical models have been employed toreduce the multidimensional complexity of DNA array data and attempt to extractsome meaningful interpretation of the results.These include clustering,principal components analysis, self-organizing maps, and support vector machineanalysis.Each method assumes an implicit model for the data, many of whichseparate genes into distinct clusters defined by similar expression profiles inthe samples tested.A point of concern is that many genes may be involved in anumber of distinct behaviours, and should therefore be modelled to fit into asmany separate clusters as detected in the multidimensional gene expressionspace.The analysis of gene expression data using a decomposition model that isindependent of the observer involved would be highly beneficial to improvestandard and reproducible classification of clinical and research samples.Results: We present a variational independent component analysis (ICA) methodfor reducing high dimensional DNA array data to a smaller set of latentvariables, each associated with a gene signature. We present the results ofapplying the method to data from an ovarian cancer study, revealing a number oftissue type-specific and tissue type-independent gene signatures present invarying amounts among the samples surveyed.The observer independent results ofsuch molecular analysis of biological samples could help identify patients whowould benefit from different treatment strategies.

microarray experiments"	http://doerge@purdue.edu,http://blackma@stat.purdue.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	109	48	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Michael A. Black,R. W. Doerge	NULL	Motivation: We present statistical methods for determining the number of per gene replicate spots required in microarray experiments.The purpose of these methods is to obtain an estimate of the sampling variability present in microarray data, and to determine the number of replicate spots required to achieve a high probability of detecting a significant fold change in gene expression, while maintaining a low error rate. Our approach is based on data from control microarrays, and involves the use of standard statistical estimation techniques.Results: After analyzing two experimental data sets containing control array data, we were able to determine the statistical power available for the detection of significant differential expression given differing levels of replication. The inclusion of replicate spots on microarrays not only allows more accurate estimation of the variability present in an experiment, but more importantly increases the probability of detecting genes undergoing significant fold changes in expression, while substantially decreasing the probability of observing fold changes due to chance rather than true differential expression.Availability: The methods presented here are based on standard techniques, and are available in most statistical software packages.

Culhane,Guy Perrière,Elizabeth C. Considine,Thomas G. Cotter,Desmond G. Higgins	NULL	Motivation: Most supervised classification methods are limited bythe requirement for more cases than variables. In microarray data the numberof variables (genes) far exceeds the number of cases (arrays), and thusfiltering and pre-selection of genes is required. We describe theapplication of Between Group Analysis (BGA) to the analysis of microarraydata. A feature of BGA is that it can be used when the number of variables(genes) exceeds the number of cases (arrays). BGA is based on carrying outan ordination of groups of samples, using a standard method such asCorrespondence Analysis (COA), rather than an ordination of the individualmicroarray samples. As such, it can be viewed as a method of carrying outCOA with grouped data.Results: We illustrate the power of the method using two cancerdata sets. In both cases, we can quickly and accurately classify testsamples from any number of specifieda priorigroups and identify the genes which characterize these groups. We obtained very high rates of correctclassification, as determined by jack-knife or validation experiments withtraining and test sets. The results are comparable to those from othermethods in terms of accuracy but the power and flexibility of BGA make it anespecially attractive method for the analysis of microarray cancer data.Availability: The methods described are implemented in ADE-4 whichruns under MacOS and Windows, and is freely available athttp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ADE-4/.

Harrington,M.-h. Ho,J. Baid,S. P. Smeekens	NULL	Motivation: We consider the detection of expressed genes and the comparison of them in different experiments with the high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The results are summarized as the detection calls and comparison calls, and they should be robust against data outliers over a wide target concentrationrange. It is also helpful to provide parameters that can be adjusted by the user to balance specificity and sensitivity under various experimental conditions.Results: We present rank-based algorithms for making detection and comparison calls onexpression microarrays. The detection call algorithm utilizes the discrimination scores. The comparison call algorithm utilizes intensity differences. Both algorithms are based on Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. Several parameters in the algorithms can be adjusted by the user to alter levels of specificity and sensitivity. The algorithms were developed and analyzed using spiked-in genes arrayed in a Latin square format. In the call process,p-values are calculated to give a confidence levelfor the pertinent hypotheses. For comparison calls made between two arrays, two primary normalization factors are defined. To overcome the difficulty that constant normalization factors do not fit all probe sets, we perturb these primary normalization factors and make increasing or decreasing calls only if all resultingp-values fall within a defined critical region. Our algorithms also automatically handle scanner saturation.Availability: These algorithms are available commercially as part of the MAS 5.0 software package.Contact:wei-min_liu@affymetrix.com*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†Current address: Mail Code CR145, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 79201	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1593/239312/Analysis-of-high-density-expression-microarrays	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1593	NULL	http://wei-min_liu@affymetrix.com	NULL	NULL

39	Comparing expression profiles of genes with similar promoter regions	http://peter_park@harvard.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	22	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Peter J. Park,Atul J. Butte,Isaac S. Kohane	NULL	Motivation: Gene regulatory elements are often predicted by seeking common sequences in the promoter regions of genes that are clustered together based on their expression profiles.We consider the problem in the opposite direction: we seek to find the genes that have similar promoter regions and determine the extent to which these genes have similar expression profiles.Results: We use the data sets from experiments onSaccharomyces cerevisiae.Our similarity measure for the promoter regions is based on the set of common mapped or putative transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements in the upstream region of the genes, as contained in theSaccharomyces cerevisiaePromoter Database.We pair up the genes with high similarity scores and compare their expression levels in time-course experiment data.We find that genes with similar promoter regions on the average have significantly higher correlation, but it can vary widely depending on the genes. This confirms that the presence of similar regulatory elements often does not correspond to similarity in expression profiles and indicates that finding transcription factor binding sites or other regulatory elements starting with the expression patterns may be limited in many cases.Regardless of the correlation, the degree to which the profiles agree under different experimental conditions can be examined to derive hypotheses concerning the role of common regulatory elements.Overall, we find that considering the relationship between the promoter regions and the expression profiles starting with the regulatory elements is a difficult but useful process that can provide valuable insights.Contact:peter_park@harvard.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1576/239281/Comparing-expression-profiles-of-genes-with	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1576	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Chalk,Erik L. L. Sonnhammer	NULL	Motivation: The expression of a gene can be selectively inhibited byantisense oligonucleotides (AOs) targeting the mRNA. However, if the targetsite in the mRNA is picked randomly, typically 20% or less of the AOs are effective inhibitorsin vivo. The sequence properties that make an AO effective are not well understood, thus many AOs need to be tested to findgood inhibitors, which is time consuming and costly. So far computationalmodels have been based exclusively on RNA structure prediction or motifsearches while ignoring information from other aspects of AO design into themodel.Results: We present a computational model for AO prediction based on aneural network approach using a broad range of input parameters. Collectingsequence and efficacy data from AO scanning experiments in the literaturegenerated a database of 490 AO molecules. Using a set of derived parametersbased on AO sequence properties we trained a neural network model. The bestmodel, an ensemble of 10 networks, gave an overall correlation coefficientof 0.30 (p=10−8). This model can predict effective AOs (>50% inhibition of gene expression) with a success rate of 92%. Using these thresholds the model predicts on average 12 effective AOs per 1000 basepairs, making it a stringent yet practical method for AO prediction.Availability: A prediction server is available athttp://www.cgb.ki.se/AOpredictContact:alistair.chalk@cgb.ki.se*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2002-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179951800004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/12/1567/239264/Computational-antisense-oligo-prediction-with-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.12.1567	NULL	http://www.cgb.ki.se/AOpredict,http://alistair.chalk@cgb.ki.se	NULL	NULL

SPEPlip identifies the presence of sorting signals and predicts their cleavage sites. The accuracy in cross-validation is similar to that of other available programs: the rate of false positives is 4 and 6%, for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively and that of false negatives is 3% in both cases. When a set of 409 prokaryotic lipoproteins is predicted, SPEPlip predicts 97% of the chains in the signal peptide class. However, by integrating SPEPlip with a regular expression search utility based on the PROSITE pattern, we can successfully discriminate signal peptide-containing chains from lipoproteins.

57	A CART-based approach to discover emerging patterns in microarray data	http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~socher/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	14	41	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Anne-Laure Boulesteix,Gerhard Tutz,Korbinian Strimmer	NULL	Motivation:Cancer diagnosis using gene expression profiles requires supervised learning and gene selection methods. Of the many suggested approaches, the method of emerging patterns (EPs) has the particular advantage of explicitly modeling interactions among genes, which improves classification accuracy. However, finding useful (i.e. short and statistically significant) EP is typically very hard.Methods:Here we introduce a CART-based approach to discover EPs in microarray data. The method is based on growing decision trees from which the EPs are extracted. This approach combines pattern search with a statistical procedure based on Fisher's exact test to assess the significance of each EP. Subsequently, sample classification based on the inferred EPs is performed using maximum-likelihood linear discriminant analysis.Results:Using simulated data as well as gene expression data from colon and leukemia cancer experiments we assessed the performance of our pattern search algorithm and classification procedure. In the simulations, our method recovers a large proportion of known EPs while for real data it is comparable in classification accuracy with three top-performing alternative classification algorithms. In addition, it assigns statistical significance to the inferred EPs and allows to rank the patterns while simultaneously avoiding overfit of the data. The new approach therefore provides a versatile and computationally fast tool for elucidating local gene interactions as well as for classification.Availability:A computer program written in the statistical language R implementing the new approach is freely available from the web pagehttp://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~socher/	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700018&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2465/194662/A-CART-based-approach-to-discover-emerging	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg361	NULL	http://boulesteix@stat.uni-muenchen.de,http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~socher/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

Sensitivity, selectivity and speed are three major yet usually conflicting evaluation criteria. The average precision (AP) measure aims to combine the sensitivity and selectivity features of a search algorithm. It can be easily visualized and extended to analyze results from a set of queries. Finally, the time–AP plot can clearly show the overall performance of different search methods.Results:Experiments are performed based on the SCOP database. Popular sequence comparison algorithms, namely Smith–Waterman (SSEARCH), FASTA, BLAST and PSI-BLAST are evaluated. We find that (1) the low-complexity segment filtration procedure in BLAST actually harms its overall search quality; (2) AP scores of different search methods are approximately in proportion of the logarithm of search time; and (3) homologs in protein families with many members tend to be more obscure than those in small families. This measure may be helpful for developing new search algorithms and can guide researchers in selecting most suitable search methods.Availability:Test sets and source code of this evaluation tool are available upon request.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2456/194566/Assessing-sequence-comparison-methods-with-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg349	NULL	http://cray@pku.edu.cn	NULL	NULL

Wright,Richard M. Simon	NULL	Motivation:Microarray techniques provide a valuable way of characterizing the molecular nature of disease. Unfortunately expense and limited specimen availability often lead to studies with small sample sizes. This makes accurate estimation of variability difficult, since variance estimates made on a gene by gene basis will have few degrees of freedom, and the assumption that all genes share equal variance is unlikely to be true.Results:We propose a model by which the within gene variances are drawn from an inverse gamma distribution, whose parameters are estimated across all genes. This results in a test statistic that is a minor variation of those used in standard linear models. We demonstrate that the model assumptions are valid on experimental data, and that the model has more power than standard tests to pick up large changes in expression, while not increasing the rate of false positives.Availability:This method is incorporated into BRB-ArrayTools version 3.0 (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html).Supplementary material:ftp://linus.nci.nih.gov/pub/techreport/RVM_supplement.pdf	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700015&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2448/194552/A-random-variance-model-for-detection-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg345	NULL	http://wrightge@mail.nih.gov,http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html	NULL	NULL
61	Accelerating screening of 3D protein data with a graph theoretical approach	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	1	6	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Cornelius Frömmel,Christoph Gille,Andrean Goede,Clemens Gröpl,Stefan Hougardy,Till Nierhoff,Robert Preißner,Martin Thimm	NULL	Motivation:The Dictionary of Interfaces in Proteins (DIP) is a database collecting the 3D structure of interacting parts of proteins that are called patches. It serves as a repository, in which patches similar to given query patches can be found. The computation of the similarity of two patches is time consuming and traversing the entire DIP requires some hours. In this work we address the question of how the patches similar to a given query can be identified by scanning only a small part of DIP. The answer to this question requires the investigation of the distribution of the similarity of patches.Results:The score values describing the similarity of two patches can roughly be divided into three ranges that correspond to different levels of spatial similarity. Interestingly, the two iso-score lines separating the three classes can be determined by two different approaches. Applying a concept of the theory of random graphs reveals significant structural properties of the data in DIP. These can be used to accelerate scanning the DIP for patches similar to a given query. Searches for very similar patches could be accelerated by a factor of more than 25. Patches with a medium similarity could be found 10 times faster than by brute-force search.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2442/194534/Accelerating-screening-of-3D-protein-data-with-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg343	NULL	http://christoph.gille@charite.de	NULL	NULL

63	Susceptibility of non-linear systems as an approach to metabolic responses	http://bbm1.ucm.es/torralba/funder/down/,http://bbm1.ucm.es/torralba/funder/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	0	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Antonio S. Torralba	NULL	Motivation:Recent developments of several analytical techniques and fast sampling procedures are making it possible to study non-linear dynamics on an automated basis. Approaches that suggest experimental setups and fully exploit the data are needed. To prevent unreliable fits of parameters to experimental data, model-independent methods would be advantageous. One such method consists in representing the response of a system by means of a transformation or functional, of an excitation, i.e. a flux of a metabolite.Results:A functional of unknown form can be expanded in series if its functional derivatives are known. An algorithm for calculating such generalized derivatives from impulse-perturbation experiments was developed. The only assumption was that the implicit kinetics is time-independent, i.e. the system is time-invariant. The method is illustrated on a part of fructose catabolism. A reaction network that involves 14 metabolites and 11 enzymes and includes several branches and feedback loops is considered.

By using these interfaces, many technical problems of database integration vanish and issues related to semantics remain, e.g. the use of different terms for the same things, different names for equivalent database attributes and missing links between relevant entries in different databases.Results:In this publication, principles and methods that were used to implement SEMEDA (Semantic Meta Database) are described. Database owners can use SEMEDA to provide semantically integrated access to their databases as well as to collaboratively edit and maintain ontologies and controlled vocabularies. Biologists can use SEMEDA to query the integrated databases in real time without having to know the structure or any technical details of the underlying databases.Availability:SEMEDA is available athttp://www-bm.ipk-gatersleben.de/semeda/.

65	Global snapshot of a protein interaction network—a percolation based approach	http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/SciTech/nano/msamanta/projects/percolation/index.php	ORIGINAL PAPERS	12	23	1	Bioinformatics Oxford	Chen-Shan Chin,Manoj Pratim Samanta	NULL	Motivation:Biologically significant information can be revealed by modeling large-scale protein interaction data using graph theory based network analysis techniques. However, the methods that are currently being used draw conclusions about the global features of the network from local connectivity data. A more systematic approach would be to define global quantities that measure (1) how strongly a protein ties with the other parts of the network and (2) how significantly an interaction contributes to the integrity of the network, and connect them with phenotype data from other sources. In this paper, we introduce such global connectivity measures and develop a stochastic algorithm based upon percolation in random graphs to compute them.Results:We show that, in terms of global connectivities, the distribution of essential proteins is distinct from the background. This observation highlights a fundamental difference between the essential and the non-essential proteins in the network. We also find that the interaction data obtained from different experimental methods such as immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid techniques contribute differently to network integrities. Such difference between different experimental methods can provide insight into the systematic bias present among these techniques.Supplementary information:The full list of our results can be found in the supplemental web sitehttp://www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/SciTech/nano/msamanta/projects/percolation/index.php	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2413/194483/Global-snapshot-of-a-protein-interaction-network-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg339	NULL	http://cschin@genome.ucsf.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL

Covitz,Frank Hartel,Carl Schaefer,Sherri De Coronado,Gilberto Fragoso,Himanso Sahni,Scott Gustafson,Kenneth H. Buetow	NULL	Motivation:Sites with substantive bioinformatics operations are challenged to build data processing and delivery infrastructure that provides reliable access and enables data integration. Locally generated data must be processed and stored such that relationships to external data sources can be presented. Consistency and comparability across data sets requires annotation with controlled vocabularies and, further, metadata standards for data representation. Programmatic access to the processed data should be supported to ensure the maximum possible value is extracted. Confronted with these challenges at the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics, we decided to develop a robust infrastructure for data management and integration that supports advanced biomedical applications.Results:We have developed an interconnected set of software and services called caCORE. Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) provide controlled vocabulary, dictionary and thesaurus services. The Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) provides a metadata registry for common data elements. Cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) implements an object-oriented model of the biomedical domain and provides Java, Simple Object Access Protocol and HTTP–XML application programming interfaces. caCORE has been used to develop scientific applications that bring together data from distinct genomic and clinical science sources.Availability:caCORE downloads and web interfaces can be accessed from links on the caCORE web site (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core). caBIO software is distributed under an open source license that permits unrestricted academic and commercial use.

Ryder,Teresa A. Webster,Shoulian Dong,Guoying Liu,Keith W. Jones,Giulia C. Kennedy,David Kulp	NULL	Motivation:Analysis of many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across whole genome is crucial to efficiently map disease genes and understanding susceptibility to diseases, drug efficacy and side effects for different populations and individuals. High density oligonucleotide microarrays provide the possibility for such analysis with reasonable cost. Such analysis requires accurate, reliable methods for feature extraction, classification, statistical modeling and filtering.Results:We propose the modified partitioning around medoids as a classification method for relative allele signals. We use the average silhouette width, separation and other quantities as quality measures for genotyping classification. We form robust statistical models based on the classification results and use these models to make genotype calls and calculate quality measures of calls. We apply our algorithms to several different genotyping microarrays. We use reference types, informative Mendelian relationship in families, and leave-one-out cross validation to verify our results. The concordance rates with the single base extension reference types are 99.36% for the SNPs on autosomes and 99.64% for the SNPs on sex chromosomes. The concordance of the leave-one-out test is over 99.5% and is 99.9% higher for AA, AB and BB cells. We also provide a method to determine the gender of a sample based on the heterozygous call rate of SNPs on the X chromosome. Seehttp://www.affymetrix.comfor further information.

68	Classification of protein quaternary structure with support vector machine	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	17	59	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Shao-Wu Zhang,Quan Pan,Hong-Cai Zhang,Yun-Long Zhang,Hai-Yu Wang	NULL	Motivation:Since the gap between sharply increasing known sequences and slow accumulation of known structures is becoming large, an automatic classification process based on the primary sequences and known three-dimensional structure becomes indispensable. The classification of protein quaternary structure based on the primary sequences can provide some useful information for the biologists. So a fully automatic and reliable classification system is needed. This work tries to look for the effective methods of extracting attribute and the algorithm for classifying the quaternary structure from the primary sequences.Results:Both of the support vector machine (SVM) and the covariant discriminant algorithms have been first introduced to predict quaternary structure properties from the protein primary sequences. The amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions based on the amino acid index profile of the primary sequence have been taken into account in the algorithms. We have analyzed 472 amino acid indices and selected the four amino acid indices as the examples, which have the best performance. Thus the five attribute parameter data sets (COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ) were established from the protein primary sequences. The COMP attribute data set is composed of amino acid composition, and the FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ attribute data sets are composed of the amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions of the corresponding amino acid residue index. The overall accuracies of SVM are 78.5, 87.5, 83.2, 81.7 and 81.9%, respectively, for COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ data sets in jackknife test, which are 19.6, 7.8, 15.5, 13.1 and 15.8%, respectively, higher than that of the covariant discriminant algorithm in the same test. The results show that SVM may be applied to discriminate between the primary sequences of homodimers and non-homodimers and the two protein sequence descriptors can reflect the quaternary structure information. Compared with previous Robert Garian's investigation, the performance of SVM is almost equal to that of the Decision tree models, and the methods of extracting feature vector from the primary sequences are superior to Robert's binning function method.Availability:Programs are available on request from the authors.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2390/194405/Classification-of-protein-quaternary-structure	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg331	NULL	http://quanpan@nwpu.edu.cn,http://shaowuzhang@hotmail.com	NULL	NULL
69	Scoring clustering solutions by their biological relevance	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	23	44	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	I. Gat-Viks,R. Sharan,R. Shamir	NULL	Motivation:A central step in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns. Clustering gene expression data into homogeneous groups was shown to be instrumental in functional annotation, tissue classification, regulatory motif identification, and other applications. Although there is a rich literature on clustering algorithms for gene expression analysis, very few works addressed the systematic comparison and evaluation of clustering results. Typically, different clustering algorithms yield different clustering solutions on the same data, and there is no agreed upon guideline for choosing among them.Results:We developed a novel statistically based method for assessing a clustering solution according to prior biological knowledge. Our method can be used to compare different clustering solutions or to optimize the parameters of a clustering algorithm. The method is based on projecting vectors of biological attributes of the clustered elements onto the real line, such that the ratio of between-groups and within-group variance estimators is maximized. The projected data are then scored using a non-parametric analysis of variance test, and the score's confidence is evaluated. We validate our approach using simulated data and show that our scoring method outperforms several extant methods, including the separation to homogeneity ratio and the silhouette measure. We apply our method to evaluate results of several clustering methods on yeast cell-cycle gene expression data.Availability:The software is available from the authors upon request.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2381/194390/Scoring-clustering-solutions-by-their-biological	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg330	NULL	http://iritg@post.tau.ac.il,http://rshamir@post.tau.ac.il,http://roded@icsi.berkeley.edu	NULL	NULL
70	Combining phylogenetic data with co-regulated genes to identify regulatory motifs	http://ural.wustl.edu/softwares.html	ORIGINAL PAPERS	46	177	1	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ting Wang,Gary D. Stormo	NULL	Motivation:Discovery of regulatory motifs in unaligned DNA sequences remains a fundamental problem in computational biology. Two categories of algorithms have been developed to identify common motifs from a set of DNA sequences. The first can be called a ‘multiple genes, single species’ approach. It proposes that a degenerate motif is embedded in some or all of the otherwise unrelated input sequences and tries to describe a consensus motif and identify its occurrences. It is often used for co-regulated genes identified through experimental approaches. The second approach can be called ‘single gene, multiple species’. It requires orthologous input sequences and tries to identify unusually well conserved regions by phylogenetic footprinting. Both approaches perform well, but each has some limitations. It is tempting to combine the knowledge of co-regulation among different genes and conservation among orthologous genes to improve our ability to identify motifs.Results:Based on the Consensus algorithm previously established by our group, we introduce a new algorithm called PhyloCon (Phylogenetic Consensus) that takes into account both conservation among orthologous genes and co-regulation of genes within a species. This algorithm first aligns conserved regions of orthologous sequences into multiple sequence alignments, or profiles, then compares profiles representing non-orthologous sequences. Motifs emerge as common regions in these profiles. Here we present a novel statistic to compare profiles of DNA sequences and a greedy approach to search for common subprofiles. We demonstrate that PhyloCon performs well on both synthetic and biological data.Availability:Software available upon request from the authors.http://ural.wustl.edu/softwares.html	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2369/194379/Combining-phylogenetic-data-with-co-regulated	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg329	NULL	http://stormo@ural.wustl.edu,http://ural.wustl.edu/softwares.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL
71	Efficient estimation of emission probabilities in profile hidden Markov models	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	6	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Virpi Ahola,Tero Aittokallio,Esa Uusipaikka,Mauno Vihinen	NULL	Motivation:Profile hidden Markov models provide a sensitive method for performing sequence database search and aligning multiple sequences. One of the drawbacks of the hidden Markov model is that the conserved amino acids are not emphasized, but signal and noise are treated equally. For this reason, the number of estimated emission parameters is often enormous. Focusing the analysis on conserved residues only should increase the accuracy of sequence database search.Results:We address this issue with a new method for efficient emission probability (EEP) estimation, in which amino acids are divided into effective and ineffective residues at each conserved alignment position. A practical study with 20 protein families demonstrated that the EEP method is capable of detecting family members from other proteins with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% on the average, even if the number of free emission parameters was decreased to 15% of the original. In the database search for TIM barrel sequences, EEP recognizes the family members nearly as accurately as HMMER or Blast, but the number of false positive sequences was significantly less than that obtained with the other methods.Availability:The algorithms written in C language are available on request from the authors.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2359/194368/Efficient-estimation-of-emission-probabilities-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg328	NULL	http://virahola@utu.fi	NULL	NULL
72	JXP4BIGI: a generalized, Java XML-based approach for biological information gathering and integration	http://www.ikbar.org/,http://www.ikbar.org/jxp4bigi/demo.html	ORIGINAL PAPERS	12	6	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yihua Huang,Tianyun Ni,Lei Zhou,Stanley Su	NULL	Motivation:In the post-genomic era, biologists interested in systems biology often need to import data from public databases and construct their own system-specific or subject-oriented databases to support their complex analysis and knowledge discovery. To facilitate the analysis and data processing, customized and centralized databases are often created by extracting and integrating heterogeneous data retrieved from public databases. A generalized methodology for accessing, extracting, transforming and integrating the heterogeneous data is needed.Results:This paper presents a new data integration approach named JXP4BIGI (JavaXMLPage forBiologicalInformationGathering andIntegration). The approach provides a system-independent framework, which generalizes and streamlines the steps of accessing, extracting, transforming and integrating the data retrieved from heterogeneous data sources to build a customized data warehouse. It allows the data integrator of a biological database to define the desired bio-entities in XML templates (or Java XML pages), and use embedded extended SQL statements to extract structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from public databases. By running the templates in the JXP4BIGI framework and using a number of generalized wrappers, the required data from public databases can be efficiently extracted and integrated to construct the bio-entities in the XML format without having to hard-code the extraction logics for different data sources. The constructed XML bio-entities can then be imported into either a relational database system or a native XML database system to build a biological data warehouse.Availability:JXP4BIGI has been integrated and tested in conjunction with the IKBAR system (http://www.ikbar.org/) in two integration efforts to collect and integrate data for about 200 human genes related to cell death from HUGO, Ensembl, and SWISS-PROT (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000), and about 700Drosophilagenes from FlyBase (FlyBase Consortium, 2002). The integrated data has been used in comparative genomic analysis of x-ray induced cell death. Also, as explained later, JXP4BIGI is a middleware and framework to be integrated with biological database applications, and cannot run as a stand-alone software for end users.

Landais,M. Ogliastro,K. Mita,J. Nohata,M. López-Ferber,M. Duonor-Cérutti,T. Shimada,P. Fournier,G. Devauchelle	NULL	Motivation:A whole set of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from theSf9 cell line ofSpodoptera frugiperdais presented here for the first time. By this way we want to identify both conserved and specific genes of this pest species. We also expect from this analysis to find a class of protein sequences providing a tool to explore genomic features and phylogeny of Lepidoptera.Results:The ESTs display both housekeeping as well as developmentally regulated genes, and a high percentage of sequences with unknown function. Among the identified ORFs, almost all ribosomal proteins (RPs) were found with high EST redundancy and hence sequence accuracy. The codon usage found among RP genes is in average surprisingly much less biased in Lepidoptera than in other organisms. OtherSpodopteragenes also displayed a low bias, suggesting a general genome expression feature in this Lepidoptera. We also found that the L35A and L36 RP sequences, respectively, display 40 and 10 amino-acid insertions, both being present only in insects. Sequence analysis suggests that they are probably not subjected to a strong selective pressure and may be good phylogenetic markers for Lepidoptera. Most interestingly, the Lepidoptera sequences of 9 RP genes displayed a specific signature different from the canonical one. We conclude that the RP family allows valuable comparative genomics and phylogeny of Lepidoptera.Availability:All EST sequence data are available from the private ‘Spodo-Base’ upon request.	2003-12-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000187217700002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/18/2343/194318/Annotation-pattern-of-ESTs-from-Spodoptera	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg324	NULL	http://devauche@ales.inra.fr	NULL	NULL

In this paper I describe an approach to semanticdeclaration intended to permit independent, distributed databases,algorithms, and servers to exchange and process requests forinformation and computations without requiring coordination oragreement among them on universe of discourse, data model, schema,or implementation.Results: This approach usesGlossa, a formal languagedefining the semantics of biological ideas, information, andalgorithms, toexecutablydefine the semantics of complexideas and computations by constructs ofsemiotes, termswhich axiomatically define very simple notions. A database oralgorithm wishing to exchange information or computations maintainsa set of mappings between its particular notions and semiotes, and aparser to translate between its indigenous ideas and implementationand the semiotes. Requests from other databases or algorithms areissued as semiotic messages, locally interpreted and processed, andthe results returned as semiotes to the requesting entity. Thus,semiotes serve as a shared, abstract layer of definitions which canbe computably combined by each database or algorithm according toits own needs and ideas. By combining the explicit declaration ofsemantics with the computation of the semantics of complex ideas,Glossaand its semiotes permit independent computationalentities to lightly federate their capabilities as desired whilemaintaining their unique perspectives on both scientific andtechnical questions.Availability:http://www.ibc.wustl.edu/agora/semiotes/andfiles therein.Contact:toni@athe.wustl.edu	2000-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166611200009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/12/1129/214652/Semiotes-a-semantics-for-sharing	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.12.1129	NULL	http://www.ibc.wustl.edu/agora/semiotes/,http://toni@athe.wustl.edu	NULL	NULL

Blundell	NULL	Motivation: Structural alignments of superfamily members oftenexhibit insertions and deletions of secondary structure elements(SSEs), yet conserved subsets of SSEs appear to be important formaintaining the fold and facilitating common functionalities.Results: A database of aligned SSEs was constructed from thestructure-based alignments of protein superfamily members in theCAMPASS database. SSEs were classified into several types on thebasis of their length and solvent accessibility and counts were madefor the replacements of SSEs in different types at structurallyaligned positions. The results, summarized as log-odds substitutionmatrices, can be used for two types of comparisons: (1) structureagainst structure, both with secondary structure assignments; and(2) structure against sequence with predicted secondary structures.The conservation of SSEs at each alignment position was defined asthe deviation of observed SSE frequencies from the uniformdistribution. This offers a useful resource to define and examinethe core of superfamily folds. Even when the structure of only asingle member of a superfamily is known, the extended method can beused to predict the conservation of SSEs. Such information will beuseful when modelling the structure of other members of asuperfamily or identifying structurally and functionally importantpositions in the fold.Availability: The database is available on the world wide web athttp://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~kenji/ssdb/.The conservation of SSEs was translated into colour values and canbe visualized through the web interface.Contact:kenji@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166611200007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/12/1111/214619/Analysis-of-conservation-and-substitutions-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.12.1111	NULL	http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~kenji/ssdb/,http://kenji@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

  search used to detect distant homology"	http://bioinformatics.burnham-inst.org/xblast,http://liwz@sdsc.edu,http://adam@burnham-inst.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	18	41	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Weizhong Li,Frederic Pio,Krzysztof Pawłowski,Adam Godzik	NULL	Motivation: Two proteins can have a similar 3-dimensionalstructure and biological function, but have sequences sufficientlydifferent that traditional protein sequence comparison algorithms donot identify their relationship. The desire to identify suchrelations has led to the development of more sensitive sequencealignment strategies. One such strategy is the Intermediate SequenceSearch (ISS), which connects two proteins through one or moreintermediate sequences. In its brute-force implementation, ISS is astrategy that repetitively uses the results of the previous query asnew search seeds, making it time-consuming and difficult toanalyze.Results: Saturated BLAST is a package that performs ISS in anefficient and automated manner. It was developed using Perl andPerl/Tk and implemented on the LINUX operating system. Starting witha protein sequence, Saturated BLAST runs a BLAST search andidentifies representative sequences for the next generation ofsearches.

93	Protein domain decomposition using a graph-theoretic approach	http://compbio.ornl.gov/structure/domainparser/,http://xyn@ornl.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	30	68	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ying Xu,Dong Xu,Harold N. Gabow	NULL	Motivation: Automatic decomposition of a multi-domain proteininto individual domains represents a highly interesting and unsolvedproblem. As the number of protein structures in PDB is growing at anexponential rate, there is clearly a need for more reliable andefficient methods for protein domain decomposition simply to keepthe domain databases up-to-date.Results: We present a new algorithm for solving the domaindecomposition problem, using a graph-theoretic approach. We haveformulated the problem as a network flow problem, in which eachresidue of a protein is represented as a node of the network andeach residue–residue contact is represented as an edge with aparticularcapacity, depending on the type of the contact.A two-domain decomposition problem is solved by finding a bottleneck(or a minimum cut) of the network, which minimizes the totalcross-edge capacity, using the classical Ford–Fulkersonalgorithm. A multi-domain decomposition problem is solved throughrepeatedly solving a series of two-domain problems. The algorithmhas been implemented as a computer program, calledDomainParser. We have tested the program on a commonly usedtest set consisting of 55 proteins. The decomposition results are78.2% in agreement with the literature on both the number ofdecomposed domains and the assignments of residues to each domain,which compares favorably to existing programs. On the subset oftwo-domain proteins (20 in number), the program assigned 96.7% ofthe residues correctly when we require that the number of decomposeddomains is two.Availability: The executable of DomainParser and its web serverare available athttp://compbio.ornl.gov/structure/domainparser/.Contact:xyn@ornl.gov*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166611200005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/12/1091/214575/Protein-domain-decomposition-using-a-graph	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.12.1091	NULL	http://compbio.ornl.gov/structure/domainparser/,http://xyn@ornl.gov	NULL	NULL

Thecheckpoint algorithm introduced by Griceet al.(CABIOS,13, 45–53, 1997) runs inO(Lmn)time andO(LmL√n)space,whereLis a positive integer determined bym,n, and the amount of available workspace. The algorithm isappropriate for many string comparison problems, including all-pathsand single-best-path hidden Markov model training, and is readilyparallelizable. The checkpoint algorithm has a diagonal version thatcan solve the single-best-path alignment problem inO(mn)timeandO(m + n)space.Results: In this work, we improve performance by analyzingoptimal checkpoint placement. The improved row checkpoint algorithmperforms up to one half the computation of the original algorithm.The improved diagonal checkpoint algorithm performs up to 35% fewercomputational steps than the original. We modified the SAM hiddenMarkov modeling package to use the improved row checkpointalgorithm. For a fixed sequence length, the new version is up to 33%faster for all-paths and 56% faster for single-best-path HMMtraining, depending on sequence length and allocated memory. Over atypical set of protein sequence lengths, the improvement is~10%.Availability: The SAM hidden Markov modeling package is freelyavailable for academic use fromhttp://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html.The C++code used to find optimal checkpoint placements isavailable fromhttp://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/kestrel.Contact:rph@cse.ucsc.edu2Current address: Neomorphic, 2612 8th St.,Berkeley, CA 94710, USA.3To whom correspondence may beaddressed.	2000-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166611200004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/12/1082/214553/Optimizing-reduced-space-sequence-analysis	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.12.1082	NULL	http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html,http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/kestrel,http://rph@cse.ucsc.edu	NULL	NULL

Ifnumerical values are assigned to each of these characters, then theresulting numerical sequences are readily amenable to digital signalprocessing.Results: We introduce new computational and visual tools forbiomolecular sequences analysis. In particular, we provide anoptimization procedure improving upon traditional Fourier analysisperformance in distinguishing coding from noncoding regions in DNAsequences. We also show that the phase of a properly defined Fouriertransform is a powerful predictor of the reading frame of proteincoding regions. Resulting color maps help in visually identifyingnot only the existence of protein coding areas for both DNA strands,but also the coding direction and the reading frame for each of theexons.

Ersoy,Minou Bina	NULL	Motivation: Many problems in molecular biology as well as otherareas involve detection of rare events in unbalanced data. Wedevelop two sample stratification schemes in conjunction with neuralnetworks for rare event detection in such databases. Samplestratification is a technique for making each class in a sample haveequal influence on decision making. The first scheme proposedstratifies a sample by adding up the weighted sum of the derivativesduring the backward pass of training. The second scheme proposeduses a technique of modified bootstrap aggregating. After trainingneural networks with multiple sets of bootstrapped examples of therare event classes and subsampled examples of common event classes,multiple voting for classification is performed.Results: These two schemes make rare event classes have a betterchance of being included in the sample used for training neuralnetworks and thus improve the classification accuracy for rare eventdetection. The experimental performance of the two schemes using twosets of human DNA sequences as well as another set of Gaussian dataindicates that proposed schemes have the potential of significantlyimproving accuracy of neural networks to recognize rare events.Availability: Web service is athttp://128.46.200.193/sharing/bioinfo.Contact:wooyoung@ecn.purdue.edu;ersoy@ecn.purdue.edu	2000-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166611200002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/12/1062/214506/Neural-network-schemes-for-detecting-rare-events	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.12.1062	NULL	http://128.46.200.193/sharing/bioinfo,http://wooyoung@ecn.purdue.edu,http://ersoy@ecn.purdue.edu	NULL	NULL

Correlations between the levels of various metabolitescan be searched to gain information about metabolic links. Suchcorrelations are the net result of direct enzymatic conversions andof indirect cellular regulation over transcriptional or biochemicalprocesses. In order to visualize metabolic networks derived fromcorrelation lists graphically, each metabolite pair may berepresented as vertices connected by an edge. However, graphcomplexity rapidly increases with the number of edges and vertices.To gain structural information from metabolite correlation networks,improvements in clarity are needed.Results: To achieve this clarity, three algorithms are combined.First, a list of linear metabolite correlations is generated thatcan be regarded as a set of pairs of edges (or as 2-cliques). Next,a branch-and-bound algorithm was developed to find all maximalcliques by combining submaximal cliques. Due to a clique assignmentprocedure, the generation of unnecessary submaximal cliques isavoided in order to maintain high efficiency. Differences andsimilarities to the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm are pointed out.Lastly, metabolite correlation networks are visualized byclique–metabolite matrices that are sorted to minimize thelength of lines that connect different cliques and metabolites.Examples of biochemical hypotheses are given that can be built frominterpretation of such clique matrices.Availability: The algorithms are implemented in Visual Basic andcan be downloaded from our web site along with a test data set(http://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/fiehn/projekte/data-mining-e.html).Contact:kose@mpimp-golm.mpg.de*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000173050500013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1198/225504/Visualizing-plant-metabolomic-correlation-networks	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1198	NULL	http://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/fiehn/projekte/data-mining-e.html,http://kose@mpimp-golm.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

Its core task is to identify thecausal structure of a gene network, that is, to distinguish directfrom indirect regulatory interactions among gene products. In otherwords, to reconstruct a genetic network is to identify, for eachnetwork gene, which other genes and their activity the geneinfluences directly. Crucial to this task are perturbations of geneactivity. Genomic technology permits large-scale experimentsperturbing the activity of many genes and assessing the effect ofeach perturbation on all other genes in a genome. However, suchexperiments cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effectsof a genetic perturbation.Results: I present an algorithm to reconstruct direct regulatoryinteractions in gene networks from the results of gene perturbationexperiments. The algorithm is based on a graph representation ofgenetic networks and applies to networks of arbitrary size andcomplexity. Algorithmic complexity in both storage and time is low,less thanO(n2).

Thecorresponding focus on shared novel character states yields a fastand transparent phylogeny estimation algorithm, by application ofthe divide-and-conquer principle, and heuristic search: sharednovelties give evidence of the exclusive common heritage (monophyly)of a subset of the species. They indicate conflict in a split of allspecies considered, if the split tears them apart. Only the split atthe root of the phylogenetic tree cannot have such conflict.Therefore, we can work top-down, from the root to the leaves, byheuristically searching for a minimum-conflict split, and tacklingthe resulting two subsets in the same way. The algorithm, called‘minimum conflict phylogeny estimation’(mcope), has been validated successfully using bothnatural and artificial data. In particular, we reanalyze publishedtrees, yielding more plausible phylogenies, and we analyze small‘undisputed’ trees on the basis of alignmentsconsidering structural homology.Availability:mcopeis available viahttp://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/mcope/.Contact:fuellen@alum.mit.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000173050500010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1168/225400/Minimum-conflict-a-divide-and-conquer-approach-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1168	NULL	http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/mcope/,http://fuellen@alum.mit.edu	NULL	NULL

Inthis paper, all pairs of domains from 250 sequences belonging todifferent SCOP folds were aligned andZ-scores calculated.The distribution ofZ-scores was fitted with a peakdistribution from which the probability of obtaining a givenZ-score from the global alignment of two protein sequences ofunrelated fold was calculated. A similar analysis was applied tosubsequence pairs found by the Smith–Waterman algorithm. Theseanalyses allow the probability that two protein sequences share thesame fold to be estimated by global sequence alignment.Results: The relationship betweenZ-score and probabilityvaried little over the matrix/gap penalty combinations examined.However, an average shift of+4.7was observed forZ-scores derived from global alignment of locally-alignedsubsequences compared to global alignment of the full-lengthsequences. This shift was shown to be the result of pre-selection bylocal alignment, rather than any structural similarity in thesubsequences. The search ability of both methods was benchmarkedagainst the SCOP superfamily classification and showed that globalalignmentZ-scores generated from the entire sequence are aseffective as SSEARCH at low error rates and more effective at highererror rates. However, global alignmentZ-scores generatedfrom the best locally-aligned subsequence were significantly lesseffective than SSEARCH. The method of estimating statisticalsignificance described here was shown to give similar values toSSEARCH and BLAST, providing confidence in the significanceestimation.Availability: Software to apply the statistics to globalalignments is available fromhttp://barton.ebi.ac.uk.Contact:geoff@ebi.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should be addressed.Present address: School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, DowSt., Dundee, DD1 5EH.	2001-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000173050500009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1158/225371/Estimation-of-P-values-for-global-alignments-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1158	NULL	http://barton.ebi.ac.uk,http://geoff@ebi.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

The abundant data areanalyzed by clustering procedures to extract the useful informationabout the genes inherent in the data. In the clustering analyses,the systematic determination of the boundaries of gene clusters,instead of by visual inspection and biological knowledge, stillremains challenging.Results: We propose a statistical procedure to estimate thenumber of clusters in the hierarchical clustering of the expressionprofiles. Following the hierarchical clustering, the statisticalproperty of the profiles at the node in the dendrogram is evaluatedby a statistics-based value: the variance inflation factor in themultiple regression analysis. The evaluation leads to an automaticdetermination of the cluster boundaries without any additionalanalyses and any biological knowledge of the measured genes.

We tested the algorithm oncolon and leukemia data sets. As an extension to our earlier work,we systematically examine the sensitivity, reproducibility andstability of gene selection/sample classification to the choice ofparameters of the algorithm.Methods: Our approach combines aGenetic Algorithm (GA) and thek-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)method to identify genes that canjointlydiscriminate betweendifferent classes of samples (e.g. normal versus tumor). The GA/KNNmethod is a stochastic supervised pattern recognition method. Thegenes identified are subsequently used to classify independent testset samples.Results: The GA/KNN method is capable of selecting a subset ofpredictive genes from a large noisy data set for sampleclassification. It is a multivariate approach that can capture thecorrelated structure in the data. We find that for a given data setgene selection is highly repeatable in independent runs using theGA/KNN method.

Salzberg	NULL	As the pace of genome sequencing has accelerated, the needfor highly accurate gene prediction systems has grown. Computationalsystems for identifying genes in prokaryotic genomes havesensitivities of 98–99% or higher (Delcheret al.,Nucleic Acids Res.,27, 4636–4641, 1999).These accuracy figures are calculated by comparing the locations ofverified stop codons to the predictions. Determining the accuracy ofstart codon prediction is more problematic, however, due to therelatively small number of start sites that have been confirmed byindependent, non-computational methods. Nonetheless, the accuracy ofgene finders at predicting the exact gene boundaries at both the5′ and 3′ ends of genes is of criticalimportance for microbial genome annotation, especially in light ofthe important signaling information that is sometimes found on the5′ end of a protein coding region. In this paper wepropose a probabilistic method to improve the accuracy of geneidentification systems at finding precise translation start sites.The new system, RBSfinder, is tested on a validated set of genes fromEscherichia coli, for which it improves the accuracy ofstart site locations predicted by computational gene finding systemsfrom the range 67–77% to 90% correct.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000173050500005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1123/225268/A-probabilistic-method-for-identifying-start	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1123	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Ray,Robert S. Munson Jr,Charles J. Daniels	NULL	Motivation: The process of determining the functionalsequencecontent of an organism is confounded by several factors.Large protein coding sequences are relatively easy to find bystatistical methods. Smaller proteins however may escape detectiondue to their size falling below some arbitrary researcher-definedminimum cutoff, or the inability to precisely define a promoter, ortranslational start (Delcheret al.,Nucleic AcidsRes.,27, 4636–4641, 1999). Promoter andregulatory sequences themselves are difficult to define due to asignificant amount of allowable sequence variation, as well as aprobable lack of any completely accurate whole-organismal genecatalogs to date. Finally, certain genes coding functional RNAs mayhave insufficient structural or sequence constraints to bedetectable by normal sequence structure/pattern searching methods(Eddy and Rivas,Bioinformatics,16, 583–605,2000).In those cases where there are multiple closely relatedorganisms that have been sequenced, there is additional informationthat may be used in the investigation of sequence content—thatbeing the possible conserved nature of functional sequences betweenthe organisms.We present a method for the utilization of thisconserved information to detect genes and other potentiallyfunctional sequences that may be missed by standard ORF-calling, RNAfinding, and pattern matching software. Thetricrossprograms produce a multi-way cross comparison of three sets ofsequences, determine which are conserved in all three sets, andproduce a graphical (Virtual Reality Modelling Language—VRML;(ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997, VDC), 1997) representation as well asalignments of all sequence triples found. The software can also beapplied to a pair of sequence sets, though the noise in the resultsincreases.Results:Tricrosshas been used to examine theintergenic-sequence content of the three archaeal Pyrococcus genomesto determine the most highly related sequences remaining between theannotated protein and RNA coding sequences. Set to relativelystringent similarity requirements for the search,tricrossfound 101 intergenic sequences conserved among the three organisms.Interestingly, 29 of these appear to contain members of a family ofsmall RNA molecules (Kiss-Laszloet al.,EMBO J.,17, 797–807, 1998) only recently discovered in theArchaea (Armbruster, OSU, Diss., 1988; Omeret al.,Science,288, 517–522, 2000; Gaspinetal.,J. Mol. Biol.,297, 895–906,2000). While some of the remaining 72 appear to be individual highlyconserved promoter sequences, others have no currently knownbiological significance. Although originally developed to facilitatethe examination of intergenic sequences, none of thetricrosslogic is inherently specific to intergenicsequences. The software can also be applied to gene sequences, andhas been used to produce inter-genomic gene order dot-plots forHaemophilus influenzae (Fleischmannet al.,Science,269, 496–512, 1995) versus H.ducreyi(unpublished data), and Neisseria meningiditis Z2491 (serogroup A)(Parkhillet al.,Nature,404,502–506, 2000) versus Neisseria meningiditis Z58 (serogroup B)(Tettelinet al.,Science,287,1809–1815, 2000) versus Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Lewisetal.,http://micro-gen.ouhsc.edu/,2000).Availability: Thetricrosssoftware package is availablefromhttp://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html.Contact:ray@biosci.ohio-state.edu;daniels.7@osu.edu;munsonr@pediatrics.ohio-state.eduSupplementaryinformation: Additional data from the cross-genomic comparisonsexamined in the discussion section are linked fromhttp://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000173050500003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1105/225210/Tricross-using-dot-plots-in-sequence-id-space-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1105	NULL	http://micro-gen.ouhsc.edu/,http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html,http://ray@biosci.ohio-state.edu,http://daniels.7@osu.edu,http://munsonr@pediatrics.ohio-state.edu,http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html	NULL	NULL

This step isnecessary before other genomic data processing stages can be carriedout, such as fragment assembly or EST clustering. A specialized toolis therefore needed to solve this apparent dilemma.Results: We have designed and implemented a program thatspecifically addresses the problem.

A variety of theoretical foundations are beingused to derive alignment-free methods that overcome this limitation. Theformulation of alternative metrics for dissimilarity between sequences andtheir algorithmic implementations are reviewed.Results: The overwhelming majority of work on alignment-free sequence has taken placein the past two decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years.Two main categories of methods have been proposed—methods based on word(oligomer) frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequencewith fixed word length segments. The first category is based on thestatistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian spacedefined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content offrequency distribution. The second category includes the use of Kolmogorovcomplexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility, alignment-freemetrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection filters foralignment-based querying of large applications. Recent work is furtheringtheir usage as a scale-independent methodology that is capable ofrecognizing homology when loss of contiguity is beyond the possibility ofalignment.Availability: Most of the alignment-free algorithms reviewed were implemented in MATLABcode and are available athttp://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.htmlContact:almeidaj@musc.edu;svinga@itqb.unl.pt*To whom correspondence should be addressed.	2003-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181410700010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/4/513/218529/Alignment-free-sequence-comparison-a-review	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg005	NULL	http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.html,http://almeidaj@musc.edu,http://svinga@itqb.unl.pt	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=qqqqwwww	NULL

For all-alphatransmembrane proteins we use both the standard Kyte–Doolittle (KD) hydropathyscale and the TMHMM predictor (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/).Using a set of 188 well characterized membrane proteins, MaxSubSeq nearly doubles the correct location oftransmembrane segments as compared to the standard KD hydrophobicity plot,reaching 51% accuracy. If MaxSubSeq is used to optimize the TMHMM method the accuracy increases from 68 to 72%. When used to regularize the prediction of beta transmembrane strands,obtained using both a neural network and a HMM based predictors, MaxSubSeq increases the accuracy per protein up to 72 and 73%respectively.Availability: The program is available upon request to the authors, or it is accessible through ourweb server (http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/predictors/)Contact:piero@biocomp.unibo.itcasadio@alma.unibo.it*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181410700008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/4/500/218812/MaxSubSeq-an-algorithm-for-segment-length	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg023	NULL	http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/,http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/predictors/,http://piero@biocomp.unibo.it,http://casadio@alma.unibo.it	NULL	NULL
122	Statistical alignment based on fragment insertion and deletion models	http://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~stoch/software/mcmcsalut,http://dmetzler@math.uni-frankfurt.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	37	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Dirk Metzler	NULL	Motivation: The topic of this paper is the estimation of alignments and mutation rates based on stochastic sequence–evolution models that allow insertions and deletions of subsequences (‘fragments’) and not just single bases. The model we propose is a variant of a model introducedby Thorneet al., (J. Mol. Evol.,34, 3–16, 1992). The computational tractability of the model depends on certain restrictions in the insertion/deletionprocess; possible effects we discuss.Results: The process of fragment insertion and deletion in the sequence–evolution model induces a hidden Markovstructure at the level of alignments and thus makes possible efficient statistical alignment algorithms. As an example we apply a samplingprocedure to assess the variability in alignment and mutation parameter estimates for HVR1 sequences of human and orangutan, improving results of previous work. Simulation studies give evidence that estimation methods based on the proposed model also give satisfactory results when applied todata for which the restrictions in the insertion/deletion process do not hold.Availability: The source code of the software for sampling alignments and mutation rates for a pair of DNA sequencesaccording to the fragment insertion and deletion model isfreely available fromhttp://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~stoch/software/mcmcsalutunder the terms of the GNU public license (GPL, 2000).Contact:dmetzler@math.uni-frankfurt.de	2003-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181410700007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/4/490/218888/Statistical-alignment-based-on-fragment-insertion	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg026	NULL	http://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~stoch/software/mcmcsalut,http://dmetzler@math.uni-frankfurt.de	NULL	NULL

The quality of a library frequently depends on itscompleteness, or diversity—the proportion of possible sequences actuallypresent in the library. The diversity of these libraries is frequentlyquoted on the basis of phage titers that provide little information abouttheir completeness.Results: Here, an analytical expression fordiversity is introduced and a method for estimating the diversity of apeptide library from the sequences of a limited number of the members of thelibrary is demonstrated.

PLS has major advantages foranalyzing microarray data since it can model data sets with large numbers ofvariables and with few observations.A response model was derived describing the expression profile over timeexpected for periodically transcribed genes, and was used to identifybudding yeast transcripts with similar profiles. PLS was then used tointerpret the importance of the variables (genes) for the model, yielding aranking list of how well the genes fitted the generated model. Applicationof an appropriate cutoff value, calculated from randomized data, allows theidentification of genes whose expression appears to be synchronized withcell cycling. Our approach also provides information about the stage in thecell cycle where their transcription peaks.Three synchronized yeast cell microarray data sets were analyzed, bothseparately and combined. Cell cycle-coupled periodicity was suggested for455 of the 6,178 transcripts monitored in the combined data set, at asignificance level of 0.5%. Among the candidates, 85% of the knownperiodic transcripts were included.

Biologists are attempting to group genes based on the temporal pattern of their expression levels. While the use of hierarchical clustering (UPGMA) with correlation‘ distance’ has been the most common in the microarray studies, there are many more choices of clustering algorithms in pattern recognition and statistics literature. At the moment there do not seem to be any clear-cut guidelines regarding the choice of a clustering algorithm to be used for grouping genes based on their expression profiles.Results: In this paper, we consider six clustering algorithms (of various flavors!) and evaluate their performances on a well-known publicly available microarray data set on sporulation of budding yeast and on two simulated data sets. Among other things, we formulate three reasonable validation strategies that can be used with any clustering algorithm when temporal observations or replications are present. We evaluate each of these six clustering methods with these validation measures. While the ‘best’ method is dependent on the exact validation strategy and the number of clusters to be used, overallDianaappears to be a solid performer. Interestingly, the performance of correlation-based hierarchical clustering and model-based clustering (another method that has been advocated by a number of researchers) appear to be on opposite extremes, depending on what validation measure one employs. Next it is shown that the group means produced byDianaare the closest and those produced by UPGMA are the farthest from a model profile based on a set of hand-picked genes.Availability: S+ codes for the partial least squares based clustering are available from the authors upon request.

The purpose of this study was to investigateinformation theoretic data mining approaches to discover temporal patternsof gene expression from array-derived gene expression data.Results: The Kullback–Leibler divergence, an information-theoreticdistance that measures the relative dissimilarity between two datadistribution profiles, was used in conjunction with an unsupervisedself-organizing map algorithm.

129	Can transcriptome size be estimated from SAGE catalogs?	http://sternm@grc.nia.nih.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	7	21	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Michael D. Stern,Sergey V. Anisimov,Kenneth R. Boheler	NULL	Motivation: SAGE (SerialAnalysis ofGeneExpression) can be used to estimate the number of uniquetranscripts in a transcriptome. A simple estimator that corrects forsequencing and sampling errors was applied to a SAGE library (137 832 tags)obtained from mouse embryonic stem cells, and also to Monte Carlo simulatedlibraries generated using assumed distributions of‘ true’ expression levelsconsistent with the data.Results: When the corrected data themselves were taken asthe underlying model of ‘ground truth’, the estimator converged to the ‘ true’ value (53 535) only after counting 300 000 simulated tags, more thantwice the number in the experiment. The SAGE data could also be well fit bya Monte Carlo model based on a truncated inverse-square distribution ofexpression levels, with 130 000 ‘true’ transcripts and 106samples needed for convergence. We conclude that the size of a transcriptome isill-determined from SAGE libraries of even moderately large size. In orderto obtain a valid estimate, one must sample a number of tags inverselyproportional to the lowest abundance level, which is not knowna priori. This constrains the design of SAGE experiments intended to determine biologicalcomplexity.Availability: The ‘homemade’ software used for thisanalysis was not designed for general or ‘production’ use, but the authorswill be happy to share Fortran sourcecode with interested parties.Contact:sternm@grc.nia.nih.gov*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181410700001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/4/443/218693/Can-transcriptome-size-be-estimated-from-SAGE	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg018	NULL	http://sternm@grc.nia.nih.gov	NULL	NULL

and S-system"	http://kikuchi@sfc.keio.ac.jp	ORIGINAL PAPER	125	238	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Shinichi Kikuchi,Daisuke Tominaga,Masanori Arita,Katsutoshi Takahashi,Masaru Tomita	NULL	Motivation: The modeling of system dynamics of genetic networks, metabolic networks or signal transduction cascades from time-course data is formulated as a reverse-problem. Previous studies focused on the estimation of onlynetwork structures, and they were ineffective in inferring a network structure with feedback loops. We previously proposed a method to predict not only the network structure but also its dynamics using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and an S-system formalism. However, it could predict only a small number of parameters and could rarely obtain essential structures. In this work, we propose a unified extension of the basic method. Notable improvements are as follows: (1) an additional term in its evaluation function that aims at eliminating futile parameters; (2) a crossover method called Simplex Crossover (SPX) to improve its optimization ability; and (3) a gradual optimization strategy to increase the number of predictable parameters.Results: The proposed method is implemented as a C program called PEACE1 (Predictor by Evolutionary Algorithms and Canonical Equations 1). Its performance was compared with the basic method. The comparison showed that: (1) the convergence rate increased about 5-fold; (2) the optimization speed was raised about 1.5-fold; and (3) the number of predictable parameters was increased about 5-fold. Moreover, we successfully inferred the dynamics of a small genetic network constructed with 60 parameters for 5 network variables and feedback loops using only time-course data of gene expression.Contact:kikuchi@sfc.keio.ac.jp*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/643/239103/Dynamic-modeling-of-genetic-networks-using-genetic	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg027	NULL	http://kikuchi@sfc.keio.ac.jp	NULL	NULL

Brunak	NULL	Motivation: The human genome project has led to the discovery of many human protein coding genes which were previously unknown. As a large fraction of these are functionally uncharacterized, it is of interest to develop methods for predicting their molecular function from sequence.Results: We have developed a method for prediction of protein function for a subset of classes from the Gene Ontology classification scheme. This subset includes several pharmaceutically interesting categories—transcription factors, receptors, ion channels, stress and immune response proteins, hormones and growth factors can all be predicted. Although the method relies on protein sequences as the sole input, it does not rely on sequence similarity, but instead on sequence derived protein features such as predicted post translational modifications (PTMs), protein sorting signals and physical/chemical properties calculated from the amino acid composition. This allows for prediction of the function for orphan proteins where no homologs can be found. Using this method we propose two novel receptors in the human genome, and further demonstrate chromosomal clustering of related proteins.Availability: Sequences can be submitted to the prediction server via a web interface athttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProtFun/Contact:ljj@cbs.dtu.dk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/635/239358/Prediction-of-human-protein-function-according-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg036	NULL	http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProtFun/,http://ljj@cbs.dtu.dk	NULL	NULL

Ferrin	NULL	Motivation: Existing algorithms for automated protein structure alignment generate contradictory results and are difficult to interpret. An algorithm which can provide a context for interpreting the alignment and uses a simple method to characterize protein structure similarity is needed.Results: We describe a heuristic for limiting the search space for structure alignment comparisons between two proteins, and an algorithm for finding minimal root-mean-squared-distance (RMSD) alignments as a function of the number of matching residue pairs within this limited search space. Our alignment algorithm uses coordinates of alpha-carbon atoms to represent each amino acid residue and requires a total computation time ofO(m3n2), wheremandndenote the lengths of the protein sequences. This makes our method fast enough for comparisons of moderate-size proteins (fewer than ∼800 residues) on current workstation-class computers and therefore addresses the need for a systematic analysis of multiple plausible shape similarities between two proteins using a widely accepted comparison metric.Availability: Seehttp://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/minrmsContact:tef@cgl.ucsf.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/625/239328/MINRMS-an-efficient-algorithm-for-determining	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg035	NULL	http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/minrms,http://tef@cgl.ucsf.edu	NULL	NULL

Most of these tests are formulatedin a frequentist framework, and it is not known how they compare with Bayesprocedures. I propose here two new Bayes tests that either compare pairs oftrees (Bayes hypothesis test, BHT), or test each tree against an average ofthe trees included in the analysis (Bayes significance test, BST).Results: The algorithm, based on a standard Metropolis–Hastingssampler, integrates nuisance parameters out and estimates the probability ofthe data under each topology. These quantities are used to estimate Bayesfactors for composite vs. composite hypotheses. Based on two data sets, theBHT and BST are shown to construct similar confidence sets to the bootstrapand the Shimodaira Hasegawa test, respectively.

The approach adds sequentially a new motif to amixture model by performing a combined scheme of global and local search forappropriately initializing its parameters. In addition, a hierarchicalpartitioning scheme based onkd-trees is presented for partitioning the input dataset in order to speed-up the global searching procedure. The proposed method compares favorably over the well-known MEMEapproach and treats successfully several drawbacks of MEME.Results: Experimental results indicate that the algorithm isadvantageous in identifying larger groups of motifscharacteristic of biological families with significant conservation.

protein sequences"	http://graziano.pesole@unimi.it	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	11	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	D. S. Horner,G. Pesole	NULL	Motivation: Maximum likelihood-based methods to estimate site by site substitution ratevariability in aligned homologous protein sequences rely on the formulationof a phylogenetic tree and generally assume that the patterns of relativevariability follow a pre-determined distribution. We present a phylogenetictree-independent method to estimate the relative variability of individualsites within large datasets of homologous protein sequences. It is basedupon two simple assumptions. Firstly that substitutions observed between twoclosely related sequences are likely, in general, to occur at the mostvariable sites. Secondly that non-conservative amino acid substitutions tendto occur at more variable sites. Our methodology makes no assumptionsregarding the underlying pattern of relative variability between sites.Results: We have compared, using data simulated under a non-gamma distributed model,the performance of this approach to that of a maximum likelihood method thatassumes gamma distributed rates. At low mean rates of evolution our methodinferred site by site relative substitution rates more accurately than themaximum likelihood approach in the absence of prior assumptions about therelationships between sequences. Our method does not directly account forthe effects of mutational saturation, However, we have incorporated an ‘ ad-hoc’ modification that allows the accurate estimation of relative sitevariability in fast evolving and saturated datasets.Availability: A script which implements the methodology described in this paper (writtenin Biopython) is available from dsh on request.Contact:graziano.pesole@unimi.it*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/600/239941/The-estimation-of-relative-site-variability-among	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg063	NULL	http://graziano.pesole@unimi.it	NULL	NULL

151	The fuzzy polynucleotide space: basic properties	http://amnieto@usc.es	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	21	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Angela Torres,Juan J. Nieto	NULL	Motivation: Any triplet codon may be regarded as a 12-dimensional fuzzy code. Sufficient information about a particular sequence may not be available in certain situations. The investigator will be confronted with imprecise sequences, yet want to make comparisons of sequences. Fuzzy polynucleotides can be compared by using geometrical interpretation of fuzzy sets as points in a hypercube.Results: We introduce the space of fuzzy polynucleotides and a means of measuring dissimilitudes between them. We establish mathematical principles to measure dissimilarities between fuzzy polynucleotides and present several examples in this metric space.We calculate the frequencies of the nucleotides at the three base sites of a codon in the coding sequences ofEscherichia coli K-12andMycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and consider them as points in that fuzzy space.

Presting	NULL	Motivation: Insertion mutagenesis, using transgenes or endogenoustransposons, is a popular method for generating null mutations (knockouts)in model organisms. Insertions are mapped to specific genes by amplifying(via TAIL-PCR) and sequencing genomic regions flanking the inserted DNA. Thepresence of multiple TAIL-PCR templates in one sequencing reaction resultsin chimeric sequence of intermittently low quality. Standard processing ofthis sequence by applying Phred quality requirements results in loss ofinformative sequence, whereas not trimming low-quality sequence causesinclusion of low-complexity homopolymers from the ends of sequence runs.Accurate mapping of the flanking sequences is complicated by the presence ofgene families.Results: Methods for extracting informative regions from sequencetraces obtained by sequencing multiple TAIL-PCR fragments in a singlereaction are described. The completely sequencedArabidopsisgenome was usedto identify informative TAIL-PCR sequence regions. Methods were devised todefine and select high quality matches and precisely map each insert to thecorrect genome location. These methods were used to analyze sequence ofTAIL-PCR-amplified flanking regions of the inserts from individual plants ina T-DNA-mutagenized population ofArabidopsis thaliana, and are applicable to similar situations where a reference genome can be used to extract information frompoor-quality sequence.Contact:gernot@genome.clemson.eduSupplementary information: Tables of the calculated T-DNA insertionsites and supplementary data are available athttp://www.tmri.org/pages/collaborations/garlic_files/Bioinfo.html*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/579/239684/Mapping-multiple-co-sequenced-T-DNA-integration	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg049	NULL	http://gernot@genome.clemson.edu,http://www.tmri.org/pages/collaborations/garlic_files/Bioinfo.html	NULL	NULL

using gene expression data"	http://www-lmc.imag.fr/SMS/software/microarrays/,http://anestis.antoniadis@imag.fr	ORIGINAL PAPER	60	87	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	A. Antoniadis,S. Lambert-Lacroix,F. Leblanc	NULL	Motivation: One particular application of microarray data, is to uncover the molecularvariation among cancers. One feature of microarray studies is the fact that the numbernof samples collected isrelatively small compared to the numberpof genes per sample which are usually in the thousands. In statistical terms this very large number of predictors compared to a small number of samples or observations makes the classification problem difficult. An efficient way to solve this problem is by using dimension reduction statistical techniques in conjunction with nonparametric discriminant procedures.Results: We view the classification problem as a regression problem with few observations and many predictor variables. We use an adaptive dimension reduction method for generalized semi-parametric regression models that allows us to solve the‘ curse of dimensionality problem’ arising in the context of expression data. The predictive performance of the resultingclassification rule is illustrated on two well know data sets in the microarray literature: the leukemia data that is known to contain classes that are easy ‘separable’ and the colon data set.Availability: Software that implements the procedures on which this paper focus are freely available athttp://www-lmc.imag.fr/SMS/software/microarrays/Contact:anestis.antoniadis@imag.fr*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/563/239920/Effective-dimension-reduction-methods-for-tumor	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg062	NULL	http://www-lmc.imag.fr/SMS/software/microarrays/,http://anestis.antoniadis@imag.fr	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL
154	Automatic analysis of DNA microarray images using mathematical morphology	http://angulo,serra@cmm.ensmp.fr,http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~angulo/	ORIGINAL PAPER	30	91	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jesús Angulo,Jean Serra	NULL	Motivation: DNA microarrays are an experimental technology which consists in arrays of thousands of discrete DNA sequences that are printed on glass microscope slides. Image analysis is an important aspect of microarray experiments. The aim of this step is to reduce an image of spots into a table with a measure of the intensity for each spot. Efficient, accurate and automatic analysis ofDNA spot images is essential in order to use this technology in laboratory routines.Results: We present an automatic non-supervised set of algorithms for a fast and accurate spot data extraction from DNA microarrays using morphological operators which are robust to both intensity variation and artefacts. The approach can be summarised as follows. Initially, a gridding algorithm yields the automatic segmentation of the microarray image into spot quadrants which are later individually analysed. Then the analysis of the spot quadrant images is achieved in five steps. First, a pre-quantification, the spot size distribution law is calculated. Second, the background noise extraction is performed using a morphological filtering by area. Third, an orthogonal grid provides the first approach to the spot locus. Fourth, the spot segmentation or spot boundaries definition is carried out using the watershed transformation. And fifth, the outline of detected spots allows the signal quantification or spot intensities extraction; in this respect, a noise model has been investigated. The performance of the algorithm has been compared with two packages: ScanAlyze and Genepix, showing its robustness and precision.Availability: A prototype system integrated in PDI32 (an image processing software for Windows) may be obtained from the authors on request.Contact:angulo,serra@cmm.ensmp.frSupplementary Information:http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~angulo/*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/553/239848/Automatic-analysis-of-DNA-microarray-images-using	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg057	NULL	http://angulo,serra@cmm.ensmp.fr,http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~angulo/	NULL	NULL

Madgula,Ranjan George,Rakesh K. Mishra,Madhusudhan W. Pandit,Chanderashekar S. Kumar,Lalji Singh	NULL	Motivation: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellite repeats are found abundantlyin many prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Among SSRs, tripletrepeats are of special significance because some of them have been linked tovarious genetic disorders. The objective of the study is to analyze thetriplet repeats of complete human genome and to identify the genes thatcontain the triplet repeats in their coding region. The analysis will helpus to identify the candidate genes that have potential for repeat expansion.Results: We have analyzed triplet repeats in the complete human genome from thepublicly available sequences. Our analysis revealed that AGC and CCGrepeat were predominantly present in the coding regions of the genome whileUTRs and the upstream sequences contained CCG repeats in relative abundance.Analysis of density of triplet repeats (bp/Mb) revealed that AAT and AACwere the abundant repeats whereas ACT and ACG were the rare repeats foundin human genome. We could identify about 2135 known or predicted genes thatwere associated with at least one of the triplet repeat types. A largeproportion of putative transcripts that were identified by gene findingprograms were found to be associated with triplet repeats. These transcriptswill be the candidate genes for analysis of triplet repeat expansion and apossible association with disease phenotypes. Identification of 171 geneswhich contain a minimum of ten repeat units will be of particular interestin future in correlating their association with any disease phenotype due tothe expansion potential of repeats present in them.

Two techniques are introduced specifically to tackle these problems: a feature selection method for unbalanced data and a classifier which adapts to the distribution of the the unlabeled test data (a so-called transductive method). We show both techniques improve identification performance and in conjunction provide an improvement over using only one of the techniques. Our results suggest the importance of taking into account the characteristics in this data which may also be relevant in other problems of a similar type.Availability: Matlab source code is available athttp://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/weston/kdd/kdd.htmlContact:jason.weston@tuebingen.mpg.deSupplementary information: Supplementary material is available athttp://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/weston/kdd/kdd.html.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-04-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182328400012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/6/764/234339/Feature-selection-and-transduction-for-prediction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg054	NULL	http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/weston/kdd/kdd.html,http://jason.weston@tuebingen.mpg.de,http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/weston/kdd/kdd.html	NULL	NULL

However, experimental data on protein interactionscontain many false positives, making these discoveries difficult. Thereforecomputational methods of assessing the reliability of each candidateprotein–protein interaction are urgently needed.Results: We developed a new ‘interaction generality’ measure (IG2)to assess the reliability of protein–protein interactions using only thetopological properties of their interaction-network structure. Using yeastprotein–protein interaction data, we showed that reliable protein–proteininteractions had significantly lower IG2 values than less-reliableinteractions, suggesting that IG2 values can be used to evaluate and filterinteraction data to enable the construction of reliable protein–protein interactionnetworks.Availability: The protein–protein interaction data used in thisstudy along with the associated IG2 values are available athttp://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp.Contact:rgscerg@gsc.riken.go.jp*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†Present address: Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, 14-1 Baba-cho, Tsuruoka, Yamagata997-0035, Japan.	2003-04-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182328400011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/6/756/234485/Construction-of-reliable-protein-protein	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg070	NULL	http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp,http://rgscerg@gsc.riken.go.jp	NULL	NULL

Tillier,Thomas W.H. Lui	NULL	Motivation: Multiple sequence alignments of homologousproteins are useful for inferring their phylogenetic history and to revealfunctionally important regions in the proteins. Functional constraints maylead to co-variation of two or more amino acids in the sequence, such that asubstitution at one site is accompanied by compensatory substitutions atanother site. It is not sufficient to find the statistical correlationsbetween sites in the alignment because these may be the result of severalundetermined causes. In particular, phylogenetic clustering will lead tomany strong correlations.Results: A procedure is developed to detect statisticalcorrelations stemming from functional interaction by removing the strongphylogenetic signal that leads to the correlations of each site with manyothers in the sequence. Our method relies upon the accuracy of the alignmentbut it does not require any assumptions about the phylogeny or thesubstitution process. The effectiveness of the method was verified usingcomputer simulations and then applied to predict functional interactionsbetween amino acids in the Pfam database of alignments.Availability: The program and supplementary figures tablesare available from the sitehttp://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/tillier/depend2/dependency.html.Contact:e.tillier@utoronto.ca*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-04-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182328400010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/6/750/234516/Using-multiple-interdependency-to-separate	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg072	NULL	http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/tillier/depend2/dependency.html,http://e.tillier@utoronto.ca	NULL	NULL
169	A segment alignment approach to protein comparison	http://ffas.ljcrf.edu/sea,http://ffas.ljcrf.edu/sea,http://adam@burnham.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	2	18	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yuzhen Ye,Lukasz Jaroszewski,Weizhong Li,Adam Godzik	NULL	Motivation: Local structure segments (LSSs) are small structuralunits shared by unrelated proteins. They are extensively used in proteinstructure comparison, and predicted LSSs (PLSSs) are used very successfullyinab initiofolding simulations. However, predicted or real LSSs are rarely exploited by protein sequence comparison programs that are based onposition-by-position alignments.Results: We developed a SEgment Alignment algorithm (SEA) tocompare proteins described as a collection of predicted local structuresegments (PLSSs), which is equivalent to an unweighted graph (network). Anyspecific structure, real or predicted corresponds to a specific path in this network. SEA then uses anetwork matching approach to find two most similar paths in networksrepresenting two proteins. SEA explores the uncertainty and diversity ofpredicted local structure information to search for a globally optimalsolution. It simultaneously solves two related problems: the alignment oftwo proteins and the local structure prediction for each of them. On abenchmark of protein pairs with low sequence similarity, we show thatapplication of the SEA algorithm improves alignment quality as compared toFFAS profile-profile alignment, and in some cases SEA alignments can matchthe structural alignments, a feat previously impossible for any sequencebased alignment methods.Availability: SEA is freely available for academic users on a webserverhttp://ffas.ljcrf.edu/sea.Supplementary information:http://ffas.ljcrf.edu/seaContact:adam@burnham.org*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.

Manyinteresting protein families have very little tertiary structuralinformation. Methods for deriving signatures using only primary andsecondary-structural information were therefore developed.Results: Two methods for deriving protein signatures using protein sequence information and predicted secondary structures are described. Onemethod is based on a scoring approach, the other on the Genetic Algorithm(GA). The effectiveness of the method was tested on the superfamily of GPCRsand compared with the established hidden Markov model (HMM) method. Thesignature method is shown to perform well, detecting 68% of superfamilymembers before the first false positive sequence and detecting severaldistant relationships.

In addition, a performanceevaluation of automated systems that attempt to tackle sequence analysesrapidly and reproducibly is generally missing. In order to quantify theaccuracy and reproducibility of function assignments on a genome-wide scale,we have re-annotated the entire genome sequence ofChlamydia trachomatis(serovar D), in acollaborative manner.Results: We have encoded all annotations in a structured format to allowfurther comparison and data exchange and have used a scale that records thedifferent levels of potential annotation errors according to theirpropensity to propagate in the database due to transitive functionassignments. We conclude that genome annotation may entail a considerableamount of errors, ranging from simple typographical errors to complexsequence analysis problems.

Since biological systems have many levels, it is important to focus on an appropriate level.In our first application of computer modeling to the early development of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, we focus on the cellular arrangementin early embryos. This plays a very important role in cell fate determination by cell–cell interaction, andis regarded as a system, one level higher than the system of gene regulation within cells. It is largely restricted by physicalconditions that seemed feasible to model by computer.Results: We constructed a computer model of theC.elegansembryo, currentlyup to the 4-cell stage, using a deformable and dividable triangulated network. The model is based solely on cellular-level dynamics. We found that the optimal ranges of three parameters that affect the elongation of dividing cells led,in computer simulations, to almost the same cellular arrangements as in real embryos.

Di Bello	NULL	Motivation: Microarray expression profilingappears particularly promising for a deeper understanding of cancer biology and to identify molecular signatures supporting the histological classification schemes of neoplastic specimens. However, molecular diagnostics based on microarray data presents major challenges due to the overwhelming number of variables and the complex, multiclass nature oftumor samples. Thus, the development of marker selection methods, that allow the identification of those genes that are most likely to confer high classification accuracy of multiple tumor types, and of multiclass classification schemes is of paramount importance.Results: Acomputational procedure for marker identification and forclassification of multiclass gene expression data through the application of disjoint principal component models is described. The identified features represent a rational and dimensionally reduced base forunderstanding the basic biologyof diseases, defining targetsfortherapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for the identification and classification of multiple pathological states. The method has been tested on different microarray data sets obtained from various human tumor samples. The results demonstrate that this procedure allows the identification of specific phenotype markers and can classifypreviously unseen instances in the presence of multiple classes.Availability: Matlab source codes are available from the authors.Contact:silvio.bicciato@unipd.itSupplementary information:http://www.dpci.unipd.it/PersPages/SBicciato/SIMCArray.html*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181964600004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/5/571/239746/PCA-disjoint-models-for-multiclass-cancer-analysis	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg051	NULL	http://silvio.bicciato@unipd.it,http://www.dpci.unipd.it/PersPages/SBicciato/SIMCArray.html	NULL	NULL

In time-course experiments in which gene expression is monitored over time, we are interested in testing gene expression profiles for different experimental groups. However, no sophisticated analytic methods have yet been proposedto handle time-course experiment data.Results: We propose a statistical test procedure based on the ANOVA model to identify genes that have different gene expression profiles among experimental groups in time-course experiments. Especially, we propose a permutation test which does not require the normality assumption. For this test, we use residuals from the ANOVA model only with time-effects. Using this test, we detect genes that have different gene expression profiles among experimental groups.

Grogan,Thomas P. Miller	NULL	Motivation: Large expression studies with clinical outcome data are becoming available for analysis. An important goal is to identify genes or clusters of genes where expression is related to patient outcome. While clustering methods are useful data exploration tools, they do not directly allow one to relate the expression data to clinical outcome. Alternatively, methods which rank genes based on their univariate significance do not incorporate gene function or relationships to genes that have been previously identified. In addition, after sifting through potentially thousands of genes, summary estimates (e.g. regression coefficients or error rates) algorithms should address the potentially large bias introduced by gene selection.Results: We developed a gene index technique that generalizes methods that rank genes by their univariate associations to patient outcome. Genes are ordered based on simultaneously linking their expression both to patient outcome and to a specific gene of interest. The technique can also be used to suggest profilesof gene expression related to patient outcome. A cross-validation method is shown to be important for reducing bias due to adaptive gene selection. The methods are illustrated on a recently collected gene expression data set based on 160 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL).Availability: A program written in the R language implementing the gene index can be obtained athttp://www.crab.org/papers/Contact:mikel@crab.org*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-04-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182328400003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/6/686/234608/Directed-indices-for-exploring-gene-expression	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg079	NULL	http://www.crab.org/papers/,http://mikel@crab.org	NULL	NULL

Mishra,Lalji Singh	NULL	Motivation: Bkm (Banded krait minor) satellite DNA sequences (GATA repeats) have beenshown to be associated with the sex determining chromosomes of variouseukaryotes and have been implicated in the evolution and differentiation ofsex chromosomes in snakes. The objective of the study is to analyze the GATArepeats of human genome specifically, the Y-chromosome, and other modelorganisms to understand the possible function and potential role in higherorder chromatin organization.Results: Our extensive analysis of GATA repeats in the prokaryotic and eukaryoticgenomes, which have been completely sequenced so far, has revealed that GATArepeats are absent in prokaryotes and have been gradually accumulated inhigher organisms during the course of evolution. In human, the Y-chromosomehas the highest GATA repeat density, which predominantly exists in the Yqcentromeric region. Generally, occurrence of repeats in the genomesdecreases steadily as the length of the repeat increases. In contrast, wereport, that the occurrence of GATA repeats increases as the length of therepeat increases from six tandem repeats onwards and peaks at (GATA)10–12. This has not been observed with any other simple repeat. Distributionof (GATA)10–12along the chromosome and their close proximity toMatrix Associated Regions (GATA-MAR) suggests that it may be demarkingchromatin domains for a coordinated expression of genes residing in thesedomains.

Jones	NULL	Motivation: In order to enhance genome annotation, the fully automatic fold recognition methodGenTHREADER has been improved and benchmarked. The previous version of GenTHREADER consisted of a simpleneural network whichwas trained to combine sequence alignment score, length information and energypotentials derived fromthreading into a single score representing the relationship between two proteins, asdesignated by CATH. Theimproved version incorporates PSI-BLAST searches, which have been jumpstarted withstructural alignmentprofiles from FSSP, and now also makes use of PSIPRED predicted secondary structure andbi-directionalscoring in order to calculate the final alignment score. Pairwise potentials and solvationpotentials arecalculated from the given sequence alignment which are then used as inputs to a multi-layer,feed-forwardneural network, along with the alignment score, alignment length and sequence length. Theneural network hasalso been expanded to accommodate the secondary structure element alignment (SSEA) scoreas an extra inputand it is now trained to learn the FSSPZ-score as a measurement of similarity between two proteins.Results: The improvements made to GenTHREADER increase the number of remote homologues that can bedetected with a low error rate, implying higher reliability of score, whilst also increasing the quality ofthe models produced. We find that up to five times as many true positives can be detected with low errorrate per query. Total MaxSub score is doubled at low false positive rates using the improved method.Availability:http://www.psipred.netContact:l.mcguffin@cs.ucl.ac.uk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182634800012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/7/874/197639/Improvement-of-the-GenTHREADER-method-for-genomic	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg097	NULL	http://www.psipred.net,http://l.mcguffin@cs.ucl.ac.uk	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Poole,Michael D. Hendy,David Penny,Vincent Moulton	NULL	Motivation: Noncoding RNA genes produce functional RNA molecules rather than coding for proteins. One such family is the H/ACA snoRNAs. Unlike the related C/D snoRNAs these have resistedautomated detection to date.Results: We develop an algorithm to screenthe yeast genome for novel H/ACA snoRNAs. To achieve this, we introduce some new methodsfor facilitating the search for noncodingRNAs in genomic sequences which are based on properties ofpredicted minimum free-energy (MFE) secondary structures. The algorithm has been implementedand can be generalized to enable screening ofother eukaryote genomes. We find that useof primary sequence alone is insufficient for identifyingnovel H/ACA snoRNAs. Only the use ofsecondary structure filters reduces thenumber of candidates to amanageable size. Fromgenomic context, we identify three strongH/ACA snoRNA candidates.

Tools allowing the visualization of results produced by analysis methods, superimposed on possibly annotated sequence data, and enabling synchronized navigation in multiple genomes, provide new means for interactive genome exploration.

Magwene,Paul Lizardi,Junhyong Kim	NULL	Motivation: Accurate time series for biological processes aredifficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization, temporal samplingand rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed that can utilizemulti-dimensional data, such as those resulting from DNA microarrayexperiments, in order to reconstruct time series from unordered or poorlyordered sets of observations.Results: We present a set of algorithms for estimating temporalorderings from unordered sets of sample elements. The techniques we describeare based on modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from aweighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach byapplying these techniques to an artificial data set as well as several geneexpression data sets derived from DNA microarray experiments. In addition toestimating orderings, the techniques we describe also provide usefulheuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample datasets such asnoise and sampling intensity, and we show how a data structure called aPQ-tree can be used to represent uncertainty in a reconstructed ordering.Availability: Academic implementations of the ordering algorithmsare available as source code (in the programming language Python) on our website, along with documentation on their use.

one-channel cDNA microarray studies"	http://DEd@novonordisk.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	54	97	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	David Edwards	NULL	Motivation: Data from one-channel cDNA microarray studies may exhibit poor reproducibility due to spatial heterogeneity, non-linear array-to-array variation and problems in correcting for background. Uncorrected, these phenomena can give rise to misleading conclusions.Results: Spatial heterogeneity may be corrected using two-dimensional loess smoothing (Colantuoniet al., 2002). Non-linear between-array variation may be corrected using an iterative application of one-dimensional loess smoothing. A method for background correction using a smoothing function rather than simple subtraction is described. These techniques promote within-array spatial uniformity and between-array reproducibility. Their application is illustrated using data from a study of the effects of an insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, on gene expression in white adipose tissue in diabetic db/db mice. They may also be useful with data from two-channel cDNA microarrays and from oligonucleotide arrays.Availability: R functions for the methods described are available on request from the author.Contact:DEd@novonordisk.com	2003-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182634800006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/7/825/197375/Non-linear-normalization-and-background-correction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg083	NULL	http://DEd@novonordisk.com	NULL	NULL

sample classes using gene expression profile"	http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu:8052/hgc/Downloads.asp,http://wujuli@yahoo.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	9	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Wuju Li,Ming Fan,Momiao Xiong	NULL	Motivation: Feature (gene) selection can dramatically improve theaccuracy of gene expression profile based sample class prediction. Manystatistical methods for feature (gene) selection such as stepwiseoptimization and Monte Carlo simulation have been developed for tissuesample classification. In contrast to class prediction, few statistical andcomputational methods for feature selection have been applied to clusteringalgorithms for pattern discovery.Results: An integrated scheme and corresponding program SamClusterfor automatic discovery of sample classes based on gene expression profile is presented in this report. The scheme incorporates the feature selectionalgorithms based on the calculation ofCV(coefficient of variation) andt-test into hierarchical clustering and proceeds as follows. At first, thegenes with theirCVgreater than the pre-specified threshold are selected for cluster analysis, which results in two putative sample classes. Then,significantly differentially expressed genes in the two putative sampleclasses withp-values ≤ 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 fromt-test areselected for further cluster analysis. The above processes were iterateduntil the two stable sample classes were found. Finally, the consensussample classes are constructed from the putative classes that are derivedfrom the differentCVthresholds, and the best putative sample classes thathave the minimum distance between the consensus classes and the putativeclasses are identified.

196	Statistical design of reverse dye microarrays	http://dobbinke@mail.nih.gov,http://linus.nci.nih.gov/~brb/TechReport.htm	ORIGINAL PAPER	3	70	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	K. Dobbin,J. H. Shih,R. Simon	NULL	Motivation: In cDNA microarray experiments all samples are labelled with either Cy3 dye or Cy5 dye.Certain genes exhibit dye bias—a tendency to bind more efficiently to one of the dyes.The common reference design avoids the problem of dye bias by running all arrays ‘forward’, so that the samples being compared are always labelled with the same dye.But comparison of samples labelled with different dyes is sometimes of interest. In these situations, it is necessary to run some arrays‘ reverse’—with the dye labelling reversed—in order to correct for the dye bias.The design of these experiments will impact one’s ability to identify genes that are differentially expressed in different tissues or conditions.We address the design issue of how many specimens are needed, how many forward and reverse labelled arrays to perform, and how to optimally assign Cy3 and Cy5 labels to the specimens.Results: We consider three types of experiments for which some reverse labelling is needed:paired samples, samples from two predefined groups, and reference design data when comparison with the reference is of interest.We present simple probability models for the data, derive optimal estimators for relative gene expression, and compare the efficiency of the estimators for a range of designs. In each case, we present the optimal design and sample size formulas.We show that reverse labelling of individual arrays is generally not required.Contact:dobbinke@mail.nih.gov.Supplementary information: Supplementary material referenced in the text is available athttp://linus.nci.nih.gov/~brb/TechReport.htm*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182634800003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/7/803/197279/Statistical-design-of-reverse-dye-microarrays	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg076	NULL	http://dobbinke@mail.nih.gov,http://linus.nci.nih.gov/~brb/TechReport.htm	NULL	NULL
197	Selection of oligonucleotide probes for protein coding sequences	http://seed@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/oligopicker/index.html	ORIGINAL PAPER	16	105	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Xiaowei Wang,Brian Seed	NULL	Motivation: Large arrays of oligonucleotide probes have becomepopular tools for analyzing RNA expression. However to date most oligocollections contain poorly validated sequences or are biased towarduntranslated regions (UTRs). Here we present a strategy for picking oligosfor microarrays that focus on a design universe consisting exclusively ofprotein coding regions. We describe the constraints in oligo design that areimposed by this strategy, as well as a software tool that allows thestrategy to be applied broadly.Results: In this work we sequentially apply a variety of simplefilters to candidate sequences for oligo probes. The primary filter is arejection of probes that contain contiguous identity with any other sequencein the sample universe that exceeds a pre-established threshold length. Wefind that rejection of oligos that contain 15 bases of perfect match withother sequences in the design universe is a feasible strategy for oligoselection for probe arrays designed to interrogate mammalian RNApopulations. Filters to remove sequences with low complexity and predictedpoor probe accessibility narrow the candidate probe space only slightly.Rejection based on global sequence alignment is performed as a secondary,rather than primary, test, leading to an algorithm that is computationallyefficient. Splice isoforms pose unique challenges and we find that isoformprevalence will for the most part have to be determined by analysis of thepatterns of hybridization of partially redundant oligonucleotides.Availability: The oligo design program OligoPicker and its sourcecode are freely available at our website.Contact:seed@molbio.mgh.harvard.eduSupplementary information:http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/oligopicker/index.html*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000182634800002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/7/796/197432/Selection-of-oligonucleotide-probes-for-protein	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg086	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Weckwerth	NULL	Motivation: Metabolite profiling aims at an unbiased identification and quantification of all the metabolites present in a biological sample.Based on their pair-wise correlations, the data obtained frommetabolomic experiments are organized into metabolic correlation networks and the key challenge is to deduce unknown pathways based onthe observed correlations. However, the data generated is fundamentally different from traditionalbiological measurements and thus theanalysis is often restricted to rather pragmatic approaches, such as datamining tools, to discriminate between different metabolic phenotypes.Methods and Results: We investigate to what extent the data generated networks reflectthe structure of the underlying biochemical pathways.The purpose of this work is 2-fold:Based on the theory of stochastic systems, we first introduce a framework which shows that the emergent correlationscan be interpreted as a‘ fingerprint’ of the underlying biophysical system. This result leads to a systematic relationship between observedcorrelation networks and the underlying biochemical pathways.In a second step, we investigate to what extent our result is applicable to the problem of reverse engineering, i.e. to recover the underlying enzymatic reaction network from data.

However, how can a consensus be constructed when its inherentassumption—that the aligned sequences form a single linear consensus—isnot true?Results: Partial Order Alignment (POA) enables construction and analysis ofmultiple sequence alignments as directed acyclic graphs containing complexbranching structure. Here we present a dynamic programming algorithm(heaviest_bundle) for generating multiple consensus sequences from such complex alignments.The number and relationships of these consensus sequences reveals the degreeof structural complexity of the source alignment. This is a powerful andgeneral approach for analyzing and visualizing complex alignment structures,and can be applied to any alignment. We illustrate its value for analyzingexpressed sequence alignments to detect alternative splicing, reconstructfull length mRNA isoform sequences from EST fragments, and separate paralogmixtures that can cause incorrect SNP predictions.Availability: Theheaviest_bundlesource code is available athttp://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poaContact:leec@mbi.ucla.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/999/235258/Generating-consensus-sequences-from-partial-order	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg109	NULL	http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa,http://leec@mbi.ucla.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL

For steric reasons it is reasonable to assume that not all combinations of codons and therefore of tRNAs are equally favorable when situated on the ribosome surface. Aiming of identifying preferential and rare codon pairs, we have determined the frequency of occurrence of all possible combinations of codon pairs in the entire genome ofEscherichia coli(E.coli).Results: The frequency of occurrence of the 3904 codon pairs comprising both sense:sense and sense:stop codon pairs in the full set ofE.coli4289 ORFs was found to vary from zero to 4913 times. For most of the pairs we have observed a significant difference between the real and statistically predicted frequency of occurrence. The analysis of 334 highly expressed and 303 poorly expressedE.coligenes showed that codon pair usage is different for the two gene categories. Using an especially defined criterion (Δreg), the codon pairs are classified as ‘hypothetically attenuating’ (HAP) and ‘hypothetically non-attenuating’ (HNAP) and their possible effect on translation is discussed.Availability: The program used in this study is available athttp://www.bio21.bas.bg/codonpairs/Contact:iviv@obzor.bio21.bas.bg;svetlana@obzor.bio21.bas.bg*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/987/235156/Codon-pairs-in-the-genome-of-Escherichia-coli	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg082	NULL	http://www.bio21.bas.bg/codonpairs/,http://iviv@obzor.bio21.bas.bg,http://svetlana@obzor.bio21.bas.bg	NULL	NULL

210	Fuzzy C-means method for clustering microarray data	http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/fcm/,http://doulaye@titus.u-strasbg.fr	ORIGINAL PAPER	107	241	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Doulaye Dembélé,Philippe Kastner	NULL	Motivation: Clustering analysis of data from DNA microarray hybridization studies is essential for identifying biologically relevant groups of genes.Partitional clustering methods such as K-means or self-organizing mapsassign each gene to a single cluster. However, these methods do not provide information about the influence of a given gene for the overall shape of clusters. Here we apply a fuzzy partitioning method, Fuzzy C-means (FCM), to attribute cluster membership values to genes.Results: A major problem in applying the FCM method for clustering microarray data is the choice of the fuzziness parameterm. We show that the commonly used valuem= 2 is not appropriate for some data sets, and that optimal values formvary widely from one data set to another. We propose an empirical method, based on the distribution of distances between genes in a given data set, to determine an adequate value form. By setting threshold levels for the membership values, genes which are tigthly associated to a given cluster can be selected.Using a yeast cell cycle data set as an example, we show that this selection increases the overall biological significance of the genes within the cluster.Availability: Supplementary text and Matlab functions are available athttp://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/fcm/Contact:doulaye@titus.u-strasbg.fr*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/973/235328/Fuzzy-C-means-method-for-clustering-microarray	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg119	NULL	http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/fcm/,http://doulaye@titus.u-strasbg.fr	NULL	NULL

transformations for gene-expression microarray data"	http://dmrocke@ucdavis.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	44	88	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	David M. Rocke,Blythe Durbin	NULL	Motivation: A variance stabilizing transformation for microarray data was recently introduced independently by several research groups. This transformation has sometimes been called the generalized logarithm or glog transformation. In this paper, we derive several alternative approximate variance stabilizing transformations that may be easier to use in some applications.Results: We demonstrate that the started-log and the log-linear-hybrid transformation families can produce approximate variance stabilizing transformations for microarray data that are nearly as good as the generalized logarithm (glog) transformation. These transformations may be more convenient in some applications.Contact:dmrocke@ucdavis.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/966/235230/Approximate-variance-stabilizing-transformations	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg107	NULL	http://dmrocke@ucdavis.edu	NULL	NULL

Stoughton	NULL	Motivation:There is a very large and growing level of efforttoward improving the platforms, experiment designs, and data analysismethods for microarray expression profiling. Along with a growing richnessin the approaches there is a growing confusion among most scientists as tohow to make objective comparisons and choices between them for differentapplications. There is a need for a standard framework for the microarraycommunity to compare and improve analytical and statistical methods.Results: We report on a microarray data set comprising 204in-situsynthesized oligonucleotide arrays, each hybridized with two-color cDNAsamples derived from 20 different human tissues and cell lines. Design ofthe ∼ 24 000 60mer oligonucleotides that report ∼2500 known genes on the arrays, and design of the hybridization experiments, werecarried out in a way that supports the performance assessment of alternativedata processing approaches and of alternative experiment and array designs.We also propose standard figures of merit for success in detectingindividual differential expression changes or expression levels, and fordetecting similarities and differences in expression patterns across genesand experiments. We expect this data set and the proposed figures of meritwill provide a standard framework for much of the microarray community tocompare and improve many analytical and statistical methods relevant tomicroarray data analysis, including image processing, normalization, errormodeling, combining of multiple reporters per gene, use of replicateexperiments, and sample referencing schemes in measurements based onexpression change.Availability/Supplementary information:Expression data andsupplementary information are available athttp://www.rii.com/publications/2003/HE_SDS.htmContact:yudong_he@merck.com*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†A wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/956/235419/Microarray-standard-data-set-and-figures-of-merit	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg126	NULL	http://www.rii.com/publications/2003/HE_SDS.htm,http://yudong_he@merck.com	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL

Yang,Ying Hu,Michael Edmonson,Kenneth Buetow,Maxwell P. Lee	NULL	Motivation: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in both normal development and diseases. Abnormal imprinting is strongly associatedwith several human diseases including cancers. Most of the imprinted geneswere discovered in the neighborhood of the known imprinted genes. Thisapproach is difficult to extend to analyze the whole genome. We have decidedto take a computational approach to systematically search the whole genomefor the presence of mono-allelic expressed genes and imprinted genes inhuman genome.Results: A computational method was developed to identify novel imprinted or mono-allelic genes. Individuals represented in human cDNAlibraries were genotyped using Bayesian statistics, and differentialexpression of polymorphic alleles was identified. A significant reduction inthe number of libraries that expressed both alleles, measured byZ-statistics, is a strong indicator for an imprinted or a mono-allelic gene.Availability: The data sets are available athttp://leelab.nci.nih.gov/leelab/jsp/IGDM/IGDM.htmlContact:leemax@mail.nih.gov.Supplementary information:http://leelab.nci.nih.gov/leelab/jsp/IGDM/IGDM.html*To whom correspondence should be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/952/235435/Computation-method-to-identify-differential	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg127	NULL	http://leelab.nci.nih.gov/leelab/jsp/IGDM/IGDM.html,http://leemax@mail.nih.gov.,http://leelab.nci.nih.gov/leelab/jsp/IGDM/IGDM.html	NULL	NULL

Dougherty	NULL	Motivation:A major problem of pattern classification is estimation of the Bayes error when only small samples are available. One way to estimate the Bayes error is to design a classifier based on some classification rule applied to sample data, estimate the error of the designed classifier, and then use this estimate as an estimate of the Bayes error. Relative to the Bayes error, the expected error of the designed classifier is biased high, and this bias can be severe with small samples.Results: This paper provides a correction for the bias by subtracting a term derived from the representation of the estimation error. It does so for Boolean classifiers, these being defined on binary features. Although the general theory applies to any Boolean classifier, a model is introduced to reduce the number of parameters. A key point is that the expected correction is conservative. Properties of the corrected estimate are studied via simulation. The correction applies to binary predictors because they are mathematically identical to Boolean classifiers. In this context the correction is adapted to the coefficient of determination, which has been used to measure nonlinear multivariate relations between genes and design genetic regulatory networks.

Although the knowledge is organizedaround sets of domain-specific terms, few literature mining systemsincorporate deep and dynamic terminology processing.Results: In this paper, we present an overview of an integratedframework for terminology-driven mining from biomedical literature. Theframework integrates the following components: automatic term recognition,term variation handling, acronym acquisition, automatic discovery of termsimilarities and term clustering. The term variant recognition isincorporated into terminology recognition process by taking into accountorthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic and pragmatic termvariations. In particular, we address acronyms as a common way ofintroducing term variants in biomedical papers. Term clustering is based onthe automatic discovery of term similarities. We use a hybrid similaritymeasure, where terms are compared by using both internal and externalevidence. The measure combines lexical, syntactical and contextualsimilarity.

Such datacan be erroneous and they often do not provide adequate functionalinformation for the detected interactions. Therefore, it is useful todevelop anin silicoapproach to further validate and annotate the detected proteininteractions.Results: Given that protein–protein interactions involve physicalinteractions between protein domains, domain–domain interaction informationcan be useful for validating, annotating, and even predicting proteininteractions. However, large-scale, experimentally determined domain–domaininteraction data do not exist. Here, we describe an integrative approach tocomputationally derive putative domain interactions from multiple datasources, including protein interactions, protein complexes, and RosettaStone sequences.

Tools that have been based on Java 3D™are compatible among different systems and they can be run remotely through web browsers. However, using Java 3D for visualization has some performance issues with it. The primary concerns about molecular visualization tools based on Java 3D are in their being slow in terms of interaction speed and in their inability to load large molecules. This behavior is especially apparent when the number of atoms to be displayed is huge, or when several proteins are to be displayed simultaneously for comparison.Results: In this paper we present techniques for organizing a Java 3D scene graph to tackle these problems. We have developed a protein visualization system based on Java 3D and these techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the visualization component of our system with two other Java 3D based molecular visualization tools. In particular, for van der Waals display mode, with the efficient organization of the scene graph, we could achieve up to eight times improvement in rendering speed and could load molecules three times as large as the previous systems could.Availability: FPV is freely available with source code at the following URL:http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~tcan/fpv/Contact:tcan@cs.ucsb.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-05-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183095300002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/8/913/235182/FPV-fast-protein-visualization-using-Java-3DTM	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg104	NULL	http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~tcan/fpv/,http://tcan@cs.ucsb.edu	NULL	NULL

Donoghue	NULL	Motivation: A noble and ultimate objective of phyloinformaticresearch is to assemble, synthesize, and explore the evolutionary history of life on earth. Data mining methods for performing these tasks are not yetwell developed, but one avenue of research suggests that networkconnectivity dynamics will play an important role in future methods.Analysis of disordered networks, such as small-world networks, hasapplications as diverse as disease propagation, collaborative networks, andpower grids. Here we apply similar analyses to networks of phylogenetictrees in order to understand how synthetic information can emerge from adatabase of phylogeniesResults: Analyses of tree network connectivity in TreeBASE showthat a collection of phylogenetic trees behaves as a small-world network—while on the one hand the trees are clustered, like a non-random lattice, onthe other hand they have short characteristic path lengths, like a randomgraph. Tree connectivities follow a dual-scale power-law distribution (first power-law exponent ≈1.87; second ≈4.82). This unusualpattern is due, in part, to the presence of alternative tree topologies thatenter the database with each published study. As expected, small collectionsof trees decrease connectivity as new trees are added, while largecollections of trees increase connectivity. However, the inflection point issurprisingly low: after about 600 trees the network suddenly jumps to ahigher level of coherence. More stringent definitions of ‘neighbour’ greatlydelay the threshold whence a database achieves sufficient maturity for acoherent network to emerge. However, more stringent definitions of‘neighbour’ would also likely show improved focus in data miningAvailability:http://treebase.orgContact:wpiel@buffalo.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†Current address: Department of Biological Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA	2003-06-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183528300017&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/9/1162/285008/The-small-world-dynamics-of-tree-networks-and-data	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg131	NULL	http://treebase.org,http://wpiel@buffalo.edu	NULL	NULL

structure from associations of gene expression measurements with
microarrays"	http://tchu@andrew.cmu.edu	MICROARRAY WORKSHOP PAPER	5	22	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Tianjiao Chu,Clark Glymour,Richard Scheines,Peter Spirtes	NULL	Motivation: One approach to inferring genetic regulatory structure from microarray measurements of mRNA transcript hybridization is to estimate the associations of gene expression levels measured in repeated samples. The associations may be estimated by correlation coefficients or by conditional frequencies (for discretized measurements) or by some other statistic. Although these procedures have been successfully applied to other areas, their validity when applied tomicroarray measurements has yet to be testedResults: This paper describes an elementary statistical difficulty for all such procedures, no matter whether based on Bayesian updating, conditional independence testing, or other machine learning procedures such as simulated annealing or neural net pruning. The difficulty obtains if a number of cells from a common population are aggregated in a measurement of expression levels. Although there are special cases where the conditional associations are preserved under aggregation, in general inference of genetic regulatory structure based on conditional association is unwarrantedContact:tchu@andrew.cmu.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-06-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183528300014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/9/1147/284971/A-statistical-problem-for-inference-to-regulatory	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg011	NULL	http://tchu@andrew.cmu.edu	NULL	NULL

Marsh,Prasad S. Dhurjati	NULL	Motivation: Experimental gene expression data sets, such as thosegenerated by microarray or gene chip experiments, typically have significantnoise and complicated interconnectivities that make understanding evensimple regulatory patterns difficult. Given these complications,characterizing the effectiveness of different analysis techniques to uncovernetwork groups and structures remains a challenge. Generating simulatedexpression patterns with known biological features of expression complexity,diversity and interconnectivities provides a more controlled means ofinvestigating the appropriateness of different analysis methods. Asimulation-based approach can systematically evaluate different geneexpression analysis techniques and provide a basis for improved methods indynamic metabolic network reconstructionResults: We have developed an on-line simulator, called eXPatGen,to generate dynamic gene expression patterns typical of microarrayexperiments. eXPatGen provides a quantitative network structure to representkey biological features, including the induction, repression, and cascaderegulation of messenger RNA (mRNA). The simulation is modular such that theexpression model can be replaced with other representations, depending onthe level of biological detail required by the user. Two example genenetworks, of 25 and 100 genes respectively, were simulated. Two standardanalysis techniques, clustering and PCA analysis, were performed on theresulting expression patterns in order to demonstrate how the simulatormight be used to evaluate different analysis methods and provideexperimental guidance for biological studies of gene expressionAvailability:http://www.che.udel.edu/eXPatGen/Contact:dhurjati@che.udel.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-06-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183528300013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/9/1140/285013/eXPatGen-generating-dynamic-expression-patterns	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg132	NULL	http://www.che.udel.edu/eXPatGen/,http://dhurjati@che.udel.edu	NULL	NULL

This new approachpromises to give better therapeutic measurements to cancer patients by diagnosing cancer types with improved accuracy. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of theclassification methods successfully applied to the cancer diagnosis problems. However, its optimal extension to more than two classes wasnot obvious, which might impose limitations in its application to multipletumor types. We briefly introduce the Multicategory SVM, which is arecently proposed extension of the binary SVM, and apply it to multiclass cancer diagnosis problemsResults: Its applicability is demonstrated on the leukemia data(Golubet al., 1999) and the small round blue cell tumors of childhooddata (Khanet al., 2001).

Its first stage involves compression of dimensions that can be achieved by applying SVD to the gene–sample matrix in microarray problems. Thus the data (samples or genes) can be represented by vectors in a truncated space of low dimensionality, 4 and 5 in the examples studied here. We find it preferable to project all vectors onto the unit sphere before applying a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm used here is the quantum clustering method that has one free scale parameter. Although the method is not hierarchical, it can be modified to allow hierarchy in terms of this scale parameterResults: We apply our method to three data sets. The results are very promising. On cancer cell data we obtain a dendrogram that reflects correct groupings of cells. In an AML/ALL data set we obtain very good clustering of samples into four classes of the data. Finally, in clustering of genes in yeast cell cycle data we obtain four groups in a problem that is estimated to contain five familiesAvailability: Software is available as Matlab programs athttp://neuron.tau.ac.il/~horn/QC.htmContact:horn@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-06-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183528300009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/9/1110/284988/Novel-clustering-algorithm-for-microarray	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg053	NULL	http://neuron.tau.ac.il/~horn/QC.htm,http://horn@post.tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL
230	Simultaneous gene clustering and subset selection for sample classification via MDL	http://rebecka@stat.rutgers.edu	MICROARRAY WORKSHOP PAPER	21	43	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Rebecka Jörnsten,Bin Yu	NULL	Motivation: The microarray technology allows for the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes for each sample.The high-dimensional gene expression data can be used to study similarities of gene expression profiles across different samples to form a gene clustering. The clusters may be indicative of genetic pathways.Parallel to gene clustering is the important application of sample classification based on all or selected gene expressions. The gene clustering and sample classification are often undertaken separately, or in a directional manner (one as anaid for the other). However, such separation of these two tasks may occlude informative structure in the data. Here we present an algorithm for the simultaneous clustering of genes and subset selection of gene clusters for sample classification. We develop a new model selection criterion based on Rissanen’s MDL (minimum description length) principle.For the first time, anMDL code length is given for both explanatory variables (genes) and response variables (sample class labels). The final output of the proposed algorithm is a sparse and interpretable classification rule based on cluster centroids or the closest genes to the centroidsResults: Our algorithm for simultaneous gene clustering and subsetselection for classification is applied to three publicly available datasets. For all three data sets, we obtain sparse and interpretable classification models based on centroids of clusters. At the same time, these models givecompetitive test error rates as the best reported methods. Compared withclassification models based on single gene selections, our rules are stablein the sense that the number of clusters has a small variability and thecentroids of the clusters are well correlated (or consistent) across different cross validation samples. We also discuss models where thecentroids of clusters are replaced with the genes closest to the centroids.These models show comparable test error rates to models based on single geneselection, but are more sparse as well as more stable.Moreover, we comment on how the inclusion of a classification criterionaffects the gene clustering, bringing out class informative structure in thedataAvailability: The methods presented in this paper have been implemented in the R language.

An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples.Results: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observationsContact:sandrine@stat.berkeley.eduSupplementary information: For supplementary information on datasets, analyses, and software, consulthttp://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sandrineandhttp://www.bioconductor.org.*To whom correspondence should be addressed.The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, both authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.	2003-06-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000183528300007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/9/1090/284978/Bagging-to-improve-the-accuracy-of-a-clustering	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg038	NULL	http://sandrine@stat.berkeley.edu,http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sandrine,http://www.bioconductor.org	NULL	NULL

Gifford,Nathan Srebro,Angèle M. Hamel,Tommi S. Jaakkola	NULL	Motivation: A major challenge in gene expression analysis is effective dataorganization and visualization. One of the most popular tools for this task is hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clusteringallows a user to view relationships in scales ranging from single genes tolarge sets of genes, while at the same time providing a global viewof the expression data. However, hierarchical clusteringis very sensitive to noise, it usually lacks of a method to actuallyidentify distinct clusters, and produces a large number of possible leaforderings of the hierarchical clustering tree. In this paper we propose a new hierarchical clusteringalgorithm which reduces susceptibility to noise, permits uptoksiblings to be directly related, and provides a single optimal order for the resulting treeResults: We present an algorithm that efficiently constructs ak-ary tree,where each node can have up tokchildren, and then optimally orders the leaves of that tree.By combiningkclusters at each step our algorithm becomes more robust against noise and missing values.By optimally ordering the leaves of the resulting tree we maintain thepairwise relationships that appear in the original method, withoutsacrificing the robustness.Ourk-ary construction algorithm runs inO(n3) regardless ofkand our ordering algorithm runs inO(4kn3).

This reduces the quality of gene expression data, because it seriously violates the linearity of expression with respect to signal intensity. Statistical methods based on typically available spot summaries together with some parametric assumptions can suggest ways to correct for this defectResults: A maximum likelihood approach is suggested together with a sensible approximation to the joint density of the mean, median and variance—which are typically available to the biological end-user. The method ‘corrects’ the gene expression values for pixel censoring. A by-product of our approach is a comparison between several two-parameter models for pixel intensity values.

As alternatives, a class of three nonparametric statistical methods, including the empirical Bayes method of Efronet al.(2001), the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method of Tusheret al.(2001) and the mixture model method (MMM) of Panet al.(2001), have been proposed. All the three methods depend on constructing a test statistic and a so-called null statistic such that the null statistic’s distribution can be used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. However, relatively little effort has been directed toward assessment of the performance or the underlying assumptions of the methods in constructing such test and null statisticsResults: We point out a problem of a current method to construct the test and null statistics, which may lead to largely inflated Type I errors (i.e. false positives). We also propose two modifications that overcome the problem. In the context of MMM, the improved performance of the modified methods is demonstrated using simulated data.

We have created a robust software system that runs algorithms previously described on DNA sequences and provides a public web interface to the system for use by the biological community worldwide.The GeneComber system performsab initiogene prediction by first taking a user inputted DNA sequence and running Genscan and HMMgene.The outputs of Genscan and HMMgene are then integrated using the EUI, GI and EUI_frame algorithms.All results are then stored into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and can then be retrieved through a web interface.The web interface provides a unified view of the GeneComber predictions by graphically overlaying outputs from Genscan, HMMgene, EUI, GI and EUI_frame.Outputs can also be retrieved in general feature format (GFF) or FASTA format.The software is written in the Perl programming language and is both dependent on and interoperable with the Bioperl toolkit.It includes high-level application programming interfaces (APIs) to run Genscan, HMMgene and a database API to insert prediction results into an RDBMS.The APIs are assembled into thegenecomberscript which is executed by the web interface or can be run directly from the Unix command line.The web interface is written in PHP and is structured so as to be easily modified for viewing data from any database that stores gene structures.Availability: The GeneComber public web interface and supplementary information is located athttp://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/genecomberThe source code is released under the GNU General Public License and is available atftp://ftp.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/pub/genecomber/softwareContact:francis@bioinformatics.ubc.ca*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†Present address: EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute,Cambridge CB10 1SD, UK.	2003-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184145200019&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/10/1296/184327/GeneComber-combining-outputs-of-gene-prediction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg139	NULL	http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/genecomber,http://francis@bioinformatics.ubc.ca	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

243	"A comparison of parametric versus permutation
methods with applications to general and temporal
microarray gene expression data"	http://rxu@jimmy.harvard.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	3	23	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ronghui Xu,Xiaochun Li	NULL	Motivation: In analyses of microarray data with a design of different biological conditions, ranking genes by their differential‘ importance’ is often desired so that biologists can focus research on a small subset of genes that are most likely related to the experiment conditions. Permutation methods areoften recommended and used, in place of their parametric counterparts, due tothe small sample sizes of microarray experimentsand possible non-normality of the data. The recommendations,however, are based on classical knowledge in the hypothesis test setting.Results: We explore the relationship between hypothesis testing and gene ranking. We indicate that the permutation method does notprovide a metric for the distance between two underlying distributions. In our simulation studies permutation methods tend to be equally or less accurate than parametric methods in ranking genes. This is partially due to the discreteness of the permutation distributions, as well as the non-metric property. In data analysisthe variability in ranking genes can be assessed by bootstrap. It turnsout that the variability is much lower for permutation than parametricmethods, which agrees with the known robustness of permutationmethods to individual outliers in the data.Contact:rxu@jimmy.harvard.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184145200015&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/10/1284/184531/A-comparison-of-parametric-versus-permutation	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg155	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL
244	"Investigating semantic similarity measures

sequence and annotation"	http://www.russet.org.uk,http://p.lord@russet.org.uk	ORIGINAL PAPER	181	420	4	Bioinformatics Oxford	P. W. Lord,R. D. Stevens,A. Brass,C. A. Goble	NULL	Motivation: Many bioinformatics data resources not only hold data in the form of sequences, but also as annotation. In the majority of cases, annotation is written as scientific natural language: this is suitable for humans, but not particularly useful for machine processing. Ontologies offer a mechanism by which knowledge can be represented in a form capable of such processing. In this paper we investigate the use of ontological annotation to measure the similarities in knowledge content or‘ semantic similarity’ between entries in a data resource. These allow a bioinformatician to perform a similarity measure over annotation in an analogous manner to those performed over sequences.A measure of semantic similarity for the knowledge component of bioinformatics resources should afford a biologist a new tool in their repetoire of analyses.Results: We present the results from experiments that investigate the validity of using semantic similarity by comparison with sequence similarity.We show a simple extension that enables a semantic search of the knowledge held within sequence databases.Availability: Software available fromhttp://www.russet.org.ukContact:p.lord@russet.org.uk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184145200014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/10/1275/184514/Investigating-semantic-similarity-measures-across	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg153	NULL	http://www.russet.org.uk,http://p.lord@russet.org.uk	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=wwwww111	NULL

profiles"	http://www.columbia.edu/~ay1/,http://ay1@columbia.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	28	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	An-Suei Yang,Lu-yong Wang	NULL	Motivation: A large body of experimental and theoretical evidencesuggests that local structural determinants are frequently encoded in shortsegments of protein sequence. Although the local structural information,once recognized, is particularly useful in protein structural and functionalanalyses, it remains a difficult problem to identify embedded localstructural codes based solely on sequence information.Results: In this paper, we describe a local structure predictionmethod aiming at predicting the backbone structures of nine-residue sequencesegments. Two elements are the keys for this local structure predictionprocedure. The first key element is the LSBSP1 database, which contains alarge number of non-redundant local structure-based sequence profiles fornine-residue structure segments. The second key element is the consensusapproach, which identifies a consensus structure from a set of hitstructures. The local structure prediction procedure starts by matching aquery sequence segment of nine consecutive amino acid residues to all thesequence profiles in the local structure-based sequence profile database(LSBSP1). The consensus structure, which is at the center of the largeststructural cluster of the hit structures, is predicted to be the nativestate structure adopted by the query sequence segment. This local structureprediction method is assessed with a large set of random test proteinstructures that have not been used in constructing the LSBSP1 database. Thebenchmark results indicate that the prediction capacities of the novel localstructure prediction procedure exceed the prediction capacities of the localbackbone structure prediction methods based on the I-sites library by asignificant margin.Availability: All the computational and assessment procedures havebeen implemented in the integrated computational system PrISM.1 (ProteinInformatics System for Modeling).

Ding	NULL	Motivation: Selection of genes most relevant and informative for certain phenotypes is an important aspect in gene expression analysis. Most current methods select genes based on known phenotype information. However, certain set of genes may correspond to new phenotypes which are yet unknown, and it is important to develop novel effectiveselection methods for their discovery without using any prior phenotype information.Results: We propose and study a new method to select relevant genes based on their similarity information only. The method relies on a mechanism for discarding irrelevant genes.A two-way ordering of gene expression data can force irrelevant genes towardsthe middle in the ordering and thus can be discarded. Mechanisms based on variance and principal component analysis are also studied. When applied to expression profiles of colon cancer and leukemia,the unsupervised method outperforms the baseline algorithm that simply uses all genes, and it also selects relevant genes close to those selected using supervised methods.Supplement: More results and software are online:http://www.nersc.gov/~cding/2wayContact:chqding@lbl.gov*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184145200012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/10/1259/184448/Unsupervised-feature-selection-via-two-way	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg149	NULL	http://www.nersc.gov/~cding/2way,http://chqding@lbl.gov	NULL	NULL

By means of thelatter, chemical compounds are represented as sets of substructures whichare ‘biologically meaningful’ from the expert point of view.Results: The chosen learning model and representation language showcomparatively good performance for the PTC dataset: for three sex/speciesgroups the predictions were ROC optimal, for one group the prediction wasnearly optimal. The predictions tend to be conservative (few predictions andalmost no errors), which can be explained by the specific features of thelearning model.Availability: by request tofinn@viniti.ru;serge@viniti.ru,http://ki-www2.intellektik.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~jsm/QDAContact:serge@viniti.ru*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184145200004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/10/1201/184178/Toxicology-analysis-by-means-of-the-JSM-method	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg096	NULL	http://finn@viniti.ru,http://serge@viniti.ru,http://ki-www2.intellektik.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~jsm/QDA,http://serge@viniti.ru	NULL	NULL

The method was applied to two different sets of cancerprofiling studies. The change of gene expression in cancer was expressed as ’ effect size’, a standardized index measuring the magnitude of a treatment or covariate effect. The effect sizes were combined to obtain the estimateof the overall mean. The statistical significance was determined by apermutation test extended to multiple datasets. It was shown that the dataintegration promotes the discovery of small but consistent expressionchanges with increased sensitivity and reliability. The effect size methodsprovided the efficient modeling framework for addressing interstudyvariation as well. Based on the result of homogeneity tests, a fixed effectsmodel was adopted for one set of datasets that had been created incontrolled experimental conditions. By contrast, a random effects model wasshown to be appropriate for the other set of datasets that had beenpublished by independent groups.

Therefore, the cost of similarity queries increases linearly as the volume of the protein databases increase.As the sizes of experimentally determined andtheoretically estimated protein structure databases grow,there is a need for scalable searching techniques.Results: Our techniques extract feature vectors on triplets ofSSEs (Secondary Structure Elements).Later, these feature vectors are indexed using a multidimensionalindex structure.For a given query protein, this index structure is usedto quickly prune away unpromising proteins in the database. The remaining proteins are then aligned using a popularalignment tool such as VAST.We also develop a novel statistical model to estimate thegoodnessof a match using the SSEs.Experimental results show that our techniques improve thepruning time of VAST 3 to 3.5 times while maintainingsimilar sensitivity.Contact:orhan@cs.ucsb.edu;tamer@cs.ucsb.edu;ambuj@cs.ucsb.edu.Keywords: Protein structures, feature vectors, indexing*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i81/227733/PSI-indexing-protein-structures-for-fast	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1009	NULL	http://orhan@cs.ucsb.edu,http://tamer@cs.ucsb.edu,http://ambuj@cs.ucsb.edu	NULL	NULL

Previously, orthology analysis and reconciliation has been performed only with respect to the parsimony model. This discards many plausible solutions and sometimes precludes finding the correct one. In many other areas in bioinformatics probabilistic models have proven to be both more realistic and powerful than parsimony models. For instance, they allow for assessing solution reliability and consideration of alternative solutions in a uniform way. There is also an added benefit in making model assumptions explicit and therefore making model comparisons possible.For orthology analysis, uncertainty has recently been addressed using parsimonious reconciliation combined with bootstrap techniques. However, until now no probabilistic methods have been available.Results: We introduce a probabilistic gene evolution model based on a birth-death process in which a gene tree evolves ‘inside’ a species tree.Based on this model, we develop a tool with the capacity to perform practical orthology analysis, based on Fitch’s original definition, and more generally for reconciling pairs of gene and species trees. Our gene evolution model is biologically sound (Neiet al., 1997) and intuitively attractive. We develop a Bayesian analysis based on MCMC which facilitates approximation of ana posterioridistribution for reconciliations.That is, we can find the most probable reconciliations and estimate the probability of any reconciliation, given the observed gene tree. This also gives a way to estimate the probability that a pair of genes are orthologs.The main algorithmic contribution presented here consists of an algorithm for computing the likelihood of a given reconciliation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful introduction of this type of probabilistic methods, which flourish in phylogeny analysis, into reconciliation and orthology analysis.The MCMC algorithm has been implemented and, although not yet being in its final form, tests show that it performs very well on synthetic as well as biological data.Using standard correspondences, our results carry over to allele trees as well as biogeography.Contact:{lottab,jensl}@nada.kth.se,{bengt.sennblad,lars.arvestad}@sbc.su.se*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i7/227628/Bayesian-gene-species-tree-reconciliation-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1000	NULL	http://lottab,jensl@nada.kth.se,http://bengt.sennblad,lars.arvestad@sbc.su.se	NULL	NULL

  approach"	http://cai@cs.uga.edu,http://russell@plantbio.uga.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	21	16	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Liming Cai,Russell L. Malmberg,Yunzhou Wu	NULL	Motivation: Modeling RNA pseudoknotted structures remains challenging. Methods have previously been developed to model RNA stem-loops successfully using stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG) adapted from computational linguistics; however, the additional complexity of pseudoknots has made modeling them more difficult. Formally a context-sensitive grammar is required, which would impose a large increase in complexity.Results: We introduce a new grammar modeling approach for RNA pseudoknotted structures based on parallel communicating grammar systems (PCGS). Our new approach can specify pseudoknotted structures, while avoiding context-sensitive rules, using a single CFG synchronized with a number of regular grammars. Technically, the stochastic version of the grammar model can be as simple as an SCFG. As with SCFG, the new approach permits automatic generation of a single-RNA structure prediction algorithm for each specified pseudoknotted structure model. This approach also makes it possible to develop full probabilistic models of pseudoknotted structures to allow the prediction of consensus structures by comparative analysis and structural homology recognition in database searches.Availability: Prototypes for the automated pseudoknot predictionalgorithm are available upon request.Contact:cai@cs.uga.edu;russell@plantbio.uga.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i66/227712/Stochastic-modeling-of-RNA-pseudoknotted	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1007	NULL	http://cai@cs.uga.edu,http://russell@plantbio.uga.edu	NULL	NULL

Do,Olivier Couronne,Inna Dubchak,Serafim Batzoglou	NULL	Motivation: To compare entire genomes from different species,biologists increasingly need alignment methods that are efficient enough to handle long sequences, and accurate enough to correctly align the conservedbiological features between distant species. The two main classes ofpairwise alignments areglobalalignment, where one string is transformed into theother, andlocalalignment, where all locations of similarity between the twostrings are returned. Global alignments are less prone to demonstratingfalse homology as each letter of one sequence is constrained to beingaligned to only one letter of the other. Local alignments, on the otherhand, can cope with rearrangements between non-syntenic, orthologous sequencesby identifying similar regions in sequences; this, however, comes at theexpense of a higher false positive rate due to the inability of localaligners to take into account overall conservation maps.Results: In this paper we introduce the notion ofglocalalignment, acombination of global and local methods, where one creates a map thattransforms one sequence into the other while allowing for rearrangementevents. We present Shuffle-LAGAN, a glocal alignment algorithm that is basedon the CHAOS local alignment algorithm and the LAGAN global aligner, and isable to align long genomic sequences. To test Shuffle-LAGAN we split themouse genome into BAC-sized pieces, and aligned these pieces to the humangenome. We demonstrate that Shuffle-LAGAN compares favorably in terms ofsensitivity and specificity with standard local and global aligners. Fromthe alignments we conclude that about 9% of human/mouse homology may beattributed to small rearrangements, 63% of which are duplications.Availability: Our systems, supplemental information, and thealignment of the human and mouse genomes using Shuffle-LAGAN are availableathttp://lagan.stanford.edu/glocalContact:serafim@cs.stanford.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†These authors contributed equally to the work.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i54/227687/Glocal-alignment-finding-rearrangements-during	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1005	NULL	http://lagan.stanford.edu/glocal,http://serafim@cs.stanford.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=ttttwwww	NULL

Mutation-induced sequence variations are playing an important role in the development of cancer, among others.From this, it is clear that SNP and mutation discovery is of great interest in today’s Life Sciences.Currently, such discovery is often performed utilizing electrophoresis-based Sanger Sequencing.Discovery of SNPs can also be performed by multiple sequence alignment of publicly available sequence data, but recent studies indicate that only a small percentage of SNPs can be discovered using this approach and, in particular, that SNPs with low frequency are often missed.Other SNP discovery methods only indicate the presence of a SNP in a sample region, but fail to resolve its characterization and localization.Results: We present a method to discover mutations and SNPs usingbase-specific cleavageandmass spectrometry.An amplicon of known reference sequence with length usually between 100 and 1000 nt is amplified, transcribed, and cleaved using base-specific endonucleases such as RNAse A or T1.The resulting cleavage products (or fragments) are analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and, comparing the measured spectra with those predictedin-silico, the goal is to discover and pinpoint sequence variations of the sample sequence compared to the reference sequence.A time-efficient algorithm for discovering sequence variations is presented that enables fast analysis of such variations even if the sample sequence differs significantly from the reference sequence.Contact:boecker@CeBiTec.uni-bielefeld.de*Currently at AG Genome Informatics, TechnischeFakultät, Universität Bielefeld, Germany.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i44/227679/SNP-and-mutation-discovery-using-base-specific	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1004	NULL	http://boecker@CeBiTec.uni-bielefeld.de	NULL	NULL

Morgan	NULL	Motivation: The biological literature is a major repository of knowledge. Many biological databases draw much of their content from a careful curation of this literature. However, as the volume of literature increases, the burden of curation increases. Text mining may provide useful tools to assist in the curation process. To date, the lack of standards has made it impossible to determine whether text mining techniques are sufficiently mature to be useful.Results: We report on a Challenge Evaluation task that we created for the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Challenge Cup. We provided a training corpus of 862 articles consisting of journal articles curated in FlyBase, along with the associated lists of genes and gene products, as well as the relevant data fields from FlyBase. For the test, we provided a corpus of 213 new (‘blind’) articles; the 18 participating groups provided systemsthat flagged articles for curation, based on whether the article containedexperimental evidence for gene expression products.We report on theevaluation results and describe the techniques used by the top performing groups.Contact:asy@mitre.orgKeywords: text mining, evaluation, curation, genomics, data management*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200048&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i331/228286/Evaluation-of-text-data-mining-for-database	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1046	NULL	http://asy@mitre.org	NULL	NULL

Kulp,David Haussler	NULL	Motivation: Alternative splicing allows a single gene to generatemultiple mRNAs, which can be translated into functionally and structurallydiverse proteins. One gene can have multiple variants coexisting atdifferent concentrations. Estimating the relative abundance of each variantis important for the study of underlying biological function. Microarraysare standard tools that measure gene expression. But most design andanalysis has not accounted for splice variants. Thus splice variant-specificchip designs and analysis algorithms are needed for accurate gene expressionprofiling.Results: Inspired by Li and Wong (2001),we developed a gene structure-based algorithm to determine therelative abundance of known splice variants. Probe intensities are modeledacross multiple experiments using gene structures as constraints. Model parameters are obtained through a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)process/framework. The algorithm produces the relative concentration of eachvariant, as well as an affinity term associated with each probe.

Moret	NULL	Motivation: Phylogenetic reconstruction from gene-order data has attracted increasing attention from both biologists and computer scientists over the last few years.Methods used in reconstruction include distance-based methods (such as neighbor-joining), parsimony methods using sequence-based encodings, Bayesian approaches, and direct optimization.The latter, pioneered by Sankoff and extended by us with the software suite GRAPPA, is the most accurate approach, but cannot handle more than about 15 genomes of limited size (e.g. organelles).Results: We report here on our successful efforts to scale up direct optimization through a two-step approach: the first step decomposes the dataset into smaller pieces and runs the direct optimization (GRAPPA) on the smaller pieces, while the second step builds a tree from the results obtained on the smaller pieces.We used the sophisticated disk-covering method (DCM) pioneered by Warnow and her group, suitably modified to take into account the computational limitations of GRAPPA. We find that DCM-GRAPPA scales gracefully to at least 1000 genomes of a few hundred genes each and retains surprisingly high accuracy throughout the range: in our experiments, the topological error rate rarely exceeded a few percent.Thus, reconstruction based on gene-order data can now be accomplished with high accuracy on datasets of significant size.Availability: All of our software is available in source form under GPL athttp://www.compbio.unm.eduContact:moret@cs.unm.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200044&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i305/228221/Scaling-up-accurate-phylogenetic-reconstruction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1042	NULL	http://www.compbio.unm.edu,http://moret@cs.unm.edu	NULL	NULL

Karp	NULL	Motivation: The binding of transcription factors to specific regulatory sequenceelements is a primary mechanism for controlling gene transcription. Recent findings suggest a modular organization of binding sites for transcription factors that cooperate in theregulation of genes. In this work we establish aframework for finding recurrent cis-regulatorymodules in the promoters of a selected set of genes andscoring their statistical significance.Results: Proceeding from a database of identified binding site motifs and theirgenomic locations we seek motifs whose frequencyin the selected promoters is differentthan in a background promoter set.We present several statistical tests designed for this purpose.We provide a hashing algorithm for detecting combinations of these motifs that co-occur in clusters within the selectedpromoters. The significance of such co-occurrences is evaluated using novelstatistical scores.Our methods are combined in CREME, a suite of softwarewhich includes a browser for viewing the pattern of occurrence of selected cis-regulatory modules.We applied our methodology to find modules within human-mouseconserved promoter segments, focusing on cell cycle regulated genes and stress response related genes. To validate the biological significance of theidentified modules we tested whether the associated genes tended to be co-expressed or share similar function.In the cell cycle set five ofthe seven identified sets of genes were coherently expressed.On the stress response data four of thesix detected sets fell predominantly intowell-defined functional sub-categories.Availability:http://icsi.berkeley.edu/~roded/creme.htmlContact:roded@icsi.berkeley.edu.Keywords: Cis-regulatory module, transcription factor binding site, motif cluster,statistical test.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†These authors contributed equallyto this work.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200041&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i283/228182/CREME-a-framework-for-identifying-cis-regulatory	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1039	NULL	http://icsi.berkeley.edu/~roded/creme.html,http://roded@icsi.berkeley.edu.

Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation.The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology.However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation.The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance.Results: We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for thehorizontaldependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values.The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework.We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models.Partially supervised learning—adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters—is supported. A graphical user interface allowsquering an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters.We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.Availability: The software is freely available athttp://algorithmics.molgen.mpg.de/ghmmContact:schliep@molgen.mpg.deKeywords: Gene Expression, time course, model-based clustering, Hidden Markov Models*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200038&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i255/228137/Using-hidden-Markov-models-to-analyze-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1036	NULL	http://algorithmics.molgen.mpg.de/ghmm,http://schliep@molgen.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

But from the view of function, mostrestraints of evolutionary divergence operate at the level of tertiarystructure. It has been demonstrated that quantitative measures ofdissimilarity in families of structurally similar proteins can be applied tothe construction of trees from a comparison of their three-dimensionalstructures. However, no convenient tool is publicly available to carry outsuch analyses.Results: We developed STRUCLA (STRUcture CLAssification), a WWW tool forgeneration of trees based on evolutionary distances inferred from proteinstructures according to various methods. The server takes as an input a listof PDB files or the initial alignment of protein coordinates provided by theuser (for instance exported from SWISS PDB VIEWER). The user specifies the distance cutoff and selects the distance measures. The server returns seriesof unrooted trees in the NEXUS format and corresponding distance matrices,as well as a consensus tree.

The specific atomiccomposition and three-dimensional geometric restraints of protein bindingsites for different ligands could be easily obtained from there.

Blagov	NULL	Motivation: A new method is developed to query a relational database in natural language (NL).Results: The method, based on a semantic approach, interprets grammatical and lexical units of a natural language into concepts of subject domain, which are given in a conceptual scheme. The conceptual scheme is mapped formally onto the logical scheme. We applied the method to query the FlyEx database in natural language. FlyEx contains information on the expression of segmentation genes inDrosophila melanogaster. The method allows formulation of queries in various natural languages simultaneously, and is adaptive to changes in the knowledge domain and user’s views. It provides optimal transformation of queries from natural language to SQL, as well as visualization of information as a hyperscheme. The method does not require specification of all possible language constructions as well as a standard grammar accuracy in formulation of NL queries.Availability:http://urchin.spbcas.ru/NLP/NLP.htmlContact:samson@spbcas.ruKeywords: natural language processing, relational databases, conceptual scheme, segmentation genes,D.melanogaster, query optimization.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200035&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i241/228081/Processing-of-natural-language-queries-to-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1033	NULL	http://urchin.spbcas.ru/NLP/NLP.html,http://samson@spbcas.ru	NULL	NULL

Their content ranges from about 10 to30% of the cell proteins, based on sequence comparison and specificpredictive methods. Due to the paucity of membrane proteins solved withatomic resolution, the training/testing sets of predictive methods forprotein topography and topology routinely include very few well-solvedstructures mixed with a hundred proteins known with low resolution.Moreover, available predictors fail in predicting recently crystallisedmembrane proteins (Chenet al., 2002). Presently the number of well-solvedmembrane proteins comprises some 59 chains of low sequence homology. It istherefore possible to train/test predictors only with the set of proteinsknown with atomic resolution and evaluate more thoroughly the performance ofdifferent methods.Results: We implement a cascade-neural network (NN), two differenthidden Markov models (HMM), and their ensemble (ENSEMBLE) as a new method.We train and test in cross validation the three methods and ENSEMBLE on the59 well resolved membrane proteins. ENSEMBLE scores with a per-proteinaccuracy of 90% for topography and 71% for topology, outperforming thebest single method of 7 and 5 percentage points, respectively. When testedon a low resolution set of 151 proteins, with no homology with the 59proteins, the per-protein accuracy of ENSEMBLE is 76% for topography and68% for topology.

Lagergren	NULL	Motivation:The identification of regulatory control regions within genomes is a major challenge. Studies have demonstrated that regulating regions can be described as locally dense clusters or modules ofcis-acting transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). For well-described biological contexts, it is possible to train predictive algorithms to discern novel modules in genome sequences. However, utility of module detection methods has been severely limited by insufficient training data. For only a few tissues can one obtain sufficient numbers of literature-derived regulatory modules.Results: We present a novel method, MSCAN, that circumvents the training data problem by measuring the statistical significance of any non-overlapping combination of TFBS in a window. Given a set of transcription factor binding profiles, a significance threshold, and a genomic sequence, MSCAN returns putative regulatory regions. We assess performance on two curated collections of regulatory regions; one each for tissue-specific expression in liver and skeletal muscle cells.

The evolution of drug-resistant genetic variants in response to therapy plays a key role in treatment failure and finding a new potent drug combination after therapy failure is considered challenging.Results: To estimate the activity of a drug combination against a particular viral strain, we develop a scoring function whose independent variables describe a set of antiviral agents and viral DNA sequences coding for the molecular targets of the respective drugs. The construction of this activity score involves (1) predicting phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes for each drug individually, (2) probabilistic modeling of predicted resistance values and integration into a score for drug combinations, and (3) searching through the mutational neighborhood of the considered strain in order to estimate activity on nearby mutants. For a clinical data set, we determine the optimal search depth and show that the scoring scheme is predictive of therapeutic outcome.

298	Protein structure prediction via combinatorial assembly of sub-structural units	http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~inbaryuv/combdock/,http://inbaryuv@tau.ac.il	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	17	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yuval Inbar,Hadar Benyamini,Ruth Nussinov,Haim J. Wolfson	NULL	Following the hierarchical nature of protein folding, we propose a three-stage scheme for the prediction of a protein structure from its sequence. First, the sequence is cut to fragments that are each assigneda structure. Second, the assigned structures are combinatorially assembled to form the overall 3D organization. Third, highly ranked predicted arrangements are completed and refined.This work focuses on the second stage of this scheme: the combinatorial assembly. We presentCombDock, a combinatorial docking algorithm.CombDockgets an ordered set of protein sub-structures and predicts the inter-contacts that define their overall organization.We reduce the combinatorial assembly to a graph-theory problem, and give a heuristic polynomial solution to this computationally hard problem. We appliedCombDockto various examples of structural units of two types: protein domains and building blocks, which are relatively stable sub-structures of domains. Moreover, we testedCombDockusing increasingly distorted input, where the native structural units were replaced by similarly folded units extracted from homologous proteins and, in the more difficult cases, from globally unrelated proteins. The algorithm is robust, showing low sensitivity to input distortion. This suggests thatCombDockis a useful tool in protein structure prediction that may be applied to large target proteins.Supplementary information: More tables and figures are available atwww.cs.tau.ac.il/~inbaryuv/combdock/Contact:inbaryuv@tau.ac.ilKeywords: structure prediction, multiple docking, hierarchical model, combinatorial assembly.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200022&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i158/227881/Protein-structure-prediction-via-combinatorial	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1020	NULL	http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~inbaryuv/combdock/,http://inbaryuv@tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL

Singh	NULL	Motivation: Comparative analysis of metabolic pathways in different genomes can give insights into the understanding of evolutionary and organizational relationships among species. This type of analysis allows one to measure the evolution of complete processes (with different functional roles) rather than the individual elements of a conventional analysis.We present a new technique for the phylogenetic analysis of metabolic pathways based on the topology of the underlying graphs. A distance measure between graphs is defined using the similarity between nodes of the graphs and the structural relationship between them. This distance measure is applied to the enzyme-enzyme relational graphs derived from metabolic pathways. Using this approach, pathways and group of pathways of different organisms are compared to each other and the resulting distance matrix is used to obtain a phylogenetic tree.Results: We apply the method to the Citric Acid Cycleand the Glycolysis pathways of different groups of organisms, as well as to the Carbohydrate metabolic networks. Phylogenetic trees obtained from the experiments were close to existing phylogenies and revealed interesting relationships among organisms.Availability: Software available upon request from the authors.Supplementary information: The technical report is available athttp://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~maureen/TR200233.pdfContact:ambuj@cs.ucsb.eduKeywords: phylogenetic trees, metabolic pathways, graph comparison*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200020&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i138/227854/Deriving-phylogenetic-trees-from-the-similarity	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1018	NULL	http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~maureen/TR200233.pdf,http://ambuj@cs.ucsb.edu	NULL	NULL
301	"Sensitive pattern discovery with ‘fuzzy’ alignments of distantly
related proteins"	http://Liisa.Holm@Helsinki.fi	ORIGINAL PAPER	3	9	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Andreas Heger,Liisa Holm	NULL	Motivation: Evolutionary comparison leads to efficient functionalcharacterisation of hypothetical proteins. Here, our goal is to map specificsequence patterns to putative functional classes. The evolutionary signalstands out most clearly in a maximally diverse set of homologues. Thisdiversity, however, leads to a number of technical difficulties. Thetargeted patterns—as gleaned from structure comparisons—are too sparsefor statistically significant signals of sequence similarity and accuratemultiple sequence alignment.Results: We address this problem by a fuzzy alignment model, whichprobabilistically assigns residues to structurally equivalent positions(attributes) of the proteins. We then apply multivariate analysis to the‘attributes x proteins’ matrix. The dimensionality of the space is reducedusing non-negative matrix factorization. The method is general, fullyautomatic and works without assumptions about pattern density, minimumsupport, explicit multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees, etc. Wedemonstrate the discovery of biologically meaningful patterns in anextremely diverse superfamily related to urease.Contact:Liisa.Holm@Helsinki.fi*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200019&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i130/227841/Sensitive-pattern-discovery-with-fuzzy-alignments	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1017	NULL	http://Liisa.Holm@Helsinki.fi	NULL	NULL
302	Detecting protein sequence conservation via metric embeddings	http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eran/projects/embed,http://eran@eecs.berkeley.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	8	5	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	E. Halperin,J. Buhler,R. Karp,R. Krauthgamer,B. Westover	NULL	Motivation: Comparing two protein databases is a fundamental task in biosequence annotation.Given two databases, one must find all pairs of proteins that align with high score under a biologically meaningful substitution score matrix, such as a BLOSUM matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). Distance-based approaches to this problem map each peptide in the database to a point in a metric space, such that peptides aligning with higher scores are mapped to closer points.Many techniques exist to discover close pairs of points in a metric space efficiently, but the challenge in applying this work to proteomic comparison is to find a distance mapping that accurately encodes all the distinctions among residue pairs made by a proteomic score matrix. Buhler (2002) proposed one such mapping but found that it led to a relatively inefficient algorithm for protein-protein comparison.Results: This work proposes a new distance mapping for peptides under the BLOSUM matrices that permits more efficient similarity search.We first propose a new distance function on peptides derived from a given score matrix. We then show how to map peptides to bit vectors such that the distance between any two peptides is closely approximated by theHamming distance(i.e. number of mismatches) between their corresponding bit vectors.We combine these two results with thelsh-all-pairs-simalgorithm of Buhler (2002) to produce an improved distance-based algorithm for proteomic comparison.An initial implementation of the improved algorithm exhibits sensitivity within 5% of that of the originallsh-all-pairs-sim, while running up to eight times faster.Availability: The source of the code can be found athttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eran/projects/embedContact:eran@eecs.berkeley.eduKeywords: protein comparison, database indexing, metric embedding, Hamming space*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200018&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i122/227831/Detecting-protein-sequence-conservation-via-metric	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1016	NULL	http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eran/projects/embed,http://eran@eecs.berkeley.edu	NULL	NULL

304	Chain functions and scoring functions in genetic networks	http://iritg,rshamir@post.tau.ac.il	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	9	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	I. Gat-Viks,R. Shamir	NULL	One of the grand challenges of system biology is to reconstruct the network of regulatory control among genes and proteins. High throughput data, particularly from expression experiments, may gradually make this possible in the future. Here we address two key ingredients in any such ‘reverse engineering’ effort: The choice of a biologically relevant, yet restricted, set of potential regulation functions, and the appropriate score to evaluate candidate regulatory relations.We propose a set of regulation functions which we call chain functions, and argue for their ubiquity in biological networks. We analyze their complexity and show that their number is exponentially smaller than all boolean functions of the same dimension. We define two new scores: one evaluating the fitness of a candidate set of regulators of a particular gene, and the other evaluating a candidate function. Both scores use established statistical methods. Finally, we test our methods on experimental gene expression data from the yeast galactose pathway. We show the utility of using chain functions and the improved inference using our scores in comparison to several extant scores. We demonstrate that the combined use of the two scores gives an extra advantage. We expect both chain functions and the new scores to be helpful in future attempts to infer regulatory networks.Contact:{iritg,rshamir}@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i108/227801/Chain-functions-and-scoring-functions-in-genetic	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1014	NULL	http://iritg,rshamir@post.tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL
305	Annotation of bacterial genomes using improved phylogenomic profiles	http://enault@igs.cnrs-mrs.fr	ORIGINAL PAPER	11	20	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	F. Enault,K. Suhre,C. Abergel,O. Poirot,J.-M. Claverie	NULL	Motivation: Phylogenomic profiling is a large-scale comparative genomic method used to infer protein function from evolutionary information first described in a binary form by Pellegriniet al.(1999). Here, we propose improvements of this approach including the use of normalized Blastp bit scores, a normalization of the matrix of profiles to take into account the evolutionary distances between bacteria, the definition of a phylogenomic neighborhood based on continuous pairwise distances between genes and an original annotation procedure including the computation of ap-value for each functional assignment.Results: The method presented here increases the number of Ecocyc enzymes identified as being evolutionarily related by about 25% with respect to the original binary form (absent/present) method. The fraction of ‘false’ positives is shown to be smaller than 20%.Based on their phylogenomic relationships, genes of unknown function can then be automatically related to annotated genes.Each gene annotation predicted is associated with ap-value, i.e. its probability to be obtained by chance. The validity of this method was extensively tested on a large set of genes of known function using the MultiFun database. We find that 50% of 3122 function attributions that can be made at ap-value level of 10−11correspond to the actual gene annotation. The method can be readily applied to any newly sequenced microbial genome. In contrast to earlier work on the same topic, our approach avoids the use of arbitrary cut-off values, and provides a reliability estimate of the functional predictions in form ofp-values.Contact:enault@igs.cnrs-mrs.frKeywords: phylogenomics, functional prediction, automated annotation, bacteria, evolution.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2003-07-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434200015&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i105/227789/Annotation-of-bacterial-genomes-using-improved	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1013	NULL	http://enault@igs.cnrs-mrs.fr	NULL	NULL

and centrality of metabolic networks"	http://aze@gbf.de,http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/	ORIGINAL PAPER	90	189	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Hong-Wu Ma,An-Ping Zeng	NULL	Motivation:Structural and functional analysis of genome-basedlarge-scale metabolic networks is important for understanding the designprinciples and regulation of the metabolism at a system level. The metabolic networkis conventionally considered to be highly integrated and very complex. Arational reduction of the metabolic network to its core structure and a deeperunderstanding of its functional modules are important.Results: In this work, we show that the metabolites in a metabolicnetwork are far from fully connected. A connectivity structure consisting offour major subsets of metabolites and reactions, i.e. a fully connectedsub-network, a substrate subset, a product subset and an isolated subset isfound to exist in metabolic networks of 65 fully sequenced organisms. Thelargest fully connected part of a metabolic network, called ‘the giantstrong component (GSC)’, represents the most complicated part and the coreof the network and has the feature of scale-free networks. The average pathlength of the whole network is primarily determined by that of the GSC. For mostof the organisms, GSC normally contains less than one-third of the nodes ofthe network. This connectivity structure is very similar to the‘ bow-tie’structure of World Wide Web. Our results indicate that the bow-tie structuremay be common for large-scale directed networks. More importantly, theuncovered structure feature makes a structural and functional analysis oflarge-scale metabolic network more amenable. As shown in this work,comparing the closeness centrality of the nodes in the GSC can identify the mostcentral metabolites of a metabolic network. To quantitatively characterizethe overall connection structure of the GSC we introduced the term ‘overallcloseness centralization index (OCCI)’. OCCI correlates well with theaverage path length of the GSC and is a useful parameter for a system-levelcomparison of metabolic networks of different organisms.Contact:aze@gbf.deSupplementary Information:http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500017&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1423/220836/The-connectivity-structure-giant-strong-component	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg177	NULL	http://aze@gbf.de,http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Edgar,Kimmen Sjölander	NULL	Motivation:Aligning multiple proteins based on sequenceinformation alone is challenging if sequence identity is low or there is asignificant degree of structural divergence. We present a novel algorithm(SATCHMO) that is designed to address this challenge. SATCHMO simultaneouslyconstructs a tree and a set of multiple sequence alignments, one for eachinternal node of the tree. The alignment at a given node contains allsequences within its sub-tree, and predicts which positions in thosesequences are alignable and which are not. Aligned regions thereforetypically get shorter on a path from a leaf to the root as sequences divergein structure. Current methods either regard all positions as alignable(e.g. ClustalW), or align only those positions believed to be homologousacross all sequences (e.g. profile HMM methods); by contrast SATCHMO makesdifferent predictions of alignable regions in different subgroups. SATCHMO generates profile hidden Markov models at each node; these are used todetermine branching order, to align sequences and to predict structurallyalignable regions.Results: In experiments on the BAliBASE benchmark alignmentdatabase, SATCHMO is shown to perform comparably to ClustalW and the UCSCSAM HMM software. Results using SATCHMO to identify protein domains aredemonstrated on potassium channels, with implications for the mechanism bywhich tumor necrosis factor alpha affects potassium current.Availability: The software is available for download fromhttp://www.drive5.com/lobster/index.htmContact:bob@drive5.com*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1404/220197/SATCHMO-sequence-alignment-and-tree-construction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg158	NULL	http://www.drive5.com/lobster/index.htm,http://bob@drive5.com	NULL	NULL

protein sequence database searching"	http://geoff@compbio.dundee.ac.uk	ORIGINAL PAPER	1	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Caleb Webber,Geoffrey J. Barton	NULL	Motivation: Sequence alignment methods that compare two sequences (pairwise methods) are important tools for the detection of biological sequence relationships.In genome annotation, multiple methods are often run andagreement between methods taken as confirmation.In this paper, we assess the advantages of combining search methods by comparing seven pairwisealignment methods, including three local dynamic programming algorithms(PRSS, SSEARCH and SCANPS), two global dynamic programming algorithms(GSRCH and AMPS) and two heuristic approximations (BLAST and FASTA),individually and by pairwise intersection and union of their resultlists at equalp-value cut-offs.Results: When applied singly, the dynamic programming methods SCANPS and SSEARCH gave significantly better coverage (p=0.01) compared to AMPS, GSRCH, PRSS, BLAST and FASTA.Results ranked by BLASTp-values gave significantly better coverage compared to ranking by BLASTe-values.Of 56 combinations of eight methods considered, 19 gave significant increases in coverage at low error compared to the parent methodsat an equalp-value cutoff.The union of results by BLAST (p-value) and FASTA at an equalp-value cutoff gave significantly better coverage than either method individually.The best overall performance was obtained from the intersection of the results from SSEARCH and the GSRCH62 global alignment method.At an error level of five false positives, this combination found 444 true positives, a significant 12.4% increase over SSEARCH applied alone.Contact:geoff@compbio.dundee.ac.uk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1397/220141/Increased-coverage-obtained-by-combination-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg156	NULL	http://geoff@compbio.dundee.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

based on the longest increasing subsequence algorithm"	http://me@hongyu.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	46	17	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Hongyu Zhang	NULL	Motivation:The popular BLAST algorithm is based on a localsimilarity search strategy, so its high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) do not have global alignment information. When scientists use BLAST to search for atarget protein or DNA sequence in a huge database like the human genome map,the existence of repeated fragments, homologues or pseudogenes in the genomeoften makes the BLAST result filled with redundant HSPs. Therefore, we needa computational strategy to alleviate this problem.Results: In the gene discovery group of Celera Genomics, Ideveloped a two-step method, i.e. a BLAST step plus an LIS step, to alignthousands of cDNA and protein sequences into the human genome map. The LISstep is based on a mature computational algorithm, Longest IncreasingSubsequence (LIS) algorithm. The idea is to use the LIS algorithm to findthe longest series of consecutive HSPs in the BLAST output. Such a BLAST+LISstrategy can be used as an independent alignment tool or as a complementarytool for other alignment programs like Sim4 and GenWise. It can also work asa general purpose BLAST result processor in all sorts of BLAST searches.Two examples from Celera were shown in this paper.Contact:me@hongyu.org*Present address: Ceres Inc., 3007 Malibu Canyon Road, Malibu, CA 90265, USA.	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1391/220556/Alignment-of-BLAST-high-scoring-segment-pairs	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg168	NULL	http://me@hongyu.org	NULL	NULL

Mathura,Catherine H. Schein,Werner Braun	NULL	Motivation: Identification of short conserved sequence motifscommon to a protein family or superfamily can be more useful than overallsequence similarity in suggesting the function of novel gene products.Locating motifs still requires expert knowledge, as automated methods usingstringent criteria may not differentiate subtle similarities fromstatistical noise.Results: We have developed a novel automatic method, based onpatterns of conservation of 237 physical–chemical properties of amino acidsin aligned protein sequences, to find related motifs in proteins with littleor no overall sequence similarity. As an application, our web-server MASIAidentified 12 property-based motifs in the apurinic/apyrimidinicendonuclease (APE) family of DNA-repair enzymes of the DNase-I superfamily.Searching with these motifs located distantly related representatives of theDNase-I superfamily, such as Inositol 5′-polyphosphate phosphatases in theASTRAL40 database, using a Bayesian scoring function. Other proteinscontaining APE motifs had no overall sequence or structural similarity.However, all were phosphatases and/or had a metal ion binding active site.Thus our automated method can identify discrete elements in distantly related proteins that define local structure and aspects of function.

Recently it has been shown that some translation isregulated by the readthrough reactions although the complete mechanism isnot clear. Therefore, the discovery of ‘readthrough genes’ is importantfor further investigation of their cellular roles, which may provideadditional insights into the mechanism of translational regulation.Results: We constructed a system that lists candidates ofreadthrough genes based on the existence of a ‘protein motif’ at the 3′untranslated region (UTR). Using this system, we extracted 85 candidatesfrom 4082 nucleic acid sequences ofDrosophila melanogasterin GenBank database. The sequences ofthese candidates had a slightly more stable secondary structure anddifferent base preferences compared to the non-candidates.

genes measured by DNA microarrays"	http://sod@cs.wayne.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	8	39	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Sorin Draghici,Olga Kulaeva,Bruce Hoff,Anton Petrov,Soheil Shams,Michael A. Tainsky	NULL	Motivation: A crucial step in microarray data analysis is the selection of subsets of interesting genes from the initial set of genes.In many cases, especially when comparing a specific condition to a reference, the genes of interest are those which are differentially expressed. Two common methods for gene selection are: (a) selection by fold difference (at leastnfold variation) and (b) selection by altered ratio (at leastnstandard deviations away from the mean ratio).Results: The novel method proposed here is based on ANOVA and uses replicate spots to estimate an empirical distribution of the noise. The measured intensity range is divided in a number of intervals. A noise distribution is constructed for each such interval. Bootstrapping is used to map the desired confidence levels from the noise distribution corresponding to a given interval to the measured log ratios in that interval. If the method is applied on individual arrays having replicate spots, the method can calculate an overall width of the noise distribution which can be used as an indicator of the array quality.We compared this method with the fold change and unusual ratio method.We also discuss the relationship with an ANOVA model proposed by Churchillet al.In silicoexperiments were performed while controlling the degree of regulation as well as the amount of noise. Such experiments show the performance of the classical methods can be very unsatisfactory. We also compared the results of the 2-fold methodwith theresults of the noise sampling method using pre and post immortalization cell lines derived from the MDAH041 fibroblasts hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. The 2-fold method reported 198 genes as upregulated and 493 genes as downregulated. The noise sampling method reported 98 gene upregulated and 240 genes downregulated at the 99.99% confidence level. The methods agreed on 221 genes downregulated and 66 genes upregulated. Fourteen genes from the subset of genes reported by both methods were all confirmed byQ-RT-PCR. Alternative assays on various subsets of genes on which the two methods disagreed suggested that the noise sampling method is likelyto provide fewer false positives.Contact:sod@cs.wayne.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.†The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1348/220449/Noise-sampling-method-an-ANOVA-approach-allowing	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg165	NULL	http://sod@cs.wayne.edu	NULL	NULL

We have developed a simple procedure that integrates data filteringand normalization with quantitative quality control of microarray experiments.Previously we have shown that data variability in a microarray experiment can bevery well captured by a quality scoreqcomthat is defined for every spot, andthe ratio distribution depends onqcom. Utilizing this knowledge, our data-filtering scheme allows the investigator to decide on the filtering stringencyaccording to desired data variability, and our normalization procedure correctstheqcom-dependent dye biases in terms of both the location and the spread ofthe ratio distribution. In addition, we propose a statistical model for falsepositive rate determination based on the design and the quality of a microarrayexperiment. The model predicts that a lower limit of 0.5 for the replicateconcordance rate is needed in order to be certain of true positives.

of a class of nonparametric methods to detect
differential gene expression"	http://weip@biostat.umn.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	16	58	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Wei Pan	NULL	Motivation: Recently a class of nonparametric statistical methods, including the empirical Bayes (EB) method, the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method and the mixture model method (MMM),have been proposed to detect differential gene expression for replicated microarray experiments conducted under two conditions. All the methods depend on constructing a test statisticZand a so-called null statisticz. The null statisticzis used to provide some reference distribution forZsuch that statistical inference can be accomplished. A common way of constructingzis to applyZto randomly permuted data. Here we point our that the distribution ofzmay not approximate the null distribution ofZwell, leading to possibly too conservative inference. This observation may apply to other permutation-based nonparametric methods. We propose a new method of constructing a null statistic that aims to estimate the null distribution of a test statistic directly.Results: Using simulated data and real data,we assess and compare the performance of the existing method and our new method when applied in EB, SAM and MMM. Some interesting findings on operating characteristics of EB, SAM and MMM are also reported. Finally, by combining the idea of SAM and MMM, we outline a simple nonparametric method based on the direct use of a test statistic and a null statistic.Contact:weip@biostat.umn.edu	2003-07-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184491500005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/11/1333/220518/On-the-use-of-permutation-in-and-the-performance	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg167	NULL	http://weip@biostat.umn.edu	NULL	NULL

After the image analysis has been performed on amicroarray and before differentially expressed genes can be detected, someform of normalization must be applied to the microarrays. Normalizationremoves biases towards one or other of the fluorescent dyes used to labeleach mRNA sample allowing for proper evaluation of differential geneexpression.Results: The two normalization methods that we present here build onpreviously described non-linear normalization techniques.

Casavant	NULL	Motivation: High accuracy of data always governs the large-scale gene discovery projects.The data should not only be trustworthy but should be correctly annotatedfor various features it contains. Sequence errors are inherent in single-passsequences such as ESTs obtained from automated sequencing. These errorsfurther complicate the automated identification of EST-related sequencing.A tool is required to prepare the data prior to advanced annotation processing and submission to public databases.Results: This paper describesESTprep, a program designed to preprocess expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. It identifies the location of features present in ESTs and allows the sequence to pass only if it meets various quality criteria.

identifying specific probes for human and mouse genes"	http://konan@ibms.sinica.edu.tw	ORIGINAL PAPER	2	12	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Pei-chin Chang,Konan Peck	NULL	Motivation: Mammalian genomes are highly complex. To identify the unique sequences ofeach gene in a mammalian gene database containing tens of thousands of DNAsequences is a computation intensive task. With the advent of parallelgenetic analysis methods such as microarrays and the availability of moreand more whole genome sequences of organisms, an algorithm allowing speedyidentification of the unique gene probes for functional studies ofindividual genes will be a very useful tool.Results: We have developed a fast algorithm as well as a software program based onthe algorithm for identifying gene specific probes of complex organisms. Thealgorithm was applied to the assemblies of gene sequences and was highlyefficient for large databases such as the TIGR human THC and mouse TCdatabases. The results were assessed with the BLAST sequence alignmentsoftware. Two probe data sets have been compiled to contain specific probesfor around 100 000 putative human gene transcripts and 70 000 putative mousegene transcripts.Availability: The gene specific probes for the putative human and mouse genes referencedin the TIGR gene indices are available at:ftp://genestamp.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/pub/SpecificP/.

Bhandarkar	NULL	Motivation: Physical mapping of chromosomes using the maximumlikelihood (ML) model is a problem of high computational complexityentailing both discrete optimization to recover the optimal probe order aswell as continuous optimization to recover the optimal inter-probe spacings.In this paper, two versions of the genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed, onewith heuristic crossover and deterministic replacement and the other withheuristic crossover and stochastic replacement, for the physical mappingproblem under the maximum likelihood model. The genetic algorithms arecompared with two other discrete optimization approaches, namely simulatedannealing (SA) and large-step Markov chains (LSMC), in terms of solutionquality and runtime efficiency.Results: The physical mapping algorithms based on the GA, SA andLSMC have been tested using synthetic datasets and real datasets derivedfrom cosmid libraries of the fungusNeurospora crassa. The GA, especially the version withheuristic crossover and stochastic replacement, is shown to consistentlyoutperform the SA-based and LSMC-based physical mapping algorithms in termsof runtime and final solution quality. Experimental results on real datasetsand simulated datasets are presented.

to discriminate native from non-native protein conformations"	http://alex_tropsha@unc.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	14	76	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Bala Krishnamoorthy,Alexander Tropsha	NULL	Motivation: Most scoring functions used in protein fold recognition employ two-body (pseudo) potential energies. The use of higher-order terms mayimprove the performance of current algorithms.Methods: Proteins are represented by the side chain centroids of amino acids. Delaunay tessellation of this representation definesall sets of nearest neighbor quadruplets of amino acids. Four-body contact scoring function (log likelihoods of residue quadruplet compositions) is derived by the analysis of a diverse set of proteins with known structures.

comparison yield more accurate short seed alignments"	http://sadreyev@chop.swmed.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	11	45	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	David Mittelman,Ruslan Sadreyev,Nick Grishin	NULL	Motivation: The development of powerful automatic methods for thecomparison of protein sequences has become increasingly important.Profile-to-profile comparisons allow for the use of broader informationabout protein families, resulting in more sensitive and accurate comparisonsof distantly related sequences. A key part in the comparison of two profilesis the method for the calculation of scores for the position matches. Anumber of methods based on various theoretical considerations have beenproposed. We implemented several previously reported scoring functions aswell as our own functions, and compared them on the basis of their abilityto produce accurate short ungapped alignments of a given length.Results: Our results suggest that the family of the probabilisticmethods (log-odds based methods and prof_sim) may be the more appropriate choice for the generation of initial ‘seeds’ as the first step to producelocal profile–profile alignments. The most effective scoringsystems were the closely related modifications of functions previouslyimplemented in the COMPASS and Picasso methods.Contact:sadreyev@chop.swmed.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1531/257749/Probabilistic-scoring-measures-for-profile-profile	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg185	NULL	http://sadreyev@chop.swmed.edu	NULL	NULL
346	"Identification of functional links between genes using phylogenetic 
profiles"	http://delisi@bu.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	40	86	1	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jie Wu,Simon Kasif,Charles DeLisi	NULL	Motivation: Genes with identical patterns of occurrence across thephyla tend to function together in the same protein complexes or participatein the same biochemical pathway. However, the requirement that the profilesbe identical (i) severely restricts the number of functional links that canbe established by such phylogenetic profiling; (ii) limits detection to verystrong functional links, failing to capture relations between genes that arenot in the same pathway, but nevertheless subserve a common function and(iii) misses relations between analogous genes. Here we present and apply amethod for relaxing the restriction, based on the probability that a givenarbitrary degree of similarity between two profiles would occur by chance,with no biological pressure. Function is then inferred at any desired levelof confidence.Results: We derive an expression for the probability distributionof a given number of chance co-occurrences of a pair of non-homologousorthologs across a set of genomes. The method is applied to 2905 clustersof orthologous genes (COGs) from 44 fully sequenced microbial genomesrepresenting all three domains of life. Among the results are the following.(1) Of the 51 000 annotated intrapathway gene pairs, 8935 are linkedat a level of significance of 0.01. This is over 30-fold greater than the271 intrapathway pairs obtained at the same confidence level when identicalprofiles are used. (2) Of the 540 000 interpathway genes pairs, some 65 000are linked at the 0.01 level of significance, some 12 standarddeviations beyond the number expected by chance at this confidence level. Wespeculate that many of these links involve nearest-neighbor path, anddiscuss some examples. (3) The difference in the percentage of linkedinterpathway and intrapathway genes is highly significant, consistent withthe intuitive expectation that genes in the same pathway are generally undergreater selective pressure than those that are not. (4) The method appearsto recover well metabolic networks. This is illustrated by the TCA cyclewhich is recovered as a highly connected, weighted edge network of 30 of its31 COGs. (5) The fraction of pairs having a common pathway is a symmetricfunction of the Hamming distance between their profiles. This finding, thatthe functional correlation between profiles with near maximum Hammingdistance is as large as between profiles with near zero Hamming distance,and as statistically significant, is plausibly explained if the former grouprepresents analogous genes.Contact:delisi@bu.edu	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1524/257812/Identification-of-functional-links-between-genes	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg187	NULL	http://delisi@bu.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=11111111	NULL

Milinkovitch	NULL	Motivation: Progressive algorithms are widely used heuristics for the production of alignments among multiple nucleic-acid or protein sequences. Probabilistic approaches providing measures of global and/or local reliability of individual solutions would constitute valuable developments.Results: We present here a new method for multiple sequence alignment that combines an HMM approach, a progressive alignment algorithm, and a probabilistic evolution model describing the character substitution process. Our method works by iterating pairwise alignments according to a guide tree and defining each ancestral sequence from the pairwise alignment of its child nodes, thus, progressively constructing a multiple alignment. Our method allows for the computation of each column minimum posterior probability and we show that this value correlates with the correctness of the result, hence, providing an efficient mean by which unreliably aligned columns can be filtered out from a multiple alignment.Availability: The software is freely availablehttp://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ueg/Contact:aloytyno@ulb.ac.be;mcmilink@ulb.ac.be.*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1505/257958/A-hidden-Markov-model-for-progressive-multiple	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg193	NULL	http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ueg/,http://aloytyno@ulb.ac.be,http://mcmilink@ulb.ac.be	NULL	NULL

Unfortunately, these kinds of searches arecomputationally intensive and often represent bottlenecks in sequenceanalysis pipelines. Tuning parameters for speed can make the searches muchfaster, but one risks losing low-scoring alignments. However, high scoringalignments are relatively resistant to such changes in parameters, and thisfact makes it possible to use a serial strategy where a fast, insensitivesearch is used to pre-screen a database for similar sequences, and a slow,sensitive search is used to produce the sequence alignments.Results: Serial BLAST searches improve both the speed and sensitivity.Contact:ik1@sanger.ac.uk	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1492/258211/Serial-BLAST-searching	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg199	NULL	http://ik1@sanger.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

proteomics mass spectroscopy data: curses, caveats, cautions"	http://Ray.Somorjai@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca	ORIGINAL PAPER	58	179	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	R.L. Somorjai,B. Dolenko,R. Baumgartner	NULL	Motivation: Two practical realities constrain the analysis of microarray data, massspectra from proteomics, and biomedical infrared or magnetic resonancespectra. One is the ‘curse of dimensionality’: the number of features characterizing these datais in the thousands or tens of thousands. The other is the‘curse of dataset sparsity’: the numberof samples is limited. The consequences of these two curses are far-reachingwhen such data are used to classify the presence or absence of disease.Results: Using very simple classifiers, we show for several publicly availablemicroarray and proteomics datasets how these curses influence classificationoutcomes. In particular, even if thesample per feature ratiois increased to the recommended 5–10 byfeature extraction/reduction methods, dataset sparsity can render anyclassification result statistically suspect. In addition, several‘optimal’ feature sets are typically identifiable for sparse datasets,all producing perfect classification results, both for the training andindependent validation sets. This non-uniqueness leads to interpretationaldifficulties and casts doubt on the biological relevance of any of these‘optimal’ feature sets. We suggest an approach to assess the relativequality of apparently equally good classifiers.Contact:Ray.Somorjai@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1484/257690/Class-prediction-and-discovery-using-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg182	NULL	http://Ray.Somorjai@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca	NULL	NULL

high density oligonucleotide array data"	http://dilip.2.rajagopalan@gsk.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	83	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Dilip Rajagopalan	NULL	Motivation: Gene expression profiling has become an invaluable tool in functional genomics. A wide variety of statistical methods have been employed to analyze the data generated in experiments using Affymetrix GeneChip®microarrays. It is important to understand the relative performance of these methods in terms of accuracy in detecting and quantifying relative gene expression levels and changes in gene expression.Results: Three different analysis approaches have been compared in this work: non-parametric statistical methods implemented in Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite v5.0 (MAS5); an error-modeling based approach implemented in RosettaResolver®v3.1; and an intensity-modeling approach implemented in dChip v1.1.A Latin Square data set generated and made available by Affymetrix was used in the comparison.All three methods—Resolver, MAS5 and the version of dChip based on the difference between perfect match and mismatchintensities—perform well in quantifying gene expression. Presence calls made by MAS5 and Resolver perform well at high concentrations, but they cannot be relied upon at low concentrations. The performance of Resolver and MAS5 in detecting 2-fold changes in transcript concentration is superior to that of dChip.At a comparable false positive rate, Resolver and MAS5 are able to detect many more true changes in transcript concentration.Estimated fold changes calculated by all the methods are biased below the true values.Contact:dilip.2.rajagopalan@gsk.com	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1469/258333/A-comparison-of-statistical-methods-for-analysis	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg202	NULL	http://dilip.2.rajagopalan@gsk.com	NULL	NULL

Z. DeSantis,I. Dubosarskiy,S. R. Murray,G. L. Andersen	NULL	Motivation:Prokaryotic organisms have been identified utilizing the sequence variationof the 16S rRNA gene. Variations steer the design of DNA probes for thedetection of taxonomic groups or specific organisms. The long-term goal ofour project is to create probe arrays capable of identifying 16S rDNAsequences in unknown samples. This necessitated the authentication,categorization and alignment of the >75 000 publicly available‘ 16S’sequences. Preferably, the entire process should be computationallyadministrated so the aligned collection could periodically absorb 16S rDNAsequences from the public records. A complete multiple sequence alignmentwould provide a foundation for computational probe selection and facilitatesmicrobial taxonomy and phylogeny.Results: Here we report the alignment and similarity clustering of 62 662 16S rDNAsequences and an approach for designing effective probes for each cluster. Anovel alignment compression algorithm, NAST (Nearest Alignment SpaceTermination), was designed to produce the uniform multiple sequencealignment referred to as the prokMSA. From the prokMSA, 9020 OperationalTaxonomic Units (OTUs) were found based on transitive sequence similarities.An automated approach to probe design was straightforward using the prokMSAclustered into OTUs. As a test case, multiple probes were computationallypicked for each of the 27 OTUs that were identified within theStaphylococcus Group. The probes were incorporated into a customizedmicroarray and were able to correctly categorizeStaphylococcus aureusandBacillus anthracisinto their correctOTUs. Although a successful probe picking strategy is outlined, the mainfocus of creating the prokMSA was to provide a comprehensive, categorized,updateable 16S rDNA collection useful as a foundation for any probeselection algorithm.Availability:http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S/Contact:GLAndersen@lbl.govSupplementary Information: Complete prokMSA in aligned fasta format:http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S_cgi/download/update_28Dec02/prokMSA_aligned.fasta.ZSequences within each Operational Taxonomic Unit:http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S_cgi/download/update_15Mar02/SeqDescByOTU.txtDNA probe sequences:http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S_cgi/download/update_15Mar02/15Mar02_StaphGrpPrbs.xls*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-08-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000184878700002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1461/258250/Comprehensive-aligned-sequence-construction-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg200	NULL	http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S/,http://GLAndersen@lbl.gov,http://greengenes.llnl.gov/16S_cgi/download/update_15Mar02/SeqDescByOTU.txt	NULL	NULL

A number of information extraction systems for the biomedical domain have been reported, but none of them have become widely used in practical applications. Most proposals to date make rather simplistic assumptions about the syntactic aspect of natural language. There is an urgent need for a system that has broad coverage and performs well in real-text applications.Results:We present a general biomedical domain-oriented NLP engine called MedScan that efficiently processes sentences from MEDLINE abstracts and produces a set of regularized logical structures representing the meaning of each sentence. The engine utilizes a specially developed context-free grammar and lexicon. Preliminary evaluation of the system's performance, accuracy, and coverage exhibited encouraging results.

Shah	NULL	Motivation:Automated methods for biochemical pathway inference are becoming increasingly important for understanding biological processes in living and synthetic systems. With the availability of data on complete genomes and increasing information about enzyme-catalyzed biochemistry it is becoming feasible to approach this problem computationally. In this paper we present PathMiner, a system for automatic metabolic pathway inference. PathMiner predicts metabolic routes by reasoning over transformations using chemical and biological information.Results:We build a biochemical state-space using data from known enzyme-catalyzed transformations in Ligand, including, 2917 unique transformations between 3890 different compounds. To predict metabolic pathways we explore this state-space by developing an informed search algorithm. For this purpose we develop a chemically motivated heuristic to guide the search. Since the algorithm does not depend on predefined pathways, it can efficiently identify plausible routes using known biochemical transformations.Availability:The system is available for testing athttp://pathminer.uchsc.edu	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1692/224979/PathMiner-predicting-metabolic-pathways-by	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg217	NULL	http://imran.shah@uchsc.edu,http://pathminer.uchsc.edu	NULL	NULL

Comeau,S. Vajda,C.J. Camacho	NULL	Motivation:Even the best sequence alignment methods frequently fail to correctly identify the framework regions for which backbones can be copied from the template into the target structure. Since the underprediction and, more significantly, the overprediction of these regions reduces the quality of the final model, it is of prime importance to attain as much as possible of the true structural alignment between target and template.Results:We have developed an algorithm calledConsensusthat consistently provides a high quality alignment for comparative modeling. The method follows from a benchmark analysis of the 3D models generated by ten alignment techniques for a set of 79 homologous protein structure pairs. For 20-to-40% of the targets, these methods yield models with at least 6 Å root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the native structure. We have selected the top five performing methods, and developed a consensus algorithm to generate an improved alignment. By building on the individual strength of each method, a set of criteria was implemented to remove the alignment segments that are likely to correspond to structurally dissimilar regions. The automated algorithm was validated on a different set of 48 protein pairs, resulting in 2.2 Å average RMSD for the predicted models, and only four cases in which the RMSD exceeded 3 Å. The average length of the alignments was about 75% of that found by standard structural superposition methods. The performance ofConsensuswas consistent from 2 to 32% target–template sequence identity, and hence it can be used for accurate prediction of framework regions in homology modeling.Availability:The algorithm is available as a server athttp://structure.bu.edu/cgi-bin/consensus/consensus.cgi	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1682/224909/Consensus-alignment-for-reliable-framework	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg211	NULL	http://ccamacho@bu.edu,http://structure.bu.edu/cgi-bin/consensus/consensus.cgi	NULL	NULL
369	Comparison of sequence masking algorithms and the detection of biased protein sequence regions	http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dpk20/sup/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	5	11	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	David P. Kreil,Christos A. Ouzounis	NULL	Motivation:Separation of protein sequence regions according to their local information complexity and subsequent masking of low complexity regions has greatly enhanced the reliability of function prediction by sequence similarity. Comparisons with alternative methods that focus on compositional sequence bias rather than information complexity measures have shown that removal of compositional bias yields at least as sensitive and much more specific results. Besides the application of sequence masking algorithms to sequence similarity searches, the study of the masked regions themselves is of great interest. Traditionally, however, these have been neglected despite evidence of their functional relevance.Results:Here we demonstrate that compositional bias seems to be a more effective measure for the detection of biologically meaningful signals. Typical results on proteins are compared to results for sequences that have been randomized in various ways, conserving composition and local correlations for individual proteins or the entire set. It is remarkable that low-complexity regions have the same form of distribution in proteins as in randomized sequences, and that the signal from randomized sequences with conserved local correlations and amino acid composition almost matches the signal from proteins. This is not the case for sequence bias, which hence seems to be a genuinely biological phenomenon in contrast to patches of low complexity.Availability:Software in executable form is available on request from the authors.Supplementary information:There is an online supplement with additional supporting figures.

Mitchell,J.R. Reich,T.K. Attwood	NULL	Motivation:There have been several endeavours to address the problem of annotating sequence data computationally, but the task is non-trivial and few tools have emerged that gather useful information on a given sequence, or set of sequences, in a simple and convenient manner. As more genome projects bear fruit, the mass of uncharacterized sequence data accumulating in public repositories grows ever larger. There is thus a pressing need for tools to support the process of automatic analysis and annotation of newly determined sequences. With this in mind, we have developed PRECIS, which automatically creates protein reports from sets of SWISS-PROT entries, collating results into structured reports, detailing known biological and medical information, literature and database cross-references, and relevant keywords.Availability:The software is accessible online at:http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbbrowser/precis/blast_precis.cgi	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1664/224767/PRECIS-Protein-reports-engineered-from-concise	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg204	NULL	http://mitchell@ebi.ac.uk,http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbbrowser/precis/blast_precis.cgi	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Thus, computational prediction of subcellular locations from the amino acid sequence information would help annotation and functional prediction of protein coding genes in complete genomes. We have developed a method based on support vector machines (SVMs).Results:We considered 12 subcellular locations in eukaryotic cells: chloroplast, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular medium, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, and vacuole. We constructed a data set of proteins with known locations from the SWISS-PROT database. A set of SVMs was trained to predict the subcellular location of a given protein based on its amino acid, amino acid pair, and gapped amino acid pair compositions. The predictors based on these different compositions were then combined using a voting scheme. Results obtained through 5-fold cross-validation tests showed an improvement in prediction accuracy over the algorithm based on the amino acid composition only.

The SVM performs similarly to the 'state-of-the-art' PSIPRED prediction method on a non-homologous test set of 121 proteins despite being trained on substantially fewer examples.

373	An algorithm for constraint-based structural template matching: application to 3D templates with statistical analysis	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	39	129	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jonathan A. Barker,Janet M. Thornton	NULL	Motivation:Structural templates consisting of a few atoms in a specific geometric conformation provide a powerful tool for studying the relationship between protein structure and function. Current methods for template searching constrain template syntax and semantics by their design. Hence there is a need for a more flexible core algorithm upon which to build more sophisticated tools. Statistical analysis of structural similarity is still in its infancy when compared with its analogue in sequence alignment. In the context of template matching, there is an urgent need for normalization of scores so that results from templates with differing sensitivity may be compared directly.Results:We introduce Jess, a fast and flexible algorithm for searching protein structures for small groups of atoms under arbitrary constraints on geometry and chemistry. We apply the algorithm to a set of manually derived enzyme active site templates, and derive an empirical measure for estimating the relative significance of hits encountered using differing templates.Availability:Jess will be available in the near future under a restricted open source licence.	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1644/225114/An-algorithm-for-constraint-based-structural	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg226	NULL	http://jbarker@ebi.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Mass spectrometry (MS) holds great promise for biomarker identification and genome-wide protein profiling. It has been demonstrated in the literature that biomarkers can be identified to distinguish normal individuals from cancer patients using MS data. Such progress is especially exciting for the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer patients. Although various statistical methods have been utilized to identify biomarkers from MS data, there has been no systematic comparison among these approaches in their relative ability to analyze MS data.Results:We compare the performance of several classes of statistical methods for the classification of cancer based on MS spectra. These methods include: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis,k-nearest neighbor classifier, bagging and boosting classification trees, support vector machine, and random forest (RF). The methods are applied to ovarian cancer and control serum samples from the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program clinic at Northwestern University Hospital.

375	Statistical significance analysis of longitudinal gene expression data	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	56	20	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Xu Guo,Huilin Qi,Catherine M. Verfaillie,Wei Pan	NULL	Motivation:Time-course microarray experiments are designed to study biological processes in a temporal fashion. Longitudinal gene expression data arise when biological samples taken from the same subject at different time points are used to measure the gene expression levels. It has been observed that the gene expression patterns of samples of a given tumor measured at different time points are likely to be much more similar to each other than are the expression patterns of tumor samples of the same type taken from different subjects. In statistics, this phenomenon is called the within-subject correlation of repeated measurements on the same subject, and the resulting data are called longitudinal data. It is well known in other applications that valid statistical analyses have to appropriately take account of the possible within-subject correlation in longitudinal data.Results:We apply estimating equation techniques to construct a robust statistic, which is a variant of the robust Wald statistic and accounts for the potential within-subject correlation of longitudinal gene expression data, to detect genes with temporal changes in expression. We associate significance levels to the proposed statistic by either incorporating the idea of the significance analysis of microarrays method or using the mixture model method to identify significant genes. The utility of the statistic is demonstrated by applying it to an important study of osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation. Using simulated data, we also show pitfalls in drawing statistical inference when the within-subject correlation in longitudinal gene expression data is ignored.	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1628/224814/Statistical-significance-analysis-of-longitudinal	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg206	NULL	http://weip@biostat.umn.edu	NULL	NULL
376	The effect of replication on gene expression microarray experiments	http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/pavlidis/pub/gxrep	ORIGINAL PAPERS	29	100	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Paul Pavlidis,Qinghong Li,William Stafford Noble	NULL	Motivation:We examine the effect of replication on the detection of apparently differentially expressed genes in gene expression microarray experiments. Our analysis is based on a random sampling approach using real data sets from 16 published studies. We consider both the ability to find genes that meet particular statistical criteria as well as the stability of the results in the face of changing levels of replication.Results:While dependent on the data source, our findings suggest that stable results are typically not obtained until at least five biological replicates have been used. Conversely, for most studies, 10–15 replicates yield results that are quite stable, and there is less improvement in stability as the number of replicates is further increased. Our methods will be of use in evaluating existing data sets and in helping to design new studies.Supplementary information:http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/pavlidis/pub/gxrep	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1620/225130/The-effect-of-replication-on-gene-expression	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg227	NULL	http://pp175@columbia.edu,http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/pavlidis/pub/gxrep,http://www.gs.washington.edu/~noble/name-change.html	NULL	NULL
377	Diametrical clustering for identifying anti-correlated gene clusters	http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu	ORIGINAL PAPERS	8	51	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Inderjit S. Dhillon,Edward M. Marcotte,Usman Roshan	NULL	Motivation:Clustering genes based upon their expression patterns allows us to predict gene function. Most existing clustering algorithms cluster genes together when their expression patterns show high positive correlation. However, it has been observed that genes whose expression patterns are strongly anti-correlated can also be functionally similar. Biologically, this is not unintuitive—genes responding to the same stimuli, regardless of the nature of the response, are more likely to operate in the same pathways.Results:We present a newdiametrical clusteringalgorithm that explicitly identifies anti-correlated clusters of genes. Our algorithm proceeds by iteratively (i) re-partitioning the genes and (ii) computing the dominant singular vector of each gene cluster; each singular vector serving as the prototype of a 'diametric' cluster. We empirically show the effectiveness of the algorithm in identifying diametrical or anti-correlated clusters. Testing the algorithm on yeast cell cycle data, fibroblast gene expression data, and DNA microarray data from yeast mutants reveals that opposed cellular pathways can be discovered with this method. We present systems whose mRNA expression patterns, and likely their functions, oppose the yeast ribosome and proteosome, along with evidence for the inverse transcriptional regulation of a number of cellular systems.Availability:Seehttp://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edufor the experimental results.

No distinctive general features common to all ncRNA have yet been discovered. This makes it difficult to design computational tools able to detect novel ncRNAs in the genomic sequence.Results:We devised an algorithm able to detect conserved secondary structures in both pairwise and multiple DNA sequence alignments with computational time proportional to the square of the sequence length. We implemented the algorithm for the case of pairwise and three-way alignments and tested it on ncRNAs obtained from public databases. On the test sets, the pairwise algorithm has a specificity greater than 97% with a sensitivity varying from 22.26% for Blast alignments to 56.35% for structural alignments. The three-way algorithm behaves similarly. Our algorithm is able to efficiently detect a conserved secondary structure in multiple alignments.Availability:The executable file, the code and a PDF file containing the instructions, as well as the test data sets can be requested free of charge from the authors (dibernardo@tigem.it) or from the websitehttp://www.tigem.it/research/dibernardo/default.htm	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1606/225148/ddbRNA-detection-of-conserved-secondary-structures	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg229	NULL	http://dibernardo@tigem.it,http://dibernardo@tigem.it,http://www.tigem.it/research/dibernardo/default.htm	NULL	NULL
379	A comparative analysis of HGSC and Celera human genome assemblies and gene sets	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	18	5	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Shuyu Li,Gene Cutler,Jane Jijun Liu,Timothy Hoey,Liangbiao Chen,Peter G. Schultz,Jiayu Liao,Xuefeng Bruce Ling	NULL	Motivation:Since the simultaneous publication of the human genome assembly by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (HGSC) and Celera Genomics, several comparisons have been made of various aspects of these two assemblies. In this work, we set out to provide a more comprehensive comparative analysis of the two assemblies and their associated gene sets.Results:The local sequence content for both draft genome assemblies has been similar since the early releases, however it took a year for the quality of the Celera assembly to approach that of HGSC, suggesting an advantage of HGSC's hierarchical shotgun (HS) sequencing strategy over Celera's whole genome shotgun (WGS) approach. While similar numbers ofab initiopredicted genes can be derived from both assemblies, Celera's Otto approach consistently generated larger, more varied gene sets than the Ensembl gene build system. The presence of a non-overlapping gene set has persisted with successive data releases from both groups. Since most of the unique genes from either genome assembly could be mapped back to the other assembly, we conclude that the gene set discrepancies do not reflect differences in local sequence content but rather in the assemblies and especially the different gene-prediction methodologies.	2003-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185310600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1597/225014/A-comparative-analysis-of-HGSC-and-Celera-human	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg219	NULL	http://xling@tularik.com	NULL	NULL

389	The design of Jemboss: a graphical user interface to EMBOSS	http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/,http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Jemboss/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	26	63	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Tim Carver,Alan Bleasby	NULL	Design:Jemboss is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS). It is being developed at the MRC UK HGMP-RC as part of the EMBOSS project. This paper explains the technical aspects of the Jemboss client–server design. The client–server model optionally allows that a Jemboss user have an account on the remote server. The Jemboss client is written in Java and is downloaded automatically to a user's workstation via Java Web Start using the HTML protocol. The client then communicates with the remote server using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). A Tomcat server listens on the remote machine and communicates the SOAP requests to a Jemboss server, again written in Java. This Java server interprets the client requests and executes them through Java Native Interface (JNI) code written in the C language. Another C program having setuid privilege, jembossctl, is called by the JNI code to perform the client requests under the user's account on the server. The commands include execution of EMBOSS applications, file management and project management tasks. Jemboss allows the use of JSSE for encryption of communication between the client and server. The GUI parses the EMBOSS Ajax Command Definition language for form generation and maximum input flexibility. Jemboss interacts directly with the EMBOSS libraries to allow dynamic generation of application default settings.Results:This interface is part of the EMBOSS distribution and has attracted much interest. It has been set up at many other sites globally as well as being used at the HGMP-RC for registered users.Availability:The software, EMBOSS and Jemboss, is freely available to academics and commercial users under the GPL licence.

Galinsky	NULL	Motivation:In the first part of this paper the author presented an efficient, robust and completely automated algorithm for spot and block indexing in microarray images with rectangular grids. Although the rectangular grid is currently the most common type of grouping the probes on microarray slides, there is another microarray technology based on bundles of optical fibers where the probes are packed in hexagonal grids. The hexagonal grid provides both advantages and drawbacks over the standard rectangular packing and of course requires adaptation and/or modification of the algorithm of spot indexing presented in the first part of the paper.Results:In the second part of the paper the author presents a version of the spot indexing algorithm adapted for microarray images with spots packed in hexagonal structures. The algorithm is completely automated, works with hexagonal grids of different types and with different parameters of grid spacing and rotation as well as spot sizes. It can successfully trace the local and global distortions of the grid, including non-orthogonal transformations. Similar to the algorithm from part I, it scales linearly with the grid size, the time complexity is O(M), whereMis total number of grid points in hexagonal grid. The algorithm has been tested both on CCD and scanned images with spot expression rates as low as 2%. The processing time of an image with about 50 000 hex grid points was less than a second.

392	Transformation and normalization of oligonucleotide microarray data	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	18	43	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Sue C. Geller,Jeff P. Gregg,Paul Hagerman,David M. Rocke	NULL	Motivation:Most methods of analyzing microarray data or doing power calculations have an underlying assumption of constant variance across all levels of gene expression. The most common transformation, the logarithm, results in data that have constant variance at high levels but not at low levels. Rocke and Durbin showed that data from spotted arrays fit a two-component model and Durbin, Hardin, Hawkins, and Rocke, Huberet al. and Munson provided a transformation that stabilizes the variance as well as symmetrizes and normalizes the error structure. We wish to evaluate the applicability of this transformation to the error structure of GeneChip microarrays.Results:We demonstrate in an example study a simple way to use the two-component model of Rocke and Durbin and the data transformation of Durbin, Hardin, Hawkins and Rocke, Huberet al. and Munson on Affymetrix GeneChip data. In addition we provide a method for normalization of Affymetrix GeneChips simultaneous with the determination of the transformation, producing a data set without chip or slide effects but with constant variance and with symmetric errors. This transformation/normalization process can be thought of as a machine calibration in that it requires a few biologically constant replicates of one sample to determine the constant needed to specify the transformation and normalize. It is hypothesized that this constant needs to be found only once for a given technology in a lab, perhaps with periodic updates. It does not require extensive replication in each study. Furthermore, the variance of the transformed pilot data can be used to do power calculations using standard power analysis programs.Availability:SPLUS code for the transformation/normalization for four replicates is available from the first author upon request.

393	Controlling false-negative errors in microarray differential expression analysis: a PRIM approach	http://microarray.crump.ucla.edu/focus	ORIGINAL PAPERS	17	66	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Steve W. Cole,Zoran Galic,Jerome A. Zack	NULL	Motivation:Theoretical considerations suggest that current microarray screening algorithms may fail to detect many true differences in gene expression (Type II analytic errors). We assessed ‘false negative’ error rates in differential expression analyses by conventional linear statistical models (e.g.t-test), microarray-adapted variants (e.g. SAM, Cyber-T), and a novel strategy based on hold-out cross-validation. The latter approach employs the machine-learning algorithm Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to infer minimum thresholds for reliable change in gene expression from Boolean conjunctions of fold-induction and raw fluorescence measurements.Results:Monte Carlo analyses based on four empirical data sets show that conventional statistical models and their microarray-adapted variants overlook more than 50% of genes showing significant up-regulation. Conjoint PRIM prediction rules recover approximately twice as many differentially expressed transcripts while maintaining strong control over false-positive (Type I) errors. As a result, experimental replication rates increase and total analytic error rates decline. RT-PCR studies confirm that gene inductions detected by PRIM but overlooked by other methods represent true changes in mRNA levels. PRIM-based conjoint inference rules thus represent an improved strategy for high-sensitivity screening of DNA microarrays.Availability:Freestanding JAVA application athttp://microarray.crump.ucla.edu/focus	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1808/245894/Controlling-false-negative-errors-in-microarray	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg242	NULL	http://coles@ucla.edu,http://microarray.crump.ucla.edu/focus	NULL	NULL

Yearwood	NULL	Motivation:The increasing use of DNA microarray-based tumor gene expression profiles for cancer diagnosis requires mathematical methods with high accuracy for solving clustering, feature selection and classification problems of gene expression data.Results:New algorithms are developed for solving clustering, feature selection and classification problems of gene expression data. The clustering algorithm is based on optimization techniques and allows the calculation of clusters step-by-step. This approach allows us to find as many clusters as a data set contains with respect to some tolerance. Feature selection is crucial for a gene expression database. Our feature selection algorithm is based on calculating overlaps of different genes. The database used, contains over 16 000 genes and this number is considerably reduced by feature selection. We propose a classification algorithm where each tissue sample is considered as the center of a cluster which is a ball. The results of numerical experiments confirm that the classification algorithm in combination with the feature selection algorithm perform slightly better than the published results for multi-class classifiers based on support vector machines for this data set.Availability:Available on request from the authors.	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1800/245826/New-algorithms-for-multi-class-cancer-diagnosis	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg238	NULL	http://a.bagirov@ballarat.edu.au	NULL	NULL

Their applications range from functional annotation to tissue classification and genetic network inference. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. This translates to the algorithmic problem of clustering genes based on their expression patterns.Results:We present a novel clustering algorithm, called CLICK, and its applications to gene expression analysis. The algorithm utilizes graph-theoretic and statistical techniques to identify tight groups (kernels) of highly similar elements, which are likely to belong to the same true cluster. Several heuristic procedures are then used to expand the kernels into the full clusters. We report on the application of CLICK to a variety of gene expression data sets. In all those applications it outperformed extant algorithms according to several common figures of merit. We also point out that CLICK can be successfully used for the identification of common regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of co-regulated genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CLICK can be used to accurately classify tissue samples into disease types, based on their expression profiles. Finally, we present a new java-based graphical tool, called EXPANDER, for gene expression analysis and visualization, which incorporates CLICK and several other popular clustering algorithms.Availability:http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~rshamir/expander/expander.html	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1787/245773/CLICK-and-EXPANDER-a-system-for-clustering-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg232	NULL	http://roded@icsi.berkeley.edu,http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~rshamir/expander/expander.html	NULL	NULL

In particular, this makes possible the study of the spatial distribution of disease-related genes within the genome.

We compute the spatial autocorrelation function of the selected genes and find that they tend to cluster over scales of a few megabase pairs. We then identify significant gene clusters using a friends-of-friends algorithm.

They can be classified into two groups: (1)AIB methodsthatassumeindependent contributions of all peptide positions to thebinding to MHC-I molecule (e.g. scoring matrices) and (2)general methodswhich can take into account interactions between different positions (e.g. artificial neural networks). We aim to compare the prediction accuracies of these methods, and quantify the impact of interactions between peptide positions.Results:We compared several previously published and widely used methods and discovered that the best AIB methods gave significantly better predictions than three previously published general methods, possibly due to the lack of a sufficient training data for the general methods. The best results, however, were achieved with our newly developed general method, which combined a matrix describing independent binding with pair coefficients describing pair-wise interactions between peptide positions. The pair coefficients consistently but only slightly improved prediction accuracy, and were much smaller than the matrix entries. This explains why neglecting them—as is done in AIB methods—can still lead to good predictions.Availability:The new prediction model is implemented athttp://zlab.bu.edu/SMM.

Vinayagam,J. Shi,G. Pugalenthi,B. Meenakshi,T.L. Blundell,R. Sowdhamini	NULL	Motivation:Although many methods are available for the identification of structural domains from protein three-dimensional structures, accurate definition of protein domains and the curation of such data for a large number of proteins are often possible only after manual intervention. The availability of domain definitions for protein structural entries is useful for the sequence analysis of aligned domains, structure comparison, fold recognition procedures and understanding protein folding, domain stability and flexibility.Results:We have improved our method of domain identification starting from the concept of clustering secondary structural elements, but with an intention of reducing the number of discontinuous segments in identified domains. The results of our modified and automatic approach have been compared with the domain definitions from other databases. On a test data set of 55 proteins, this method acquires high agreement (88%) in the number of domains with the crystallographers' definition and resources such as SCOP, CATH, DALI, 3Dee and PDP databases. This method also obtains 98% overlap score with the other resources in the definition of domain boundaries of the 55 proteins.

400	Recognizing the fold of a protein structure	http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cath/Grath.pl	ORIGINAL PAPERS	11	54	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Andrew Harrison,Frances Pearl,Ian Sillitoe,Tim Slidel,Richard Mott,Janet Thornton,Christine Orengo	NULL	This paper reports a graph-theoretic program, GRATH, that rapidly, and accurately, matches a novel structure against a library of domain structures to find the most similar ones. GRATH generates distributions of scores by comparing the novel domain against the different types of folds that have been classified previously in the CATH database of structural domains.GRATH uses a measure of similarity that details the geometric information, number of secondary structures and number of residues within secondary structures, that any two protein structures share. Although GRATH builds on well established approaches for secondary structure comparison, a novel scoring scheme has been introduced to allow ranking of any matches identified by the algorithm. More importantly, we have benchmarked the algorithm using a large dataset of 1702 non-redundant structures from the CATH database which have already been classified into fold groups, with manual validation. This has facilitated introduction of further constraints, optimization of parameters and identification of reliable thresholds for fold identification. Following these benchmarking trials, the correct fold can be identified with the top score with a frequency of 90%. It is identified within the ten most likely assignments with a frequency of 98%.GRATH has been implemented to use via a server (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cath/Grath.pl). GRATH's speed and accuracy means that it can be used as a reliable front-end filter for the more accurate, but computationally expensive, residue based structure comparison algorithm SSAP, currently used to classify domain structures in the CATH database. With an increasing number of structures being solved by the structural genomics initiatives, the GRATH server also provides an essential resource for determining whether newly determined structures are related to any known structures from which functional properties may be inferred.	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1748/245859/Recognizing-the-fold-of-a-protein-structure	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg240	NULL	http://harry@biochem.ucl.ac.uk,http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cath/Grath.pl	NULL	NULL

Charles Hodgman,Zheng Rong Yang,Austin K. Doyle	NULL	Motivation:In protein chemistry, proteomics and biopharmaceutical development, there is a desire to know not only where a protein is cleaved by a protease, but also the susceptibility of its cleavage sites. The current tools for proteolytic cleavage prediction have often relied purely on regular expressions, or involve models that do not represent biological data well.Results:A novel methodology for characterizing proteolytic cleavage site activities has been developed, which incorporates two fundamental features: activity class prediction and the use of an amino acid similarity matrix for (non-parametric) neural learning. The first solved the problem of predicting proteolytic efficiency. The second significantly improved the robustness in prediction and reduced the time complexity for learning. This study shows that activity class prediction is successful when applying this methodology to the prediction and characterization of Trypsin cleavage sites and the prediction of HIV protease cleavage sites.Availability:Requests for software and data should be made respectively to Dr Zheng Rong Yang and Miss Rebecca Thomson.	2003-09-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000185701100003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/14/1741/245813/Characterizing-proteolytic-cleavage-site-activity	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg237	NULL	http://Z.R.Yang@ex.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

  genomic data"	http://ron@biocom1.ls.biu.ac.il	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yair Horesh,Amihood Amir,Shulamit Michaeli,Ron Unger	NULL	RNAi, inhibition of gene expression by double stranded RNAmolecules, has rapidly become a powerful laboratory technique tostudy gene function. The effectiveness of the procedure raised thequestion of whether this laboratory technique may actually mimic anatural cellular control mechanism that works on similar principles.Indeed recent evidence is accumulating to suggest that RNAi is anatural control mechanism that might even serve as a primitive immuneresponse against RNA viruses and retroposons. Three differentinterference scenarios seem to be utilized by various RNAimechanisms. One of the mechanisms involves degradation of mRNAmolecules. Here we suggest a method to systematically scan entiregenomes simultaneously for RNAi elements and the presence of cellulargenes that are degraded by these RNAi elements via exact shortbase-pair matching. The method is based on scanning the genomes usinga suffix tree data structure that was specifically modified toidentify sets of combinations of repeated and inverted repeatedsequences of 20 bp or more. Initial scan suggest that a large number,about 7% of C.elegans and 3% of C.briggsae genes, have the potentialto be subject to natural RNAi control. Two methods are proposed tofurther analyze these genes to select the cases that are more likelyto be actual cases of RNAi control. One method involves looking forESTs that can provide direct evidence that RNAi control element areindeed expressed. The other method looks for synteny betweenC.elegans and C.briggsae assuming that genes that might be under RNAicontrol in both organisms are more likely to be biologicalsignificant. Taken together, supportive evidence was found for about70 genes to be under RNAi control. Among these genes are:transposase, hormone receptors, homeobox proteins, defensin, actins,and several types of collagens. While our method is not capable ofdetecting all cases of natural RNAi control, it points to a largenumber of potential cases that can be further verified byexperimental work.Key words: RNAi, Suffix tree, C.elegans,C.briggsae, control mechanismContact:ron@biocom1.ls.biu.ac.il*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii73/180274/A-rapid-method-for-detection-of-putative-RNAi	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1063	NULL	http://ron@biocom1.ls.biu.ac.il	NULL	NULL

A simple ‘partition’ bound is introduced forgeneral models. Tighter bounds are developed for the simplest modelof evolution, the two state symmetric model of nucleotidesubstitution under the molecular clock. This follows earliertheoretical work which has been restricted to this model by analyticcomplexity. A weakness of current numerical computation is thatreported ‘maximum likelihood’ results cannot beguaranteed, both for a specified tree (because of the possibility ofmultiple maxima) or over the full tree space (as the computation isintractable for large sets of trees). The bounds we develop here canbe used to conclusively eliminate large proportions of tree space inthe search for the maximum likelihood tree. This is vital in thedevelopment of a branch and bound search strategy for identifying themaximum likelihood tree. We report the results from a simulationstudy of approximately 106data sets generated onclock-like trees of five leaves. In each trial a likelihood value ofone specific instance of a parameterised tree is compared to thebound determined for each of the 105 possible rooted binary trees.The proportion of trees that are eliminated from the search for themaximum likelihood tree ranged from 92% to almost 98%, indicating acomputational speed–up factor of between 12 and 44.Contact:m.hendy@massey.ac.nz*Towhom correspondence should be addressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii66/180260/Upper-bounds-on-maximum-likelihood-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1062	NULL	http://m.hendy@massey.ac.nz	NULL	NULL

Most of the existingmethods assume that protein-protein interaction data are given asbinary data (i.e. whether or not each protein pair interacts).However, multiple biological experiments are performed for the sameprotein pairs and thus the ratio (strength) of the number ofobserved interactions to the number of experiments is available foreach protein pair.Results: We propose a new method for inference of protein-proteininteractions from such experimental data. This method tries tominimize the errors between the ratios of observed interactions andthe predicted probabilities in training data, where this problem isformalized as a linear program based on a probabilistic model. Wecompared the proposed method with the association method, the EMmethod and the SVM-based method using real interaction data. It isshown that a variant of the method is comparable to existing methodsfor binary data.

A major computationalchallenge is finding ways to extract new biological understandingfrom this wealth of data. Our goal is to uncover the causal structureof the interactions between genes, with the aim of understanding theregulatory processes that bring about the observed expressionpatterns. I will argue that one way of addressing this question is aBayesian framework, where we treat the measured expression level ofeach gene as a random variable and each regulatory interaction as aprobabilistic dependency between such variables. In my talk, I willdescribe an ongoing project to use Bayesian networks and extensionsof them to model such dependencies.In the talk I will explainthe basic foundations of the approach, the possible choices indefining the modeling language, the methods we use to learn modelsfrom data, and finally how we interpret the learned models. Thislatter stage includes validation against known biology, andconstructing new hypotheses about the role of unknown genes.Iwill present a progression of models that capture different aspect ofgene regulation, and an assessment of their performance on severallarge scale yeast gene expression experiments.This is jointwork with Dana Pe’er, Iftach Nachman, Aviv Regev, Gal Elidan, Eran Segel, Micha Shapira, David Botstein, and Daphne Koller.Contact:nir@cs.huji.ac.il.http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nir	2003-09-27	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f19%2fsuppl_2%2fii57%2f180232	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii57/180232/Probabilistic-models-for-identifying-regulation	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1060	NULL	http://nir@cs.huji.ac.il,http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nir	NULL	NULL

Vingron	NULL	Many cellular signaling pathways induce gene expression byactivating specific transcription factor complexes. Conventionalapproaches to the prediction of transcription factor binding siteslead to a notoriously high number of false discoveries. To alleviatethis problem, we consider only binding sites that are conserved inman-mouse genomic sequence comparisons. We employ two alternativemethods for predicting binding sites: exact matches to validatedbinding site sequences and weight matrix scans. We then ask thequestion whether there is a characteristic association between atranscription factor or set thereof to a particular group of genes.Our approach is tested on genes, which are induced in dendritic cellsin response to the cells’ exposure to LPS. We chose thisexample because the underlying signaling pathways are wellunderstood. We demonstrate the benefit of conserved predicted bindingsites in interpreting the LPS experiment. Additionally, we find thatboth methods for the prediction of conserved binding sites complementone another. Finally, our results suggest a distinct role for SRF inthe context of LPS-induced gene expression.Contact:christoph.dieterich@molgen.mpg.de*To whom correspondence should be addressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii50/180210/Exploring-potential-target-genes-of-signaling	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1059	NULL	http://christoph.dieterich@molgen.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

By integrating multiple signals, CRMsconfer an organism specific spatial and temporal rate oftranscription.Results: Based on the hypothesis that genes that are needed inexactly the same conditions might share similar regulatory switches,we have developed a novel methodology to find CRMs in a set ofcoexpressed or coregulated genes. The ModuleSearcher algorithm findsfor a given gene set the best scoring combination of transcriptionfactor binding sites within a sequence window using anA*procedure for tree searching. To keep the levelof noise low, we use DNA sequences that are most likely to containfunctionalcis-regulatory information, namely conservedregions between human and mouse orthologous genes. The ModuleScannerperforms genomic searches with a predicted CRM or with auser-defined CRM known from the literature to find possible targetgenes. The validity of a set of putative targets is checked usingGene Ontology annotations. We demonstrate the use and effectivenessof the ModuleSearcher and ModuleScanner algorithms and test theirspecificity and sensitivity on semi-artificial data. Next, we searchfor a module in a cluster of gene expression profiles of human cellcycle genes.Availability: The ModuleSearcher is available as a web servicewithin the TOUCAN workbench for regulatory sequence analysis, whichcan be downloaded fromhttp://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~dna/BioI.Contact:stein.aerts@esat.kuleuven.ac.be*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii5/180082/Computational-detection-of-cis-regulatory-modules	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1052	NULL	http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~dna/BioI,http://stein.aerts@esat.kuleuven.ac.be	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

  splicing"	http://lpachter@math.berkeley.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	37	11	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Simon L. Cawley,Lior Pachter	NULL	The standard method of applying hidden Markov models tobiological problems is to find a Viterbi (maximal weight) paththrough the HMM graph. The Viterbi algorithm reduces the problem offinding the most likely hidden state sequence that explains givenobservations, to a dynamic programming problem for correspondingdirected acyclic graphs. For example, in the gene findingapplication, the HMM is used to find the most likely underlying genestructure given a DNA sequence. In this note we discuss theapplications of sampling methods for HMMs. The standard samplingalgorithm for HMMs is a variant of the common forward-backward andbacktrack algorithms, and has already been applied in the context ofGibbs sampling methods. Nevetheless, the practice of sampling statepaths from HMMs does not seem to have been widely adopted, andimportant applications have been overlooked. We show how sampling canbe used for finding alternative splicings for genes, includingalternative splicings that are conserved between genes from relatedorganisms. We also show how sampling from the posterior distributionis a natural way to compute probabilities for predicted exons andgene structures being correct under the assumed model. Finally, wedescribe a new memory efficient sampling algorithm for certainclasses of HMMs which provides a practicalsamplingalternative to the Hirschberg algorithm for optimal alignment. Theideas presented have applications not only to gene finding and HMMsbut more generally to stochastic context free grammars and RNAstructure prediction.Key words: suboptimal parses, sampling,hidden Markov model, conserved alternative splicingContact:lpachter@math.berkeley.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii36/180171/HMM-sampling-and-applications-to-gene-finding-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1057	NULL	http://lpachter@math.berkeley.edu	NULL	NULL

  genomes?"	http://www-ifi.uni-muenster.de/exapted-retrogenes/tables.html),http://RNA.world@uni-muenster.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	3	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jürgen Brosius	NULL	Conversion of genetic information from RNA into DNA byreverse transcription is ancient and was instrumental for thetransition from the RNP world to modern cells (Brosius, 1999a,Nat. Genet.,22, 8–9; Brosius, 2003,J.Struct. Funct. Genom.,3, 1–17). Surprisingly, inmany eukaryotic lineages, the process of retroposition is still veryactive. All types of RNAs (Brosius, 1999b,Gene,238, 115–134) can be reverse transcribed and their cDNAcopies reintegrated into genomes as retronuons (a nuon is anydiscrete segment of nucleic acid (Brosius and Gould, 1992,Proc.Natl Acad. Sci. USA,89, 10706–10710)). About 38%or 42% of the mouse and human genomes, respectively, consist ofdiscernible retronuons (excluding mRNA-derived retroposons). Only1.5% of the human genome consists of exons coding for proteins. Evenconsidering DNA transposons (∼1–3% discernible),slippage during replication and a relatively large fraction derivedfrom segmental duplications it is conceivable that the remainder ofmammalian genomes is probably derived from ancient, todaynon-discernible retronuons. Hence, the vast majority of mammaliangenomes have been contributed by retroposition. Retropositionpredominantly leads to ‘junk DNA’. However, mRNA-derivedretronuons are known to give rise to active genes, often withdifferent expression patterns than their respective founder genes(Brosius and Gould, 1992,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA,89, 10706–10710; Brosius, 1991,Science,251, 753). Retronuons derived from small non-messenger RNAs(snmRNAs) generate novel snmRNA genes (such as the neuron-specificBC1 and BC200 RNAs) (Brosius, 1999b,Gene,238,115–134; Brosius and Gould, 1992,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.USA,89, 10706–10710). Frequently, retronuons areexapted (co-opted) as regulatory elements that may alter expressionor processing of targeted genes (Brosius and Gould, 1992,Proc.Natl Acad. Sci. USA,89, 10706–10710) (forcompilations seehttp://www-ifi.uni-muenster.de/exapted-retrogenes/tables.html).Consequently, retronuons are a major driving force of evolution andperhaps even speciation. Comparison of the human genome with that ofother mammals such as mouse or, in particular, chimpanzee revealsthat neither contains numerous additional genes. Instead, oneobserves exaptation of novel exons (often involving alternativesplicing) from previously nonaptive intronic (as predicted byGilbert, 1978,Nature,271, 501) or flankingsequences originally generated by retroposition. Furthermore, thedifferential expression of shared genes with respect to developmentalonset and/or cell-type specificity, that is triggered bydenovoinsertions of retronuons, will turn out to be a recurrenttheme in species differences at the genomic level.Contact:RNA.worldwuni-muenster.de	2003-09-27	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f19%2fsuppl_2%2fii35%2f180158	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii35/180158/How-significant-is-98-5-junk-in-mammalian-genomes	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1056	NULL	http://www-ifi.uni-muenster.de/exapted-retrogenes/tables.html),http://RNA.world@uni-muenster.de	NULL	NULL

It is very clear thatthe similarity of the biology of different Plasmodium species isreflected in the largely conserved organisation of their genomes. Thedifferences between the parasite genomes are most obviously confinedto the sub-telomeric regions where the multigene families that areinvolved in antigenic variation are located. Comparitive genomics mayhelp improve the annotation of the conserved more centromeric regionsof the prototype Plasmodium genome and pinpoint genes under stringentselection or experiencing rapid drift. Detailed comparison ofPlasmodium genomes can catalogue genome recombination, gene groupingand perhaps indicate higher order levels of genome structure. Thesignificant conservation of gene content including genes that encodesurface proteins involved in cell-cell interactions means that themore extensive repertoire of experimental possibilities afforded bymodel parasites can be exploited to provide biological insights thatremain relevant to drug and vaccine research.

When estimating anetwork from gene expression data alone, a common problem is that thenumber of microarrays is limited compared to the number of variablesin the network model, making accurate estimation a difficult task.Our method overcomes this problem by integrating the microarray geneexpression data and the DNA sequence information into a Bayesiannetwork model. The basic idea of our method is that, if a parent geneis a transcription factor, its children may share a consensus motifin their promoter regions of the DNA sequences.

The molecularmechanisms for these events have been described in laboratoryexperiments and sometimes even under ‘naturalconditions’. Beside, when put in different environments, agiven bacterial genome shows drastic change in its profile ofexpression (as evidenced by transcriptomic or proteomic experiments).Thus, clearly genetic differences and variation in environmentalconditions lead to phenotypic variability (i.e. as text books saygenotype X environment = phenotype). However, there might beother sources of phenotypic variability as experiments show that evenwith a given genome in a given environment one observes phenotypicvariability. Even if this was recognized already in the 50’s,the causes and consequences of this other source of phenotypicvariability remain to be described presumably by developping newinterdisciplinary tools.Contact:taddei@necker.fr	2003-09-27	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f19%2fsuppl_2%2fii226%2f180623	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii226/180623/Sources-of-genetic-and-phenotypic-variability	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1081	NULL	http://taddei@necker.fr	NULL	NULL

Adegenerate pattern over a finite alphabet Σ is asequence of subsets of Σ. A string over IUPAC nucleicacid codes is also a degenerate pattern over Σ = {A, C, G,T}, and is used as one of the major patterns modelingtranscription factor binding sites in the upstream regions of genes.However, it is known that the problem of finding a degeneratepattern consistent with both positive and negative string sets is ingeneral NP-complete. Our aim is to devise a heuristic algorithm tofind a degenerate pattern which isoptimalfor positive and negativestring sets w.r.t. a given score function.Results: We have proposed an enumerative algorithm calledSUPERPOSITION for finding optimal degenerate patterns with a pruningtechnique, which works with most all reasonable score functions.

Because handling noise in microarray data presentssimilar challenges, we have adapted this strategy to thebiclustering of discretized microarray data.Results: In contrast with standard clustering that reveals genesthat behave similarly over all the conditions, biclustering groupsgenes over only a subset of conditions for which those genes have asharp probability distribution. We have opted for a simpleprobabilistic model of the biclusters because it has the keyadvantage of providing a transparent probabilistic interpretation ofthe biclusters in the form of an easily interpretable fingerprint.Furthermore, Gibbs sampling does not suffer from the problem oflocal minima that often characterizesExpectation–Maximization.

In biology, where structuresor processes are described by a large number of features, theelimination of irrelevant and redundant information in a reasonableamount of time has a number of advantages. It enables theclassification system to achieve good or even better solutions witha restricted subset of features, allows for a faster classification,and it helps the human expert focus on a relevant subset offeatures, hence providing useful biological knowledge.Results: We present a heuristic method based on Estimation ofDistribution Algorithms to select relevant subsets of features forsplice site prediction inArabidopsis thaliana. We showthat this method performs a fast detection of relevant featuresubsets using the technique of constrained feature subsets. Comparedto the traditional greedy methods the gain in speed can be up to oneorder of magnitude, with results being comparable or even betterthan the greedy methods.

Bailey,William Stafford Noble	NULL	Motivation: The regulatory machinery controlling gene expressionis complex, frequently requiring multiple, simultaneous DNA-proteininteractions. The rate at which a gene is transcribed may dependupon the presence or absence of a collection of transcriptionfactors bound to the DNA near the gene. Locating transcriptionfactor binding sites in genomic DNA is difficult because theindividual sites are small and tend to occur frequently by chance.True binding sites may be identified by their tendency to occur inclusters, sometimes known as regulatory modules.Results: We describe an algorithm for detecting occurrences ofregulatory modules in genomic DNA. The algorithm, called mcast,takes as input a DNA database and a collection of binding sitemotifs that are known to operate in concert. mcast uses amotif-based hidden Markov model with several novel features. Themodel incorporates motif-specificp-values, thereby allowingscores from motifs of different widths and specificities to becompared directly. Thep-value scoring also allows mcast toonly accept motif occurrences with significance below auser-specified threshold, while still assigning better scores tomotif occurrences with lowerp-values. mcast can search longDNA sequences, modeling length distributions between motifs within aregulatory module, but ignoring length distributions betweenmodules. The algorithm produces a list of predicted regulatorymodules, ranked byE-value.

Selection pressures related to efficient synthesis, ratherthan proper function, of proteins may act globally on the amino acidcomposition of the proteome, but are less firmly established. Asubstantial fraction of bacterial energy budgets are devoted tobiosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Thefueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolitesfor synthesis of amino acids. Thus, synthesis of an amino acidentails a dual cost; energy is lost by diverting chemicalintermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy isrequired to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Selectionto reduce the energetic costs predicts increases in the abundance ofless energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.Using synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates,we show that amino acid composition in the proteomes ofEscherichia coliandBacillus subtilisreflects theaction of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. Theprimary structures of proteins may also reflect natural selection toenhance the rate and accuracy of their synthesis. Differences incellular concentrations of tRNAs could lead to translation selectionboth within and among synonymous families. In yeast, usage of severalamino acids show striking associations with gene expression. Thesechanges in amino acid composition result in stronger correlationsbetween amino acid usage and tRNA abundances in highly expressedgenes than in less expressed loci.

  post-translational modifications"	http://hto-c.usc.edu:8000/msms/suffix/,http://tingchen@hto.usc.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	11	9	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Bingwen Lu,Ting Chen	NULL	Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry combined with sequencedatabase searching is one of the most powerful tools for proteinidentification. As thousands of spectra are generated by a massspectrometer in one hour, the speed of database searching iscritical, especially when searching against a large sequencedatabase, or when the peptide is generated by some unknown ornon-specific enzyme, even or when the target peptides havepost-translational modifications (PTM). In practice, about70–90% of the spectra have no match in the database. Manybelieve that a significant portion of them are due to peptides ofnon-specific digestions by unknown enzymes or amino acidmodifications. In another case, scientists may choose to use somenon-specific enzymes such as pepsin or thermolysin for proteolysisin proteomic study, in that not all proteins are amenable to bedigested by some site-specific enzymes, and furthermore manydigested peptides may not fall within the rang of molecular weightsuitable for mass spectrometry analysis. Interpretating mass spectraof these kinds will cost a lot of computational time of databasesearch engines.Overview: The present study was designed tospeed up the database searching process for both cases. Morespecifically speaking, we employed an approach combining suffix treedata structure and spectrum graph. The suffix tree is used topreprocess the protein sequence database, while the spectrum graphis used to preprocess the tandem mass spectrum. We then search thesuffix tree against the spectrum graph for candidate peptides. Wedesign an efficient algorithm to compute a matching threshold withsome statistical significance level, e.g.p= 0.01, for eachspectrum, and use it to select candidate peptides. Then we rankthese peptides using a SEQUEST-like scoring function. The algorithmswere implemented and tested on experimental data. Forpost-translational modifications, we allow arbitrary number of anymodification to a protein.Availability: The executable program and other supplementarymaterials are available online at:http://hto-c.usc.edu:8000/msms/suffix/.Contact:tingchen@hto.usc.edu*Towhom correspondence should be addressed.	2003-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000207434300014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_2/ii113/180382/A-suffix-tree-approach-to-the-interpretation-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1068	NULL	http://hto-c.usc.edu:8000/msms/suffix/,http://tingchen@hto.usc.edu	NULL	NULL
438	Modeling sequencing errors by combining Hidden Markov models	http://Claudio.Lottaz@molgen.mpg.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	16	14	1	Bioinformatics Oxford	C. Lottaz,C. Iseli,C. V. Jongeneel,P. Bucher	NULL	Among the largest resources for biological sequence data isthe large amount of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available inpublic and proprietary databases. ESTs provide information ontranscripts but for technical reasons they often contain sequencingerrors. Therefore, when analyzing EST sequences computationally, sucherrors must be taken into account. Earlier attempts to model errorprone coding regions have shown good performance in detecting andpredicting these while correcting sequencing errors using codon usagefrequencies. In the research presented here, we improve the detectionof translation start and stop sites by integrating a more complexmRNA model with codon usage bias based error correction into onehidden Markov model (HMM), thus generalizing this error correctionapproach to more complex HMMs. We show that our method maintains theperformance in detecting coding sequences.Keywords: coding regionprediction, sequencing errors, expressed sequence tags, hidden Markovmodels.Contact:Claudio.Lottaz@molgen.mpg.de*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

reconstruct tandem duplication trees"	http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/,http://gascuel@lirmm.fr	ORIGINAL PAPER	8	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Olivier Elemento,Olivier Gascuel	NULL	The problem of reconstructing the duplication tree of a set of tandemly repeated sequences which are supposed to have arisen through unequal recombination, was first introduced by Fitch (1977,Genetics,86, 93–104), and has recently received a lot of attention. In this paper, we describe DTSCORE, a fast distance based algorithm to reconstruct tandem duplication trees, which is statistically consistent. As a cousin of the ADDTREE algorithm (Sattath and Tversky, 1977,Psychometrika,42, 319–345), the raw DTSCORE has a time complexity inO(n5), wherenis the number of observed repeated sequences. Through a series of algorithmic refinements, we improve its complexity toO(n4)in the worst case, but stress that the refined DTSCORE algorithm should perform faster with real data. We assess the topological accuracy of DTSCORE using simulated data sets, and compare it to existing reconstruction methods. The results clearly show that DTSCORE is more accurate than all the other methods we studied. Finally, we report the results of DTSCORE on a real dataset.Supplementary information:http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/Contact:gascuel@lirmm.fr	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS92%2f190476	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S92/190476/An-efficient-and-accurate-distance-based-algorithm	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S92	NULL	http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/,http://gascuel@lirmm.fr	NULL	NULL

  distinct DNA and protein domains per genome"	http://ar345@columbia.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	10	100	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Andrey Rzhetsky,Shawn M. Gomez	NULL	Motivation: Current growth in the field of genomics has provideda number of exciting approaches to the modeling of evolutionarymechanisms within the genome. Separately, dynamical and statisticalanalyses of networks such as the World Wide Web and the socialinteractions existing between humans have shown that these networkscan exhibit common fractal properties—including the propertyof being scale-free. This work attempts to bridge these two fieldsand demonstrate that the fractal properties of molecular networksare linked to the fractal properties of their underlyinggenomes.Results: We suggest a stochastic model capable of describing theevolutionary growth of metabolic or signal-transduction networks.This model generates networks that share important statisticalproperties (so-called scale-free behavior) with real molecularnetworks. In particular, the frequency of vertices connected toexactlykother vertices follows a power-law distribution. Theshape of this distribution remains invariant to changes in networkscale: a small subgraph has the same distribution as the completegraph from which it is derived. Furthermore, the model correctlypredicts that the frequencies of distinct DNA and protein domainsalso follow a power-law distribution. Finally, the model leads to asimple equation linking the total number of different DNA andprotein domains in a genome with both the total number of genes andthe overall network topology.Availability: MatLab (MathWorks, Inc.) programs described in thismanuscript are available on request from the authors.Contact:ar345@columbia.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/988/251707/Birth-of-scale-free-molecular-networks-and-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.988	NULL	http://ar345@columbia.edu	NULL	NULL

The programpresented here is designed to analyze automatically images fromhybridization experiments with various arrangements: different kindsof probes (oligonucleotides or complex probes), different supports(nylon filters or glass slides), different labeling of probes(radioactively or fluorescently). The program is currently appliedto oligonucleotide fingerprinting projects and complexhybridizations. The only precondition for the use of the program isthat the targets are arrayed in a grid, which can be approximatelytransformed to an orthogonal equidistant grid by a projectivemapping.Results: We demonstrate that our program can cope with thefollowing problems: global distortion of the grid, missing of gridnodes, local deviation of the spot from its specified grid position.This is checked by different quality measures. The image analysis ofoligonucleotide fingerprint experiments on an entire genetic libraryis used, in clustering procedures, to group related clones together.The results show that the program yields automatically generatedhigh quality input data for follow up analysis such as clusteringprocedures.Availability: The executable files will be available upon requestfor academics.Contact:steinfat@molgen.mpg.de*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000170249100007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/7/634/201839/Automated-image-analysis-for-array-hybridization	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.7.634	NULL	http://steinfat@molgen.mpg.de	NULL	NULL
466	Conformational model for binding site recognition by theE.coliMetJ transcription factor	http://stateslab.wustl.edu/pub/helix/StructureList,http://states@ccb.wustl.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	20	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Rongxiang Liu,Thomas W. Blackwell,David J. States	NULL	Motivation: Current methods for identifying sequence specificbinding sites in DNA sequence using position specific weightmatrices are limited in both sensitivity and specificity. Doublestrand DNA helix exhibits sequence dependent variations inconformation. Interactions between macromolecules result fromcomplementarity of the two tertiary structures. We hypothesize thatthis conformational variation plays a role in transcription factorbinding site recognition, and that the use of this structureinformation will improve the predictive power of transcriptionfactor binding site models.Results: Conformation models for the sequence dependence of DNAhelix distortion have been developed. Using our conformationalmodels, we defined a tertiary structure template for the met operonrepressor MetJ binding site. Both naturally occurring sites andprecursor binding sites identified through in vitro selection wereused as the basis for template definition. The conformational modelappears to recognize features of protein binding sites that aredistinct from the features recognized by primary sequence basedprofiles. Combining the conformational model and primary sequenceprofile yields a hybrid model with improved discriminatory powercompared with either the conformational model or sequence profilealone. Using our hybrid model, we searched the E.coli genome. We areable to identify the documented MetJ sites in the promoter regionsof metA, metB, metC, metR and metF. In addition, we find severalnovel loci with characteristics suggesting that they are functionalMetJ repressor binding sites. Novel MetJ binding sites are foundupstream of the metK gene, as well as upstream of a gene, abc, agene that encodes for a component of a multifunction transporterwhich may transport amino acids across the membrane. The falsepositive rate is significantly lower than the sequence profilemethod.Availability: The programs of implementation of this algorithmare available upon request.

Stormo	NULL	Motivation: Transcriptional activation in eukaryotic organismsnormally requires combinatorial interactions of multipletranscription factors. Though several methods exist foridentification of individual protein binding site patterns in DNAsequences, there are few methods for discovery of binding sitepatterns for cooperatively acting factors. Here we present analgorithm, Co-Bind (for COperative BINDing), for discovering DNAtarget sites for cooperatively acting transcription factors. Themethod utilizes a Gibbs sampling strategy to model the cooperativitybetween two transcription factors and defines position weightmatrices for the binding sites. Sequences from both the training setand the entire genome are taken into account, in order todiscriminate against commonly occurring patterns in the genome, andproduce patterns which are significant only in the training set.Results: We have tested Co-Bind on semi-synthetic and real datasets to show it can efficiently identify DNA target site patternsfor cooperatively binding transcription factors. In cases wherebinding site patterns are weak and cannot be identified by otheravailable methods, Co-Bind, by virtue of modeling the cooperativitybetween factors, can identify those sites efficiently. Thoughdeveloped to model protein–DNA interactions, the scope ofCo-Bind may be extended to combinatorial, sequence specific,interactions in other macromolecules.Availability: The program is available upon request from theauthors or may be downloaded fromhttp://ural.wustl.edu.Contact:dg@genetics.wustl.edu;stormo@genetics.wustl.edu	2001-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000170249100005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/7/608/201798/Identifying-target-sites-for-cooperatively-binding	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.7.608	NULL	http://ural.wustl.edu,http://dg@genetics.wustl.edu,http://stormo@genetics.wustl.edu	NULL	NULL

Laroco, Jr	NULL	Motivation: To identify and characterize regions of functionalinterest in genomic sequence requires full, flexible query access toan integrated, up-to-date view of all related information,irrespective of where it is stored (within an organization or acrossthe Internet) and its format (traditional database, flat file, website, results of runtime analysis). Wide-ranging multi-sourcequeries often return unmanageably large result sets, requiringnon-traditional approaches to exclude extraneous data.Results: Target Informatics Net (TINet) is a readily extensibledata integration system developed at GlaxoSmith- Kline (GSK), basedon the Object-Protocol Model (OPM) multidatabase middleware systemof Gene Logic Inc. Data sources currently integrated include: theMouse Genome Database (MGD) and Gene Expression Database (GXD),GenBank, SwissProt, PubMed, GeneCards, the results of runtime BLASTand PROSITE searches, and GSK proprietary relational databases.Special-purpose class methods used to filter and augment queryresults include regular expression pattern-matching over BLAST HSPalignments and retrieving partial sequences derived from primarystructure annotations. All data sources and methods are accessiblethrough an SQL-like query language or a GUI, so that when newinvestigations arise no additional programming beyond queryspecification is required. The power and flexibility of thisapproach are illustrated in such integrated queries as: (1)‘find homologs in genomic sequence to all novel genes clonedand reported in the scientific literature within the past threemonths that are linked to the MeSH term ‘neoplasms”; (2)‘using a neuropeptide precursor query sequence, return onlyHSPs where the target genomic sequences conserve the G[KR][KR] motifat the appropriate points in the HSP alignment’; and (3)‘of the human genomic sequences annotated with exon boundariesin GenBank, return only those with valid putative donor/acceptorsites and start/stop codons’.Availability: Freely available to non-profit educational andresearch institutions.

  sequence alignment"	http://grishin@chop.swmed.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	117	228	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jimin Pei,Nick V. Grishin	NULL	Motivation: Amino acid sequence alignments are widely used in theanalysis of protein structure, function and evolutionaryrelationships. Proteins within a superfamily usually share the samefold and possess related functions. These structural and functionalconstraints are reflected in the alignment conservation patterns.Positions of functional and/or structural importance tend to be moreconserved. Conserved positions are usually clustered in distinctmotifs surrounded by sequence segments of low conservation. Poorlyconserved regions might also arise from the imperfections inmultiple alignment algorithms and thus indicate possible alignmenterrors. Quantification of conservation by attributing a conservationindex to each aligned position makes motif detection moreconvenient. Mapping these conservation indices onto a proteinspatial structure helps to visualize spatial conservation featuresof the molecule and to predict functionally and/or structurallyimportant sites. Analysis of conservation indices could be a usefultool in detection of potentially misaligned regions and will aid inimprovement of multiple alignments.Results: We developed a program to calculate a conservation indexat each position in a multiple sequence alignment using severalmethods. Namely, amino acid frequencies at each position areestimated and the conservation index is calculated from thesefrequencies. We utilize both unweighted frequencies and frequenciesweighted using two different strategies. Three conceptuallydifferent approaches (entropy-based, variance-based and matrixscore-based) are implemented in the algorithm to define theconservation index. Calculating conservation indices for 35522positions in 284 alignments from SMART database we demonstrate thatdifferent methods result in highly correlated (correlationcoefficient more than 0.85) conservation indices. Conservationindices show statistically significant correlation betweensequentially adjacent positionsiiiandi+ji+ji\ +\ j, wherej<13j<13j\ {<}\ 13, and averaging of the indices over the window of threepositions is optimal for motif detection. Positions with gapsdisplay substantially lower conservation properties. We compareconservation properties of the SMART alignments or FSSP structuralalignments to those of the ClustalW alignments. The results suggestthat conservation indices should be a valuable tool of alignmentquality assessment and might be used as an objective function forrefinement of multiple alignments.Availability: The C code of the AL2CO program and itspre-compiled versions for several platforms as well as the detailsof the analysis are freely available atftp://iole.swmed.edu/pub/al2co/.Contact:grishin@chop.swmed.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171021000004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/8/700/234805/AL2CO-calculation-of-positional-conservation-in-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.8.700	NULL	http://grishin@chop.swmed.edu	NULL	NULL

Torda	NULL	Motivation: We propose a general method for deriving amino acidsubstitution matrices from low resolution force fields. Unlikecurrent popular methods, the approach does not rely on evolutionaryarguments or alignment of sequences or structures. Instead, residuesare computationally mutated and their contribution to the totalenergy/score is collected. The average of these values over eachposition within a set of proteins results in a substitutionmatrix.Results: Example substitution matrices have been calculated fromforce fields based on different philosophies and their performancecompared with conventional substitution matrices. Although this canproduce useful substitution matrices, the methodology highlights thevirtues, deficiencies and biases of the source force fields. It alsoallows a rather direct comparison of sequence alignment methods withthe score functions underlying protein sequence to structurethreading.Availability: Example substitution matrices are available fromhttp://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html.Supplementaryinformation: The list of proteins used for data collection and theoptimized parameters for the alignment are given as supplementarymaterial athttp://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html.Contact:zsuzsa@rsc.anu.edu.au*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171021000003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/8/686/234776/Amino-acid-similarity-matrices-based-on-force	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.8.686	NULL	http://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html,http://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html,http://zsuzsa@rsc.anu.edu.au	NULL	NULL

The filter algorithm would be based ondynamic programming optimization. It would have the advantage overprevious filter algorithms that its substitution scoring functiondistinguishes between conservative and non-conservative amino acidsubstitutions.Results: Simulated annealing was used to search for the bestfive-bit or three-bit patterns to represent amino acids, wheresimilar amino acids were given similar bit-patterns. The similaritybetween amino acids was estimated from the BLOSUM45 matrix.Representing amino acids by these five-bit and three-bit patterns,theEscherichia coliPhoE precursor and the bacteriophagePA2LC precursor were aligned.

Sakharkar,Tin Wee Tan,Sandro J. de Souza	NULL	Motivation: Intron sliding is the relocation of intron–exonboundaries over short distances and is often also referred to asintron slippage or intron migration or intron drift. We havegenerated a database containing discordant intron positions inhomologous genes (MIDB—MismatchedIntronDataBase). Discordant intron positions are those thatare either closely located in homologous genes (within a window of10 nucleotides) or an intron position that is present in one genebut not in any of its homologs. The MIDB database aims atsystematically collecting information about mismatched introns inthe genes from GenBank and organizing it into a form useful forunderstanding the genomics and dynamics of introns thereby helpingunderstand the evolution of genes.Results: Intron displacement or sliding is critically importantfor explaining the present distribution of introns among orthologousand paralogous genes. MIDB allows examining of intron movements andallows mapping of intron positions from homologous proteins onto asingle sequence. The database is of potential use for molecularbiologists in general and for researchers who are interested in geneevolution and eukaryotic gene structure.

Zmasek,Sean R. Eddy	NULL	Motivation: When analyzing protein sequences using sequencesimilarity searches, orthologous sequences (that diverged byspeciation) are more reliable predictors of a new protein’sfunction than paralogous sequences (that diverged by geneduplication), because duplication enables functionaldiversification. The utility of phylogenetic information inhigh-throughput genome annotation (‘phylogenomics’) iswidely recognized, but existing approaches are either manual orindirect (e.g. not based on phylogenetic trees). Our goal is toautomate phylogenomics using explicit phylogenetic inference. Anecessary component is an algorithm to infer speciation andduplication events in a given gene tree.Results: We give an algorithm to infer speciation and duplicationevents on a gene tree by comparison to a trusted species tree. Thisalgorithm has a worst-case running time of O(n2n2n^{2})which is inferior to two previous algorithms that are∼∼{\sim}O(nnn) for a gene tree ofnnnsequences.However, our algorithm is extremely simple, and its asymptotic worstcase behavior is only realized on pathological data sets. We showempirically, using 1750 gene trees constructed from the Pfam proteinfamily database, that it appears to be a practical (and oftensuperior) algorithm for analyzing real gene trees.Availability:http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/foresterContact:zmasek@genetics.wustl.edu;eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	2001-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171566400006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/9/821/206499/A-simple-algorithm-to-infer-gene-duplication-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.9.821	NULL	http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/forester,http://zmasek@genetics.wustl.edu,http://eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=7&types=bbb11111	NULL

The individual sampling and maximizationsteps of the algorithm require no more computational resourcesthan pairwise alignment.Methods: We present a softwareimplementation (Handel) of our algorithm and report testresults on (i) simulated data sets and (ii) the structurallyinformed protein alignments of BAliBASE (Thompsonet al., 1999,Nucleic Acids Res.,27,2682–2690).Results: We find that the mean sum-of-pairs score (a measure ofresidue-pair correspondence) for the BAliBASE alignments is only 13%lower forHandelthan forCLUSTALW(Thompsonet al., 1994,Nucleic Acids Res.,22,4673–4680), despite the relative simplicity of the links model(CLUSTALWuses affine gap scores and increasedpenalties for indels in hydrophobic regions). With reference tothese benchmarks, we discuss potential improvements to the linksmodel and implications for Bayesian multiple alignment andphylogenetic profiling.Availability: The source code toHandelis freelydistributed on the Internet athttp://www.biowiki.org/Handelunderthe terms of the GNU Public License (GPL, 2000,http://www.fsf.org./copyleft/gpl.html).Contact:ihh@fruitfly.org	2001-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171566400005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/9/803/206492/Evolutionary-HMMs-a-Bayesian-approach-to-multiple	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.9.803	NULL	http://www.biowiki.org/Handel,http://www.fsf.org./copyleft/gpl.html,http://ihh@fruitfly.org	NULL	NULL

When the two genomes are rotated suchthat a pair of orthologs with the shortest distance is set in thesame angle, a statistically significant number of orthologs maintaintheir relative locations between the genomes. Even by the shortdistances at the 5% significance level, the rotations are restrictedwithin a narrow range, suggesting an intrinsic angle for realizingsimilar locations between the orthologs in each genome pair.Furthermore, the rotations in the restricted range agree with thereplication origin and terminus sites for the analyzed genomes wheresuch sites are known.

  heterogeneity associated with phenotype into location heterogeneity"	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jeanne Kowalski	NULL	Motivation: The analysis of genetic data poses statisticalproblems in the form of high dimensionality with small sample sizes.The construction of a composite gene region (sequence pair)heterogeneity measure is one technique for reducing thedimensionality of the problem. This approach however is not withoutcost, since the contribution of locations to observed gene regiondifferences between groups becomes entangled in this summarymeasure. This is problematic since it is of scientific interest toidentify locations that together depict phenotype.Results: A method is proposed for relating observed gene regionheterogeneity back to the location level. In the spirit of a factoranalysis-type setting, the approach focuses on identifying a latentvariable structure among locations to explain within and betweengroup genetic differences associated with phenotype. The method isflexible for identifying either the additive contribution fromindividual locations or the additive contribution from a group oflocations, to observed gene region heterogeneity, depending upon theweighting scheme used in constructing a gene region heterogeneitymeasure. The approach is illustrated with clinical trial data, wherethe problem of altered HIV drug susceptibility is examined throughcharacterizing location contributions to HIV protease gene regiondifferences associated with a phenotypic treatment response.Availability: The Splus (MathSoft, Inc.

Ruzzo	NULL	Motivation: There is a great need to develop analyticalmethodology to analyze and to exploit the information contained ingene expression data. Because of the large number of genes and thecomplexity of biological networks, clustering is a usefulexploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Otherclassical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA),have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Usingdifferent data analysis techniques and different clusteringalgorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very differentconclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principalcomponents (PCs) in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, usingboth real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared thequality of clusters obtained from the original data to the qualityof clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principalcomponent axes.Results: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the PCsinstead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, andoften degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few PCs(which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarilycapture most of the cluster structure. We also showed thatclustering with PCs has different impact on different algorithms anddifferent similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend PCAbefore clustering except in special circumstances.Contact:kayee@cs.washington.eduSupplementaryinformation:http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/pca*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171566400002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/9/763/206456/Principal-component-analysis-for-clustering-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.9.763	NULL	http://kayee@cs.washington.edu,http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/pca	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL

Yeung,C. Fraley,A. Murua,A. E. Raftery,W. L. Ruzzo	NULL	Motivation: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for theanalysis of gene expression data. Many different heuristicclustering algorithms have been proposed in this context. Clusteringalgorithms based on probability models offer a principledalternative to heuristic algorithms. In particular, model-basedclustering assumes that the data is generated by a finite mixture ofunderlying probability distributions such as multivariate normaldistributions. The issues of selecting a ‘good’clustering method and determining the ‘correct’ numberof clusters are reduced to model selection problems in theprobability framework. Gaussian mixture models have been shown to bea powerful tool for clustering in many applications.Results: We benchmarked the performance of model-based clusteringon several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for whichexternal evaluation criteria were available. The model-basedapproach has superior performance on our synthetic data sets,consistently selecting the correct model and the number of clusters.On real expression data, the model-based approach produced clustersof quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering algorithm,but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of clusters andan appropriate model. We also explored the validity of the Gaussianmixture assumption on different transformations of real data. Wealso assessed the degree to which these real gene expression datasets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and aftersubjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitablychosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits.Availability: Mclustis available athttp://www.stat.washington.edu/fraley/mclust.The software for the diagonal model is under development.Contact:kayee@cs.washington.eduSupplementaryinformation:http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/model*To whom all correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300015&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/977/251689/Model-based-clustering-and-data-transformations	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.977	NULL	http://www.stat.washington.edu/fraley/mclust,http://kayee@cs.washington.edu,http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/model	NULL	NULL

Gonzalez	NULL	Motivation: Class I α-mannosidases comprise ahomologous and functionally diverse family of glycoside hydrolases.Phylogenetic analysis based on an amino acid sequence alignment ofthe catalytic domain of class I α-mannosidases revealsfour well-supported phylogenetic groups within this family. Thesegroups include a number of paralogous members generated by geneduplications that occurred as far back as the initial divergence ofthe crown-group of eukaryotes. Three of the four phylogenetic groupsconsist of enzymes that have group-specific biochemical specificityand/or sites of activity. An attempt has been made to uncover therole that natural selection played in the sequence and structuraldivergence between the phylogenetically and functionally distinctEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus groups.Results: Comparison of site-specific amino acid variabilityprofiles for the ER and Golgi groups revealed statisticallysignificant evidence for functional diversification at the sequencelevel and indicated a number of residues that are most likely tohave played a role in the functional divergence between the twogroups. The majority of these sites appear to contain residues thathave been fixed within one organelle-specific group by positiveselection. Somewhat surprisingly these selected residues map to theperiphery of the α-mannosidase catalytic domain tertiarystructure. Changes in these peripherally located residues would notseem to have a gross effect on protein function. Thus diversifyingselection between the two groups may have acted in a gradual mannerconsistent with the Darwinian model of natural selection.Contact:bishogr@millsaps.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/965/251672/Sequence-and-structural-aspects-of-functional	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.965	NULL	http://bishogr@millsaps.edu	NULL	NULL

Inprotein-folding prediction, the location of disulfide bridges canstrongly reduce the search in the conformational space. Thereforethe correct prediction of the disulfide connectivity starting fromthe protein residue sequencemay also help in predicting its 3Dstructure.Results: In this paper we equate the problem of predicting thedisulfide connectivity in proteins to a problem of finding the graphmatching with the maximum weight. The graph vertices are theresidues of cysteine-forming disulfide bridges, and the weight edgesare contact potentials. In order to solve this problem we developand test different residue contact potentials. The best performingone, based on the Edmonds–Gabow algorithm and Monte-Carlosimulated annealing reaches an accuracy significantly higher thanthat obtained with a general mean force contact potential.Significantly, in the case of proteins with four disulfide bonds inthe structure, the accuracy is 17 times higher than that of a randompredictor.

These, in fact, often represent a heavy atomand its associated hydrogens (i.e. a united atom). Also, atom typingis usually done according to basic chemistry, giving rise to20–30 protein atom types, such as carbonyl carbons, methylgroups, and hydroxyl groups. No one has yet investigated how similarin packing these chemically derived types are. Here we address thisquestion in detail, using Voronoi volume calculations on a set ofhigh-resolution crystal structures.Results: We perform a rigorous clustering analysis withcross-validation on tens of thousands of atom volumes and attempt tocompile them into types based purely on packing. From our analysis,we are able to determine a ‘minimal’ set of 18 atomtypes that most efficiently represent the spectrum of packing inproteins. Furthermore, we are able to uncover a number ofinconsistencies in traditional chemical typing schemes, wheredifferently typed atoms have almost the same effective size. Inparticular, we find that tetrahedral carbons with two hydrogens arealmost identical in size to many aromatic carbons with a singlehydrogen.Availability: Programs available fromhttp://geometry.molmovdb.org.Contact:JerryTsai@TAMU.edu;neil.voss@yale.edu;Mark.Gerstein@yale.eduSupplementaryInformation: Available athttp://geometry.molmovdb.org.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/949/251640/Determining-the-minimum-number-of-types-necessary	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.949	NULL	http://geometry.molmovdb.org,http://JerryTsai@TAMU.edu,http://neil.voss@yale.edu,http://Mark.Gerstein@yale.edu,http://geometry.molmovdb.org	NULL	NULL

Sincethis is only a sufficient, but not a necessary condition forstructural similarity, the question remains what other criteria canbe used to identify remote homologues. Transitivity refers to theconcept of deducing a structural similarity between proteinsAandCfrom the existence of a third proteinB,such thatAandBas well asBandCarehomologues, as ascertained if the sequence identity betweenAandBas well as that betweenBandCisabove the aforementioned threshold. It is not fully understood iftransitivity always holds and whether transitivity can be extendedad infinitum.Results: We developed a graph-based clustering approach, wheretransitivity plays a crucial role. We determined all pair-wisesimilarities for the sequences in the SwissProt database using theSmith–Waterman local alignment algorithm. This data wastransformed into a directed graph, where protein sequencesconstitute vertices. A directed edge was drawn from vertexAto vertexBif the sequencesAandBshowed similarity, scaled with respect to theself-similarity ofA, above a fixed threshold. Transitivitywas important in the clustering process, as intermediate sequenceswere used, limited though by the requirement of having directedpaths in both directions between proteins linked over suchsequences. The length dependency—implied by theself-similarity—of the scaling of the alignment scores appearsto be an effective criterion to avoid clustering errors due tomulti-domain proteins. To deal with the resulting large graphs wehave developedan efficient library. Methods include the novelgraph-based clustering algorithm capable of handling multi-domainproteins and cluster comparison algorithms.

Conventional MultipleSequence Alignment (MSA) based methods find difficulties when facedwith heterogeneous groups of proteins. However, even many familiesof proteins that do share a common domain contain instances ofseveral other domains, without any common underlying linearordering. Ignoring this modularity may lead to poor or even falseclassification results. An automated method that can analyze a groupof proteins into the sequence domains it contains is thereforehighly desirable.Results: We apply a novel method to the problem of protein domaindetection. The method takes as input an unaligned group of proteinsequences. It segments them and clusters the segments into groupssharing the same underlying statistics. A Variable Memory Markov(VMM) model is built using a Prediction Suffix Tree (PST) datastructure for each group of segments. Refinement is achieved byletting the PSTs compete over the segments, and a deterministicannealing framework infers the number of underlying PST models whileavoiding many inferior solutions. We show that regions of similarstatistics correlate well with protein sequence domains, by matchinga unique signature to each domain. This is done in a fully automatedmanner, and does not require or attempt an MSA. Severalrepresentative cases are analyzed. We identify a protein fusionevent, refine an HMM superfamily classification into the underlyingfamilies the HMM cannot separate, and detect all 12 instances of ashort domain in a group of 396 sequences.Contact:jill@cs.huji.ac.il;tishby@cs.huji.ac.il*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/927/251588/Markovian-domain-fingerprinting-statistical	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.927	NULL	http://jill@cs.huji.ac.il,http://tishby@cs.huji.ac.il	NULL	NULL

Traditional manual annotation by literature curation andsequence analysis tools without the use of automated annotationsystems is not able to keep up with the ever increasing quantity ofdata that is submitted. Automated supplements to manually curateddatabases such as TrEMBL or GenPept cover raw data but provide onlylimited annotation. To improve this situation automatic tools areneeded that support manual annotation, automatically increase theamount of reliable information and help to detect inconsistencies inmanually generated annotations.Results: A standard data mining algorithm was successfullyapplied to gain knowledge about the Keyword annotation inSWISS-PROT. 11 306 rules were generated, which areprovided in a database and can be applied to yet unannotated proteinsequences and viewed using a web browser. They rely on the taxonomyof the organism, in which the protein was found and on signaturematches of its sequence. The statistical evaluation of the generatedrules by cross-validation suggests that by applying them onarbitrary proteins 33% of their keyword annotation can be generatedwith an error rate of 1.5%.

The approaches used in gene identificationprograms are often tuned to one particular organism, and accuracyfor one organism or class of organism does not necessarily translateto accurate predictions for other organisms. In this paper weevaluate five computer programs on their ability to locate codingregions and to predict gene structure inNeurospora crassa.One of these programs (FFG) was designed specifically forgene-finding inN.crassa, but the model parameters havenot yet been fully ‘tuned’, and the program should thusbe viewed as an initial prototype. The other four programs wereneither designed nor tuned forN.crassa.Results: We describe the data sets on which the experiments wereperformed, the approaches employed by the five algorithms: GenScan,HMMGene, GeneMark, Pombe and FFG, the methodology of our evaluation,and the results of the experiments. Our results show that, whilenone of the programs consistently performs well, overall the GenScanprogram has the best performance on sensitivity and Missing Exons(ME) while the HMMGene and FFG programs have good performance inlocating the exons roughly. Additional work motivated by this studyincludes the creation of a tool for the automated evaluation ofgene-finding programs, the collection of larger and more reliabledata sets forN.crassa, parameterization of the model usedin FFG to produce a more accurate gene-finding program for thisspecies, and a more in-depth evaluation of the reasons that existingprograms generally fail forN.crassa.Availability: Data sets, the FFG program source code, and linksto the other programs analyzed are available athttp://jerry.cs.uga.edu/~wang/genefind.htmlContact:eileen@cs.uga.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/901/251546/An-analysis-of-gene-finding-programs-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.901	NULL	http://jerry.cs.uga.edu/~wang/genefind.html,http://eileen@cs.uga.edu	NULL	NULL

Kochetov,Fyodor A. Kondrashov,Eugene V. Koonin,Luciano Milanesi	NULL	Motivation: The context of the start codon (typically, AUG) andthe features of the 5′ Untranslated Regions(5′ UTRs) are important for understanding translationregulation in eukaryotic mRNAs and for accurate prediction of thecoding region in genomic and cDNA sequences. The presence of AUGtriplets in 5′ UTRs (upstream AUGs) might effect theinitiation rate and, in the context of gene prediction, could reducethe accuracy of the identification of the authentic start. To revealpotential connections between the presence of upstream AUGs andother features of 5′ UTRs, such as their length and thestart codon context, we undertook a systematic analysis of theavailable eukaryotic 5′ UTR sequences.Results: We show that a large fraction of 5′ UTRs inthe available cDNA sequences, 15–53% depending on theorganism, contain upstream ATGs. A negative correlation was observedbetween the information content of the translation start signal andthe length of the 5′ UTR. Similarly, a negativecorrelation exists between the ‘strength’ of the startcontext and the number of upstream ATGs. Typically, cDNAs containinglong 5′ UTRs with multiple upstream ATGs have a‘weak’ start context, and in contrast, cDNAs containingshort 5′ UTRs without ATGs have ‘strong’starts. These counter-intuitive results may be interpreted in termsof upstream AUGs having an important role in the regulation oftranslation efficiency by ensuring low basal translation level viadouble negative control and creating the potential for additionalregulatory mechanisms. One of such mechanisms, supported byexperimental studies of some mRNAs, includes removal of theAUG-containing portion of the 5′ UTR by alternativesplicing.Availability: An ATG_ EVALUATOR program is available upon requestor atwww.itba.mi.cnr.it/webgene.Contact:rogozin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,milanesi@itba.mi.cnr.it4To whom correspondence should be addressed atNCBI/NLM/NIH, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg 38A, Rm 805, Bethesda, MD20894, USA.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/890/251525/Presence-of-ATG-triplets-in-5-untranslated-regions	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.890	NULL	http://www.itba.mi.cnr.it/webgene,http://rogozin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,http://milanesi@itba.mi.cnr.it	NULL	NULL

  genomic sequence"	http://samuel.levy@celera.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	96	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Samuel Levy,Sridhar Hannenhalli,Christopher Workman	NULL	Motivation: Whole genome shotgun sequencing strategies generatesequence data prior to the application of assembly methodologiesthat result in contiguous sequence. Sequence reads can be employedto indicate regions of conservation between closely related speciesfor which only one genome has been assembled. Consequently, by usingpairwise sequence alignments methods it is possible to identifynovel, non-repetitive, conserved segments in non-coding sequencethat exist between the assembled human genome and mouse whole genomeshotgun sequencing fragments. Conserved non-coding regions identifypotentially functional DNA that could be involved in transcriptionalregulation.Results: Local sequence alignment methods were applied employingmouse fragments and the assembled human genome. In addition,transcription factor binding sites were detected by aligning theircorresponding positional weight matrices to the sequence regions.These methods were applied to a set of transcripts corresponding to502 genes associated with a variety of different human diseasestaken from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Usingstatistical arguments we have shown that conserved non-codingsegments contain an enrichment of transcription factor binding siteswhen compared to the sequence background in which the conservedsegments are located. This enrichment of binding sites was notobserved in coding sequence. Conserved non-coding segments are notextensively repeated in the genome and therefore theiridentification provides a rapid means of finding genes with relatedconserved regions, and consequently potentially related regulatorymechanism. Conserved segments in upstream regions are found tocontain binding sites that are co-localized in a manner consistentwith experimentally known transcription factor pairwiseco-occurrences and afford the identification of novel co-occurringTranscription Factor (TF) pairs. This study provides a methodologyand more evidence to suggest that conserved non-coding regions arebiologically significant since they contain a statistical enrichmentof regulatory signals and pairs of signals that enable theconstruction of regulatory models for human genes.Contact:samuel.levy@celera.com*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000171690300003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/10/871/251495/Enrichment-of-regulatory-signals-in-conserved-non	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.10.871	NULL	http://samuel.levy@celera.com	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Stormo	NULL	Motivation: High density DNA oligo microarrays are widely used inbiomedical research. Selection of optimal DNA oligos that aredeposited on the microarrays is critical. Based on sequenceinformation and hybridization free energy, we developed a newalgorithm to select optimal short (20–25 bases) or long (50 or70 bases) oligos from genes or open reading frames (ORFs) andpredict their hybridization behavior. Having optimized probes foreach gene is valuable for two reasons. By minimizing backgroundhybridization they provide more accurate determinations of trueexpression levels. Having optimum probes minimizes the number ofprobes needed per gene, thereby decreasing the cost of eachmicroarray, raising the number of genes on each chip and increasingits usage.Results: In this paper we describe algorithms to optimize theselection of specific probes for each gene in an entire genome. Thecriteria for truly optimum probes are easily stated but they are notcomputable at all levels currently. We have developed an heuristicapproach that is efficiently computable at all levels and shouldprovide a good approximation to the true optimum set.

In the case of short-chainantisense oligonucleotides (asON) which usually comprise less thanapproximately 25 nucleotides, local structures of the target RNA seemto be of particular importance for the extent of gene suppression.Experimental approaches to identify promising local target sequencesand, hence, complementary asON sequences, have provided tools todefine asON that are biologically active at higher than statisticalprobability. However, experimental protocols are expensive, timeconsuming, and are associated with intrinsic basic and technicallimitations. As insights into the structure–functionrelationship of asON as well as the role of sequence motifs increase,it becomes feasible to consider computer-based theoretical approachesfor the design of effective asON. In the following we describe howindividual steps of the theoretical design of asON may be automatedby establishing and implementing suitable algorithms.	2001-11-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2f11%2f1058%2f176174	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/11/1058/176174/Concepts-to-automate-the-theoretical-design-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.11.1058	NULL	http://sczakiel@imm.mu-luebeck.de	NULL	NULL

Kolchanov	NULL	Motivation: It is known that the physico-chemical characteristicsof proteins underlying specific folding of the polypeptide chain andthe protein function are evolutionary conserved. Detection of suchcharacteristics while analyzing homologous sequences would expandessentially the knowledge on protein function, structure, andevolution. These characteristics are maintained constant, inparticular, by co-ordinated substitutions. In this process, thedestabilizing effect of a substitution may be compensated by anothersubstitution at a different position within the same protein, makingthe overall change in this protein characteristic insignificant.Consequently, the patterns of co-ordinated substitutions containimportant information on conserved physico-chemical properties ofproteins, requiring their investigation and development of thecorresponding methods and software for correlation analysis ofprotein sequences available to a wide range of users.Results: A software package for analyzing correlated amino acidsubstitutions at different positions within aligned proteinsequences was developed. The approach implies searching forevolutionary conserved physico-chemical characteristics of proteinsbased on the information on the pairwise correlations of amino acidsubstitutions at different protein positions. The software wasapplied to analyze DNA-binding domains of the homeodomain class. Asa result, two conservative physico-chemical characteristicspreserved due to the co-ordinated substitutions at certain groups ofpositions in the protein sequence. Possible functional roles ofthese characteristics are discussed.Availability: The program package is available athttp://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/programs/CRASP/Contact:ada@bionet.nsc.ru*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000172377500006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/11/1035/176109/Detection-of-conserved-physico-chemical	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.11.1035	NULL	http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/programs/CRASP/,http://ada@bionet.nsc.ru	NULL	NULL

Michael Gromiha,Samuel Selvaraj,Hatsuho Uedaira,Hidetoshi Kono,Akinori Sarai	NULL	Motivation: Protein–nucleic acid interactions arefundamental to the regulation of gene expression. In order toelucidate the molecular mechanism of protein–nucleic acidrecognition and analyze the gene regulation network, not onlystructural data but also quantitative binding data are necessary.Although there are structural databases for proteins and nucleicacids, there exists no database for their experimental binding data.Thus, we have developed a Thermodynamic Database forProtein–Nucleic Acid Interactions (ProNIT).Results: We have collected experimentally observed binding datafrom the literature. ProNIT contains several important thermodynamicdata for protein–nucleic acid binding, such as dissociationconstant (Kd), association constant(Ka), Gibbs free energy change(ΔG), enthalpy change (ΔH), heat capacitychange (ΔCp), experimentalconditions, structural information of proteins, nucleic acids andthe complex, and literature information. These data are integratedinto a relational database system together with structural andfunctional information to provide flexible searching facilities byusing combinations of various terms and parameters. A www interfaceallows users to search for data based on various conditions, withdifferent display and sorting options, and to visualize molecularstructures and their interactions.Availability: ProNIT is freely accessible at the URLhttp://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/jouhou/pronit/pronit.html.Contact:sarai@rtc.riken.go.jp*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000172377500005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/11/1027/176084/Thermodynamic-database-for-protein-nucleic-acid	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.11.1027	NULL	http://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/jouhou/pronit/pronit.html,http://sarai@rtc.riken.go.jp	NULL	NULL

Growing amounts of geneexpression data provide the possibility of finding coregulated genesby clustering methods.

Motifs are extracted by exhaustive analysis ofregular expression-like patterns and by estimating probabilities ofpositional clusters of motifs. ITB detects consensus sequences ofexperimentally verified transcription factor binding sites of theyeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mironov	NULL	Motivation: Sequencing of complete eukaryotic genomes and largesyntenic fragments of genomes makes it possible to apply genomiccomparison for gene recognition.Results: This paper describes a spliced alignment algorithm thataligns candidate exon chains of two homologous genomic sequencefragments from different species. The algorithm is implemented inPro-Gen software. Unlike other algorithms, Pro-Gen does not assumeconservation of the exon–intron structure. Amino acidsequences obtained by the formal translation of candidate exons arealigned instead of nucleotide sequences, which allows for distantcomparisons. The algorithm was tested on a sample ofhuman–mammal (mouse), human–vertebrate (Xenopus) and human–invertebrate (Drosophila) gene pairs.Surprisingly, the best results, 97–98% correlation between theactual and predicted genes, were obtained for more distantcomparisons, whereas the correlation on the human–mouse samplewas only 93%. The latter value increases to 95% if conservation ofthe exon–intron structure is assumed. This is caused by alarge amount of sequence conservation in non-coding regions of thehuman and mouse genes probably due to regulatoryelements.Availaility: Pro-Gen v. 3.0 is available to academicresearchers free of charge athttp://www.anchorgen.com/pro_gen/pro_gen.html.Contact:misha@imb.imb.ac.ru*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000172377500003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/11/1011/176041/Gene-recognition-in-eukaryotic-DNA-by-comparison	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.11.1011	NULL	http://www.anchorgen.com/pro_gen/pro_gen.html,http://misha@imb.imb.ac.ru	NULL	NULL

It was found that in promoters oftissue-specific genes, the nucleosome formation potential wasessentially higher than in genes expressed in many tissues, orhousekeeping genes.

Taylor	NULL	Motivation: Many of the most interesting functional andevolutionary relationships among proteins are so ancient that theycannot be reliably detected through sequence analysis and areapparent only through a comparison of the tertiary structures. Theconserved features can often be described as structural motifsconsisting of a few single residues or Secondary Structure (SS)elements. Confidence in such motifs is greatly boosted when they arefound in more than a pair of proteins.Results: We describe an algorithm for the automatic discovery ofrecurring patterns in protein structures. The patterns consist ofindividual residues having a defined order along the protein’sbackbone that come close together in the structure and whose spatialconformations are similar. The residues in a pattern need not beclose in the protein’s sequence. The work described in thispaper builds on an earlier reported algorithm for motif discovery.This paper describes a significant improvement of the algorithmwhich makes it very efficient.

The aim of this work is to improve upon current methodsand provide a performance guaranteed prediction.Methods: Thisis achieved by using two modules, one sensitive to the conservedmotif and the other sensitive to the coding/non-coding potentialaround the start codon. Both modules are based on Artificial NeuralNetworks (ANNs). By applying the simplified method of the ribosomescanning model, the algorithm starts a linear search at thebeginning of the coding ORF and stops once the combination of thetwo modules predicts a positive score.Results: According to the results of the test group, 94% ofthe TIS were correctly predicted. A confident decision is obtainedthrough the use of the Las Vegas algorithm idea.

One drawback of neuralnetworks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understandand interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper,we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, andstill achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approachwhich consists of an extensive search for simple rules and variousattributes which is partially guided by human intuition.Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose predictionaccuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining avery simple and interpretable form.

The data obtainedby microarray analyses are called expression profile data. One typeof important information underlying the expression profile data isthe ‘genetic network,’ that is, the regulatory networkamong genes. Graphical Gaussian Modeling (GGM) is a widely utilizedmethod to infer or test relationships among a plural ofvariables.Results: In this study, we developed a method combining thecluster analysis with GGM for the inference of the genetic networkfrom the expression profile data. The expression profile data of2467 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes measured under 79 differentconditions (Eisenet al.,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.USA,95, 14683–14868, 1998) were used for thisstudy. At first, the 2467 genes were classified into 34 clusters bya cluster analysis, as a preprocessing for GGM. Then, the expressionlevels of the genes in each cluster were averaged for eachcondition. The averaged expression profile data of 34 clusters weresubjected to GGM, and a partial correlation coefficient matrix wasobtained as a model of the genetic network of S. cerevisiae.

We show how the dynamics ofthese networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markovchains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, wediscuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks—afamily of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilisticrelationships between variables. We show how probabilisticdependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting thebasic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained fromPBNs.

For example, ratios of microarray channelsintensities are normalized to have common mean over the set ofgenes. We made an attempt to understand the meaning of suchprocedures from the modeling point of view, and to formulate themodel assumptions that underlie them. Given a considerable diversityof data adjustment procedures, the question of their performance,comparison and ranking for various microarray experiments was ofinterest.Results: A two-step statistical procedure is proposed: datatransformation (adjustment for slide-specific effect) followed by astatistical test applied to transformed data.

Willson,George E. Fox	NULL	Motivation: The phylogenetic structure of the bacterial world hasbeen intensively studied by comparing sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA(16S rRNA). This database of sequences is now widely used to designprobes for the detection of specific bacteria or groups of bacteriaone at a time. The success of such methods reflects the fact thatthere are local sequence segments that are highly characteristic ofparticular organisms or groups of organisms. It is not clear,however, the extent to which such signature sequences exist in the16S rRNA dataset. A better understanding of the numbers anddistribution of highly informative oligonucleotide sequences mayfacilitate the design of hybridization arrays that can characterizethe phylogenetic position of an unknown organism or serve as thebasis for the development of novel approaches for use in bacterialidentification.Results: A computer-based algorithm that characterizes the extentto which any individual oligonucleotide sequence in 16S rRNA ischaracteristic of any particular bacterial grouping was developed. Ameasure of signature quality,Qs, wasformulated and subsequently calculated for every individualoligonucleotide sequence in the size range of 5–11 nucleotidesand for 15mers with reference to each cluster and subcluster in a929 organism representative phylogenetic tree. Subsequently, theperfect signature sequences were compared to the full set of 7322sequences to see how common false positives were. The work completedhere establishes beyond any doubt that highly characteristicoligonucleotides exist in the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence dataset inlarge numbers. Over 16000 15mers were identified that might beuseful as signatures.

Sola	NULL	Motivation: The Direct Repeat (DR) locus ofMycobacteriumtuberculosisis a suitable model to study (i) molecularepidemiology and (ii) the evolutionary genetics of tuberculosis.This is achieved by a DNA analysis technique (genotyping), calledspaceroligonucleotidetyping(spoligotyping). In this paper, we investigated dataanalysis methods to discover intelligible knowledge rules fromspoligotyping, that has not yet been applied on such representation.This processing was achieved by applying the C4.5 inductionalgorithm and knowledge rules were produced. Finally, a PrototypeSelection (PS) procedure was applied to eliminate noisy data. Thisboth simplified decision rules, as well as the number of spacers tobe tested to solve classification tasks. In the second part of thispaper, the contribution of 25 new additional spacers and theknowledge rules inferred were studied from a machine learning pointof view. From a statistical point of view, the correlations betweenspacers were analyzed and suggested that both negative and positiveones may be related to potential structural constraints within theDR locus that may shape its evolution directly or indirectly.Results: By generating knowledge rules induced from decisiontrees, it was shown that not only the expert knowledge may bemodeled but also improved and simplified to solve automaticclassification tasks on unknown patterns. A practical consequence ofthis study may be a simplification of the spoligotyping technique,resulting in a reduction of the experimental constraints and anincrease in the number of samples processed.Contact:csola@pasteur.gp*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174028100003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/2/235/225532/A-data-mining-approach-to-spacer-oligonucleotide	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.2.235	NULL	http://csola@pasteur.gp	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

Whileseveral methods have been developed to predict DNA mosaicstructures, they do not properly address the question of whether thepredicted segmentation itself is statistically significant, orwhether it is significantly better than an alternative mosaicstructure predicted with another method. The objective of thepresent article is to devise an approximate Bayesian hypothesis testto discriminate between alternative candidate mosaic structures.Results: We have applied the proposed discrimination scheme tovarious synthetic and real-world DNA sequence alignments. On thesynthetic data, the algorithm identified the true mosaic structurein nine out of ten cases. On the real-world sequence alignments, itselected the same mosaic structures as predicted in theliterature.Availability: Software written in MATLAB as well as the data setsused in our study are available fromhttp://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/software/ABBESS/INFO.html.Contact:dirk@bioss.ac.uk;frank@bioss.ac.uk	2002-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174028100002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/2/226/225521/A-Bayesian-approach-to-discriminate-between	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.2.226	NULL	http://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/software/ABBESS/INFO.html,http://dirk@bioss.ac.uk,http://frank@bioss.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Kierzek	NULL	Motivation: The availability of a huge amount of molecular dataconcerning various biochemical reactions provoked numerous attemptsto study the dynamics of cellular processes by means of kineticmodels and computer simulations. Biochemical processes frequentlyinvolve small numbers of molecules (e.g. a few molecules of atranscriptional regulator binding to one ‘molecule’ of aDNA regulatory region). Such reactions are subject to significantstochastic fluctuations. Monte Carlo methods must be employed tostudy the functional consequences of the fluctuations and simulateprocesses that cannot be modelled by continuous fluxes of matter.This provides the motivation to develop software dedicated to MonteCarlo simulations of cellular processes with the rigorously provenGillespie algorithm.Results: STOCKS, software for the stochastic kinetic simulationof biochemical processes is presented. The program uses a rigorouslyderived Gillespie algorithm that has been shown to be applicable tothe study of prokaryotic gene expression. Features dedicated to thestudy of cellular processes are implemented, such as the possibilityto study a process in the range of several cell generations with theapplication of a simple cell division model. Taking expression ofEscherichia coli beta-galactosidase as an example, it is shown thatthe program is able to simulate systems composed of reactionsvarying in several orders of magnitude by means of reaction ratesand the numbers of molecules involved.Availability: The software is available atftp://ibbrain.ibb.waw.pl/stocksandhttp://www.ibb.waw.pl/stocks.Supplementaryinformation: Parameters of the model of prokaryotic gene expressionare available in example files of software distribution.Contact:andrzejk@ibb.waw.pl	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/470/236748/STOCKS-STOChastic-Kinetic-Simulations-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.470	NULL	http://www.ibb.waw.pl/stocks,http://andrzejk@ibb.waw.pl	NULL	NULL
571	The complexity of comparing reaction systems	http://ettinger@lanl.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	7	6	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Mark Ettinger	NULL	Motivation: As more genomic data becomes available there isincreased attention on understanding the mechanisms encoded in thegenome. New XML dialects like CellML and Systems Biology MarkupLanguage (SBML) are being developed to describe biological networksof all types. In the absence of detailed kinetic information forthese networks, stoichiometric data is an especially valuable sourceof information. Network databases are the next logical step beyondstoring purely genomic information. Just as comparison of entries ingenomic databases has been a vital algorithmic problem through thecourse of the sequencing project, comparison of networks in networkdatabases will be a crucial problem as we seek to integratehigher-order network knowledge.Results: We show that comparing the stoichiometric structure oftwo reactions systems is equivalent to the graph isomorphismproblem. This is encouraging because graph isomorphism is, inpractice, a tractable problem using heuristics. The analogousproblem of searching for a subsystem of a reaction system isNP-complete. We also discuss heuristic issues in implementations forpractical comparison of stoichiometric matrices.Contact:ettinger@lanl.gov	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/465/236723/The-complexity-of-comparing-reaction-systems	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.465	NULL	http://ettinger@lanl.gov	NULL	NULL

Sharlow	NULL	Motivation: Progressive Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) methodsdepend on reducing an MSA to a linear profile for each alignmentstep. However, this leads to loss of information needed for accuratealignment, and gap scoring artifacts.Results: We present a graph representation of an MSA that canitself be aligned directly by pairwise dynamic programming,eliminating the need to reduce the MSA to a profile. This enablesour algorithm (Partial Order Alignment (POA)) to guarantee that theoptimal alignment of each new sequence versus each sequence in theMSA will be considered. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a newedit operator, homologous recombination, important for multidomainsequences. The algorithm has improved speed (linear time complexity)over existing MSA algorithms, enabling construction of massive andcomplex alignments (e.g. an alignment of 5000 sequences in 4 h on aPentium II). We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm on afamily of multidomain SH2 proteins, and on EST assemblies containingalternative splicing and polymorphism.Availability: The partial order alignment program POA isavailable athttp://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa.Contact:leec@mbi.ucla.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.2Current address:center for Applied Mathematics, 657 Rhodes Hall, Cornell University,Ithaca NY 14853, USA.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/452/236691/Multiple-sequence-alignment-using-partial-order	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.452	NULL	http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa,http://leec@mbi.ucla.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=5&types=tttttttt	NULL

The result is that thestrategyassis suitable for a large number of processingunits (the time was divided by a factor of 12 when the number ofprocessing units was increased from 1 to 16) wheras the strategyaldis better for a small set of processors (typically forfour or six).The different proposed strategies are efficient forvarious applications in genomic research, particularly for locatingsimilarities of nucleic sequences in large genomes.Availability:d-assircis freely available by anonymousFTP atftp://ftp.ens.fr/pub/molbio/dassirc.tar.gz.Sources and binaries for Solaris and Linux are included in thedistribution.Contact:vincens@biologie.ens.fr*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/446/236660/D-ASSIRC-distributed-program-for-finding-sequence	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.446	NULL	http://vincens@biologie.ens.fr	NULL	NULL

These datasets are valuable only if they are annotated bysufficiently detailed experiment descriptions. However, in manydatabases a substantial number of these annotations is in free-textformat and not readily accessible to computer-aided analysis.Results: The Multi-Conditional Hybridization Intensity ProcessingSystem (M-CHIPS), a data warehousing concept, focuses on providingboth structure and algorithms suitable for statistical analysis of amicroarray database’s entire contents including the experimentannotations. It addresses the rapid growth of the amount ofhybridization data, more detailed experimental descriptions, and newkinds of experiments in the future. We have developed astorageconcept, a particular instance of which is anorganism-specific database. Although these databases may containdifferent ontologies of experiment annotations, they share the samestructure and therefore can be accessed by the very same statisticalalgorithms. Experiment ontologies have not yet reached their finalshape, and standards are reduced to minimal conventions that do notyet warrant extensive description. An ontology-independent structureenables updates of annotation hierarchies during normal databaseoperation without altering the structure.Availability and supplementary information:http://www.dkfz.de/tbi/services/mchipsContact:k.fellenberg@dkfz.de*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.3Present address:Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Ihnestr. 73, D-14195Berlin, Germany.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/423/236562/Microarray-data-warehouse-allowing-for-inclusion	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.423	NULL	http://www.dkfz.de/tbi/services/mchips,http://k.fellenberg@dkfz.de	NULL	NULL

Peel	NULL	Motivation: This paper introduces the software EMMIX-GENE thathas been developed for the specific purpose of a model-basedapproach to the clustering of microarray expression data, inparticular, of tissue samples on a very large number of genes. Thelatter is a nonstandard problem in parametric cluster analysisbecause the dimension of the feature space (the number of genes) istypically much greater than the number of tissues. A feasibleapproach is provided by first selecting a subset of the genesrelevant for the clustering of the tissue samples by fittingmixtures oftdistributions to rank the genes in order ofincreasing size of the likelihood ratio statistic for the test ofone versus two components in the mixture model. The imposition of athreshold on the likelihood ratio statistic used in conjunction witha threshold on the size of a cluster allows the selection of arelevant set of genes. However, even this reduced set of genes willusually be too large for a normal mixture model to be fitteddirectly to the tissues, and so the use of mixtures of factoranalyzers is exploited to reduce effectively the dimension of thefeature space of genes.Results: The usefulness of the EMMIX-GENE approach for theclustering of tissue samples is demonstrated on two well-known datasets on colon and leukaemia tissues. For both data sets, relevantsubsets of the genes are able to be selected that reveal interestingclusterings of the tissues that are either consistent with theexternal classification of the tissues or with background andbiological knowledge of these sets.Availability: EMMIX-GENE is available athttp://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~gjm/emmix-gene/Contact:gjm@maths.uq.edu.au	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/413/236534/A-mixture-model-based-approach-to-the-clustering	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.413	NULL	http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~gjm/emmix-gene/,http://gjm@maths.uq.edu.au	NULL	NULL

Kohane	NULL	Motivation: The existence of several technologies for measuringgene expression makes the question of cross-technology agreement ofmeasurements an important issue. Cross-platform utilization of datafrom different technologies has the potential to reduce the need toduplicate experiments but requires corresponding measurements to becomparable.Methods: A comparison of mRNA measurements of 2895sequence-matched genes in 56 cell lines from the standard panel of60 cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI 60) wascarried out by calculating correlation between matched measurementsand calculating concordance between cluster from two high-throughputDNA microarray technologies, Stanford type cDNA microarrays andAffymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays.Results: In general, corresponding measurements from the twoplatforms showed poor correlation. Clusters of genes and cell lineswere discordant between the two technologies, suggesting thatrelative intra-technology relationships were not preserved.GC-content, sequence length, average signal intensity, and anestimator of cross-hybridization were found to be associated withthe degree of correlation. This suggests gene-specific, or morecorrectly probe-specific, factors influencing measurementsdifferently in the two platforms, implying a poor prognosis for abroad utilization of gene expression measurements acrossplatforms.Contact:wpkuo@mit.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.1These authorscontributed equally to this work.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/405/236502/Analysis-of-matched-mRNA-measurements-from-two	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.405	NULL	http://wpkuo@mit.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=wwwddddd	NULL

McCardle,I. O. Ellis,C. Creaser,R. C. Rees	NULL	Motivation: MALDI mass spectrometry is able to elicitmacromolecular expression data from cellular material and when usedin conjunction with Ciphergen protein chip technology (also referredto as SELDI—Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization), itpermits a semi-high throughput approach to be taken with respect tosample processing and data acquisition. Due to the large array ofdata that is generated from a single analysis (8–10000variables using a mass range of 2–15 kDa—this paper) itis essential to implement the use of algorithms that can detectexpression patterns from such large volumes of data correlating to agiven biological/pathological phenotype from multiple samples. Ifsuccessful, the methodology could be extrapolated to larger datasets to enable the identification of validated biomarkerscorrelating strongly to disease progression. This would not onlyserve to enable tumours to be classified according to theirmolecular expression profile but could also focus attention upon arelatively small number of molecules that might warrant furtherbiochemical/molecular characterization to assess their suitabilityas potential therapeutic targets.Results: Using a multi-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network(ANN) (Neuroshell 2) with a back propagation algorithm we havedeveloped a prototype approach that uses a model system (comprisingfive low and seven high-grade human astrocytomas) to identify massspectral peaks whose relative intensity values correlate strongly totumour grade. Analyzing data derived from MALDI mass spectrometry inconjunction with Ciphergen protein chip technology we have usedrelative importance values, determined from the weights of trainedANNs (Ballset al.,Water, Air Soil Pollut.,85, 1467–1472, 1996), to identify masses thataccurately predict tumour grade. Implementing a three-stageprocedure, we have screened a population of approximately100000–120000 variables and identified two ions(m/zvalues of 13454 and 13457) whose relative intensitypattern was significantly reduced in high-grade astrocytoma. Thedata from this initial study suggests that application of ANN-basedapproaches can identify molecular ion patterns which stronglyassociate with disease grade and that its application to largercohorts of patient material could potentially facilitate the rapididentification of validated biomarkers having significant clinical(i.e. diagnostic/prognostic) potential for the field of cancerbiology.Availability: Neuroshell 2 is commercially available from wardsystems.Contact:graham.balls@ntu.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/395/236473/An-integrated-approach-utilizing-artificial-neural	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.395	NULL	http://graham.balls@ntu.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Klus,Michael L. Bittner,Yidong Chen,Zoltan Szallasi	NULL	Motivation: The simplest level of statistical analysis of cancerassociated gene expression matrices is aimed at finding consistentlyup- or down-regulated genes within a given set of tumor samples.Considering the high level of gene expression diversity detected incancer, one needs to assess the probability that the consistentmis-regulation of a given gene is due to chance. Furthermore, it isimportant to determine the required sample number that will ensurethe meaningful statistical analysis of massively parallel geneexpression measurements.Results: The probability of consistent mis-regulation iscalculated in this paper for binarized gene expression data, usingcombinatorial considerations. For practical purposes, we alsoprovide a set of accurate approximate formulas for determining thesame probability in a computationally less intensive way. When thepool of mis-regulatable genes is restricted, the probability ofconsistent mis-regulation can be overestimated. We show, however,that this effect has little practical consequences for cancerassociated gene expression measurements published in the literature.Finally, in order to aid experimental design, we have providedestimates on the required sample number that will ensure that thedetected consistent mis-regulation is not due to chance. Our resultssuggest that less than 20 sufficiently diverse tumor samples may beenough to identify consistently mis-regulated genes in astatistically significant manner.Availability: An implementation usingMathematicatmof the main equation of thepaper, (4), is available atwww.me.chalmers.se/~mwahde/bioinfo.html.Contact:mwahde@me.chalmers.se,zszallasi@chip.org*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/389/236449/Assessing-the-significance-of-consistently-mis	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.389	NULL	http://www.me.chalmers.se/~mwahde/bioinfo.html,http://mwahde@me.chalmers.se,http://zszallasi@chip.org	NULL	NULL

Tammi,Erik Arner,Tom Britton,Björn Andersson	NULL	An increasingly important problem in genome sequencing is thefailure of the commonly used shotgun assembly programs to correctlyassemble repetitive sequences. The assembly of non-repetitive regionsor regions containing repeats considerably shorter than the averageread length is in practice easy to solve, while longer repeats havebeen a difficult problem. We here present a statistical method toseparate arbitrarily long, almost identical repeats, which makes itpossible to correctly assemble complex repetitive sequence regions.The differencesbetween repeat units may be as low as 1% and thesequencing error may be up to ten times higher. The method is basedon the realization that a comparison of only a part of alloverlapping sequences at a time in a data set does not generateenough information for a conclusive analysis. Our method uses optimalmulti-alignments consisting of all the overlaps of each read. Thismakes it possible to determine defined nucleotide positions, DNPs,which constitute the differences between the repeat units.Differences between repeats are distinguished from sequencing errorsusing statistical methods, where the probabilities of obtainingcertain combinations of candidate DNPs are calculated using theinformation from the multi-alignments. The use of DNPs andcombinations of DNPs will allow for optimal and rapid assemblies ofrepeated regions. This method can solve repeats that differ in onlytwo positions in a read length, which is the theoretical limit forrepeat separation. We predict that this method will be highly usefulin shotgun sequencing in the future.Contact:bjorn.andersson@genpat.uu.se*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000174708500002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/3/379/236423/Separation-of-nearly-identical-repeats-in-shotgun	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.379	NULL	http://bjorn.andersson@genpat.uu.se	NULL	NULL

Up to now, there havebeen conflicting results on how correlated the levels of these twoquantities are. Given that expression and abundance data aresignificantly more complex and noisy than the underlying genomicsequence information, it is reasonable to simplify and average themin terms of broad proteomic categories and features (e.g. functionsor secondary structures), for understanding their relationship.Furthermore, it will be essential to integrate, within a commonframework, the results of many varied experiments by differentinvestigators. This will allow one to survey the characteristics ofhighly expressed genes and proteins.Results: To this end, we outline a formalism for merging andscaling many different gene expression and protein abundance datasets into a comprehensive reference set, and we develop an approachfor analyzing this in terms of broad categories, such ascomposition, function, structure and localization. As the variousexperiments are not always done using the same set of genes,sampling bias becomes a central issue, and our formalism is designedto explicitly show this and correct for it. We apply our formalismto the currently available gene expression and protein abundancedata for yeast. Overall, we found substantial agreement between geneexpression and protein abundance, in terms of the enrichment ofstructural and functional categories. This agreement, which wasconsiderably greater than the simple correlation between thesequantities for individual genes, reflects the way broad categoriescollect many individual measurements into simple, robust averages.In particular, we found that in comparison to the population ofgenes in the yeast genome, the cellular populations of transcriptsand proteins (weighted by their respective abundances, thetranscriptome and what we dub the translatome) were both enrichedin: (i) the small amino acids Val, Gly, and Ala; (ii) low molecularweight proteins; (iii) helices and sheets relative to coils; (iv)cytoplasmic proteins relative to nuclear ones; and (v) proteinsinvolved in ‘protein synthesis,’ ‘cellstructure,’ and ‘energyproduction.’Supplementary information:http://genecensus.org/expression/translatomeContact:mark.gerstein@yale.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.†These authorscontributed equally to this work.	2002-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000175542200010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/4/585/242990/Analysis-of-mRNA-expression-and-protein-abundance	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.4.585	NULL	http://genecensus.org/expression/translatome,http://mark.gerstein@yale.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=11111111	NULL

Hoyle,Magnus Rattray,Ray Jupp,Andrew Brass	NULL	Motivation: Typical analysis of microarray data has focusedonspot by spot comparisons within a single organism. Less analysis hasbeen done on the comparison of the entire distribution of spotintensities between experiments and between organisms.Results: Here we show that mRNA transcription data from a widerange of organisms and measured with a range of experimentalplatforms show close agreement with Benford’s law (Benford,Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.,78, 551–572, 1938) andZipf’s law (Zipf,The Psycho-biology of Language: anIntroduction to Dynamic Philology, 1936 andHumanBehaviour and the Principle of Least Effort, 1949). Thedistribution of the bulk of microarray spot intensities is wellapproximated by a log-normal with the tail of the distribution beingcloser to power law. The variance,σ2, of logspot intensity shows a positive correlation with genome size (interms of number of genes) and is therefore relatively fixed withinsome range for a given organism. The measured value ofσ2can be significantly smaller than theexpected value if the mRNA is extracted from a sample of mixed celltypes.

  expression data"	http://is@ieee.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	50	100	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ilya Shmulevich,Wei Zhang	NULL	Motivation: Most approaches to gene expression analysis usereal-valued expression data, produced by high-throughput screeningtechnologies, such as microarrays. Often, some measure of similaritymust be computed in order to extract meaningful information from theobserved data. The choice of this similarity measure frequently hasa profound effect on the results of the analysis, yet no standardsexist to guide the researcher.Results: To address this issue, we propose to analyse geneexpression data entirely in the binary domain. The natural measureof similarity becomes the Hamming distance and reflects the notionof similarity used by biologists. We also develop a noveldata-dependent optimization-based method, based on GeneticAlgorithms (GAs), for normalizing gene expression data. This is anecessary step before quantizing gene expression data into thebinary domain and generally, for comparing data between differentarrays. We then present an algorithm for binarizing gene expressiondata and illustrate the use of the above methods on two differentsets of data. Using Multidimensional Scaling, we show that areasonable degree of separation between different tumor types ineach data set can be achieved by working solely in the binarydomain.

Recently several statistical methods have been proposedto accomplish this goal when there are replicated samples under eachcondition. However, it may not be clear how these methods comparewith each other. Our main goal here is to compare three methods, thet-test, a regression modeling approach (Thomasetal.,Genome Res.,11, 1227–1236, 2001)and a mixture model approach (Panet al.,http://www.biostat.umn.edu/cgi-bin/rrs?print+2001,2001a,b) with particular attention to their different modelingassumptions.Results: It is pointed out that all the three methods are basedon using the two-samplet-statistic or its minor variation,but they differ in how to associate a statistical significance levelto the corresponding statistic, leading to possibly large differencein the resulting significance levels and the numbers of genesdetected. In particular, we give an explicit formula for the teststatistic used in the regression approach. Using the leukemia dataof Golubet al.(Science,285,531–537, 1999), we illustrate these points. We also brieflycompare the results with those of several other methods, includingthe empirical Bayesian method of Efronet al.(J. Am.Stat.

  approach: an application of minimum spanning trees"	http://xyn@ornl.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	96	115	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ying Xu,Victor Olman,Dong Xu	NULL	Motivation: Gene expression data clustering provides a powerfultool for studying functional relationships of genes in a biologicalprocess. Identifying correlated expression patterns of genesrepresents the basic challenge in this clustering problem.Results: This paper describes a new framework for representing aset of multi-dimensional gene expression data as a Minimum SpanningTree (MST), a concept from the graph theory. A key property of thisrepresentation is that each cluster of the expression datacorresponds to one subtree of the MST, which rigorously converts amulti-dimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem.We have demonstrated that though the inter-data relationship isgreatly simplified in the MST representation, no essentialinformation is lost for the purpose of clustering. Two keyadvantages in representing a set of multi-dimensional data as an MSTare: (1) the simple structure of a tree facilitates efficientimplementations of rigorous clustering algorithms, which otherwiseare highly computationally challenging; and (2) as an MST-basedclustering does not depend on detailed geometric shape of a cluster,it can overcome many of the problems faced by classical clusteringalgorithms. Based on the MST representation, we have developed anumber of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms, includingtwo with guaranteed global optimality. We have implemented thesealgorithms as a computer software EXpression data ClusteringAnalysis and VisualizATiOn Resource (EXCAVATOR). To demonstrate itseffectiveness, we have tested it on three data sets, i.e. expressiondata from yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, expression datain response of human fibroblasts to serum, andArabidopsisexpression data in response to chitin elicitation.

For example,over-representedk-mers in co-regulated families of genes areassociated with the DNA binding sites of transcription factors. Tomeasure over-representation, we introduce a statistical backgroundmodel based on single-mismatches, and apply it to the pooled 500 bpORF Upstream Regions (USRs) of yeast. More importantly, weinvestigate the context and spatial distribution of over-representedk-mers in yeast USRs.Results: Single and double-stranded spatial distributions of mostover-representedk-mers are highly non-random, andpredominantly cluster into a small number of classes that are robustwith respect to over-representation measures.

  as a discrete channel with noise"	http://chris.brown@stonebow.otago.ac.nz	ORIGINAL PAPER	0	10	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Mark Schreiber,Chris Brown	NULL	Motivation: Calculation of the information content of motifsingenomes highly biased in nucleotide composition is likely to lead tooverestimates of the amount of useful informationin the motif.Calculating relative information can compensate for biases, howeverthe resulting information content is the amount seen by an observerand not by a macromolecule binding to the motif. The latter isneeded to calculate the discriminatory power of the motif and tocompare motifs between species.Results: By treating a biased genome as a discrete channel withnoise, in accordance with Shannon Information Theory, we were ableto remove both ‘Distortion’ and ‘Noise’ fromthe motif and recover a more instructive biological‘signal.’ A Java application, LogoPaint, was developedto remove nucleotide bias distortion and triplet frequency noisefrom motifs, calculate information content and present the motif asa logo. We demonstrate how this technique can ‘unmask’motifs in the translation initiation regions of bacteria that areobscured by strong sequence biases.Availability: LogoPaint is available to all users from theauthors as an executable JAR file.

analysis of DNA microarray spots through adaptive pixel
clustering"	http://dbozinov@unmc.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	14	63	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Daniel Bozinov,Jörg Rahnenführer	NULL	Motivation: Microarray images challenge existing analytical methodsin many ways given that gene spots are often comprised of characteristic imperfections. Irregular contours, donut shapes, artifacts, and low or heterogeneous expression impair corresponding values for red and green intensities as well as their ratio R/G. New approaches are needed to ensure accurate data extraction from these images.Results: Herein we introduce a novel method for intensity assessment of gene spots. The technique is based on clustering pixels of atarget area into foreground and background. For this purpose we implemented two clustering algorithms derived from k-means and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), respectively. Results from the analysis of real gene spots indicate that our approach performs superior to other existing analytical methods. This is particularly true for spots generally considered as problematic due to imperfections or almost absent expression. BothPXPAMand PXKMEANSprove to be highly robust against various types of artifacts through adaptive partitioning, which more correctly assesses expression intensity values.Availability: The implementation of this method is a combination of two complementary tools Extractiff (Java) and Pixclust (free statistical language R), which are available upon request from the authors.Contact:dbozinov@unmc.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.†Both authors contributed equally tothis manuscript.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/747/199854/Unsupervised-technique-for-robust-target	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.747	NULL	http://dbozinov@unmc.edu	NULL	NULL

Clustering(grouping genes with similar expression profiles) is one of the first stepsin data analysis of high-throughput expression measurements. A number ofclustering algorithms have proved useful to make sense of such data. Theseclassical algorithms, though useful, suffer from several drawbacks (e.g. they require the predefinition of arbitrary parameters like the number ofclusters; they force every gene into a cluster despite a low correlationwith other cluster members). In the following we describe a novel adaptivequality-based clustering algorithm that tackles some of these drawbacks.Results: We propose a heuristic iterative two-step algorithm:First, we find in the high-dimensional representation of the data a spherewhere the ‘density’ of expression profiles is locally maximal (based on a preliminary estimate of the radius of the cluster—quality-based approach). In a second step, we derive an optimal radius of the cluster(adaptive approach) so that only the significantly coexpressed genes areincluded in the cluster. This estimation is achieved by fitting a model tothe data using an EM-algorithm. By inferring the radius from the dataitself, the biologist is freed from finding an optimal value for this radiusby trial-and-error. The computational complexity of this method isapproximately linear in the number of gene expression profiles in the dataset. Finally, our method is successfully validated using existing data sets.Availability:http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~thijs/Work/Clustering.htmlContact:frank.desmet@esat.kuleuven.ac.be*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/735/199831/Adaptive-quality-based-clustering-of-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.735	NULL	http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~thijs/Work/Clustering.html,http://frank.desmet@esat.kuleuven.ac.be	NULL	NULL

This work is aimed at discovering special types of gene groups that satisfy the following property. In each group, its member genes are found to be one-to-one contained inpre-determined intervals of gene expression level with a large frequency in one class of cells but are never found unanimously in these intervals in the other class of cells. We call these gene groupsemerging patterns, to emphasize the patterns' frequency changes between two classes of cells. We use effective discretization and gene selection methodsto obtain the most discriminatory genes.We also use efficient algorithms to derive the patterns from these genes. According to our studies on the ALL/AML dataset and the colon tumor dataset, some patterns, which consist of one or more genes, can reach a high frequency of 90%, or even 100%. In other words, they nearly or fully dominate one class of cells,even though they rarely occur in the other class. The discovered patterns are used to classify new cells with a higher accuracy than other reported methods. Based on these patterns, we also conjecture the possibility of a personalized treatment plan which converts colon tumor cells into normal cells by modulating the expression levels of a few genes.Contact:jinyan@krdl.org.sg;limsoon@krdl.org.sg*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/725/199802/Identifying-good-diagnostic-gene-groups-from-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.725	NULL	http://jinyan@krdl.org.sg,http://limsoon@krdl.org.sg	NULL	NULL

The proposed index is normalized to the chain size, is notcorrelated to the gyration radius of the backbone chain and is able todistinguish between structures for which the sum of the main-chain dihedralangles is identical. The index is well correlated to the percentages ofhelix and strand in proteins, shows a linear dependence with temperaturechanges, and is able to differentiate among protein families.Availability: On request from the author.Contact:estrada66@yahoo.com	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/697/199738/Characterization-of-the-folding-degree-of-proteins	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.697	NULL	http://estrada66@yahoo.com	NULL	NULL

protein classification and identification of key amino acid
positions"	http://nelaz@ra.anl.gov,http://fstevens@anl.gov,http://jaques.reifman@amedd.army.mil	ORIGINAL PAPER	21	69	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Nela Zavaljevski,Fred J. Stevens,Jaques Reifman	NULL	Motivation: Data that characterize primary and tertiary structures of proteins are now accumulating at a rapid and accelerating rate and require automated computational tools to extract critical information relating amino acid changes with the spectrum of functionally attributes exhibited by a protein. We propose that immunoglobulin-type beta-domains, which are found in approximate 400 functionally distinct forms in humans alone, provide the immense genetic variation within limited conformational changes that might facilitate the development of new computational tools. As an initial step, we describe here an approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology to identify amino acid variations that contribute to the functional attribute of pathological self-assembly by some human antibody light chains produced during plasma cell diseases.Results: We demonstrate that SVMs with selective kernel scaling are an effective tool in discriminating between benign and pathologic human immunoglobulin light chains. Initial results compare favorably against manual classification performed by experts and indicate the capability of SVMs to capture the underlying structure of the data. The data set consists of 70 proteins of human antibodyκ1 light chains, each represented by aligned sequences of 120 amino acids. We perform feature selection based on a first-order adaptive scaling algorithm, which confirms the importance of changes in certain amino acid positions and identifies other positions that are key in the characterization of protein function.Contact:nelaz@ra.anl.govfstevens@anl.govjaques.reifman@amedd.army.mil*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/689/199716/Support-vector-machines-with-selective-kernel	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.689	NULL	http://nelaz@ra.anl.gov,http://fstevens@anl.gov,http://jaques.reifman@amedd.army.mil	NULL	NULL

complexity"	http://csweb.haifa.ac.il/library/#complex,http://bolshoy@research.haifa.ac.il	ORIGINAL PAPER	36	42	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Olga G. Troyanskaya,Ora Arbell,Yair Koren,Gad M. Landau,Alexander Bolshoy	NULL	Motivation: One of the major features of genomic DNAsequences, distinguishing them from texts in most spoken or artificiallanguages, is their high repetitiveness. Variation in the repetitiveness ofgenomic texts reflects the presence and density of different biologicallyimportant messages. Thus, deviation from an expected number of repeats inboth directions indicates a possible presence of a biological signal.Linguistic complexity corresponds to repetitiveness of a genomic text, andpotential regulatory sites may be discovered through construction of typicalpatterns of complexity distribution.Results: We developed software for fast calculation oflinguistic sequence complexity of DNA sequences. Our program utilizes suffixtrees to compute the number of subwords present in genomic sequences,thereby allowing calculation of linguistic complexity in time linear ingenome size. The measure of linguistic complexity was applied to thecomplete genome ofHaemophilus influenzae. Maps of complexity along the entire genome wereobtained using sliding windows of 40, 100, and 2000 nucleotides. Thisapproach provided an efficient way to detect simple sequence repeats in thisgenome. In addition, local profiles of complexity distribution around thestarts of translation were constructed for 21 complete prokaryotic genomes.We hypothesize that complexity profiles correspond to evolutionaryrelationships between organisms. We found principal differences in profilesof the GC-rich and other (non-GC-rich) genomes. We also found characteristicdifferences in profiles of AT genomes, which probably reflect individualspecies variations in translational regulation.Availability: The program is available upon request fromAlexander Bolshoy or athttp://csweb.haifa.ac.il/library/#complexContact:bolshoy@research.haifa.ac.il*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.4O.T. was a summerstudent at Haifa University.

Mar Albà,Roman A. Laskowski,John M. Hancock	NULL	Motivation: Low-complexity or cryptically simple sequences are widespread in proteinsequences but their evolution and function are poorly understood. To datemethods for the detection of low complexity in proteins have been directedtowards the filtering of such regions prior to sequence homology searchesbut not to the analysis of the regionsper se. However, many of these regions are encoded by non-repetitive DNA sequences and may therefore result fromselection acting on protein structure and/or function.Results: We have developed a new tool, based on the SIMPLE algorithm, thatfacilitates the quantification of the amount of simple sequence in proteinsand determines the type of short motifs that show clustering above a certainthreshold. By modifying the sensitivity of the program simple sequencecontent can be studied at various levels, from highly organised tandemstructures to complex combinations of repeats. We compare the relativeamount of simplicity in different functional groups of yeast proteins anddetermine the level of clustering of the different amino acids in theseproteins.Availability: The program is available on request or online athttp://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/SIMPLEContact:j.hancock@cs.rhul.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/672/199674/Detecting-cryptically-simple-protein-sequences	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.672	NULL	http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/SIMPLE,http://j.hancock@cs.rhul.ac.uk	NULL	NULL
619	"The generation of long telomere overhangs in human cells:
a model and its implication"	http://tanclswu@public.wh.hb.cn	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	5	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yu-hua Hao,Zheng Tan	NULL	Motivation: Linear chromosomes carry on both ends repetitive DNA sequences called telomere. In the conventional model of semi-conservative DNA replication, the3′-end of a linear DNA strand cannot be fully replicated, resulting in a single-stranded3′overhang at one end of the double-stranded DNA product. In this model, the length of the overhang is expected to be about the size of an RNA primer (about nine nucleotides for human cells). However, it has been found that the telomereoverhangs in human cells can be as long as several hundred nucleotides. At present, the opinion regarding how such long overhangs are produced is controversial.Results: In order to gain insight into the mechanism by which long telomere overhangs are produced, we derived a mathematical model that can perfectly describe the length distribution of telomere overhangs in several human cell strains. The model suggests that the production of telomere overhangs can be explained by three contributions corresponding to three regions on the G-rich telomere template strand, namely, the region occupied by the last primer, that missed out by this primer at its5′-side and the3′-terminus of the template strand that is inaccessible to primase. The model can also be used to simulate incomplete telomere replication.Contact:tanclswu@public.wh.hb.cn*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176226800004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/5/666/199650/The-generation-of-long-telomere-overhangs-in-human	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.666	NULL	http://tanclswu@public.wh.hb.cn	NULL	NULL

The approach upon which PGAAS is based is to confirm the order of contigs and fill gaps between contigs through peptide links obtained by searching each contig end with BLASTX against protein databases.Results: We used the contig dataset of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcussp. strain PCC7002 (PCC7002), which was sequenced with six-fold coverage and assembled using the Phrap package. The subject database is the protein database of the cyanobacterium,Synechocystissp. strain PCC6803 (PCC6803). We found more than 100 non-redundant peptide segments which can link at least 2 contigs. We tested one pair of linked contigs by sequencing and obtained satisfactory result. PGAAS provides a graphic user interface to show the bridge peptides and pier contigs. We integrated Primer3 into our package to design PCR primers at the adjacent ends of the pier contigs.Availability: We tested PGAAS on a Linux (Redhat 6.2) PC machine. It is developed with free software (MySQL, PHP and Apache).

The  significance of the aromatic–glycine motif"	http://ehudg@post.tau.ac.il	DISCOVERY NOTE	9	49	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ehud Gazit	NULL	Motivation: Tandem peptide repeats play a key role in self-assembly and aggregationprocesses. A notable example is the occurrence of tandem peptide repeats inprionic proteins and their role in the aggregation process that leads to theformation of the prion. One of the structural characteristics that isevident from the comparison of mammalian and yeast prion proteins is the presence of aromatic residues in their tandem repeats. These residues areaccompanied by glycine residues before and/or after the aromatic amino acid.Such aromatic–glycine conjugates are also present in the tandem repeats ofthe large family of the bacterial ice nucleation proteins. To study thesignificance of such aromatic–glycine occurrences, a global analysis of allthe aromatic octapeptide repeats in the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases wasconducted. The search pattern was formulated to compare the number ofconjugates of each of the 20 natural amino acids before or after thedifferent aromatic residues.Results: The presence of aromatic-glycine conjugatesappears to be significantly higher than aromatic conjugates to any otheramino acid. Furthermore, all the six various combination of glycineoccurrences before or after the three aromatic residues are present. No suchpattern was observed for any other amino acid. The significance of thefindings is being discussed in the context of the physicochemical propertiesof aromatic–glycine conjugates and its possible role in the facilitation ofaggregates formation.Contact:ehudg@post.tau.ac.il	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/880/220865/Global-analysis-of-tandem-aromatic-octapeptide	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.880	NULL	http://ehudg@post.tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL

   time proportional to the logarithm of the database size"	http://egiladi@incyte.com,http://mwalker@incyte.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	6	23	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Eldar Giladi,Michael G. Walker,James Z. Wang,Wayne Volkmuth	NULL	Motivation: Searches for near exact sequence matches are performed frequently in large-scale sequencing projects and in comparative genomics.The time and cost of performing these large-scale sequence-similarity searches is prohibitive using even the fastest of the extant algorithms. Faster algorithms are desired.Results: We have developed an algorithm, called SST (Sequence Search Tree), thatsearches a database of DNA sequences for near-exact matches, in time proportional to the logarithm of the database sizen. In SST, we partition each sequence into fragments of fixed length called ‘windows’ using multiple offsets. Each window is mapped into a vector of dimension 4kwhich contains the frequency of occurrence of its componentk-tuples, withka parameter typically in the range 4–6. Then we create a tree-structuredindex of the windows in vector space,with tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ).We identify the nearest neighbors of aquery sequence by partitioning the query intowindows and searching the tree-structured index for nearest-neighbor windows in the database. When the tree is balanced this yields anO(logn) complexity for the search. This complexity was observed in our computations. SST is most effective for applications in which thetarget sequences show a high degree of similarity to thequery sequence, such as assemblingshotgun sequences or matching ESTs to genomic sequence. The algorithm is also an effective filtration method. Specifically, it can be usedas a preprocessing step for other search methods to reduce the complexity of searching one large database against another.

631	Hybrid alignment: high-performance with universal statistics	http://yyu@fau.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	2	16	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yi-Kuo Yu,Ralf Bundschuh,Terence Hwa	NULL	The score statistics of a recently introduced `hybrid alignment' algorithm is studied in detail numerically. An extensive survey across the 2216 models of protein domains contained in the Pfam v5.4 database (Batemanet al.,Nucleic Acids Res.,28, 263–266, 2000) verifies the theoretical predictions: For the position-specific scoring functions used in the Pfam models, the score statistics of hybrid alignment obey the Gumbel distribution, with the key Gumbel parameter λ taking on the asymptotic value 1 universally for all models. Thus, the use of hybrid alignmenteliminates the time-consuming computer simulations normally needed to assignp-values to alignment scores, freeing the users to experiment with different scoring parameters and functions. The performance ofthe hybrid algorithm in detecting sequence homology is also studied. For protein sequences from the SCOP database (Murzinet al.,J. Mol. Biol.,247, 536–540, 1995) using uniform scoring functions, the performance is found to be comparable to the best of the existing methods. Preliminary results using the PfamA database suggest that the hybrid algorithm achieves similar performance as existing methods for position-specific scoring systems as well. Hybrid alignment is thereby established as a high performance alignment algorithm withwell-characterized, universal statistics.Contact:yyu@fau.edu*Present address: Department of Physics, The OhioState University, 174 West 18th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210-1106, USA	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/864/220832/Hybrid-alignment-high-performance-with-universal	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.864	NULL	http://yyu@fau.edu	NULL	NULL

Bhalla	NULL	Motivation: Cellular chemical signaling pathways form complexnetworks that are beginning to be studied at the level of chemical kineticsand databases of reactions. Chemical reaction details are traditionallyrepresented as lists of reactions and rates. This does not map readily tothe block diagram representation familiar to biologists, and obscures thefunctional organization of signaling networks. This study examines motifs insignaling chemistry and reports common features that may help to formalizesuch a mapping between pathway block diagrams and the chemistry. The samemotifs may facilitate data representation and provide functional abstractionof the chemistry.Results: I classified 74 interactions between 25 signaling pathwaysin terms of shared chemical motifs. All interactions in this dataset consistof a few communicating molecules from one set of pathways, and a replicatingset of reactions and molecules from another. Each unique combination of interacting pathways duplicates the chemical reaction scheme of thisreplicating set, but involves different rate constants. Signaling pathwayscan therefore be described in an object-oriented manner as sets of corereactions with well-defined interfaces between pathways. This generalizationlends itself to designing simulators and databases for signaling networks.Availability: Software and example models are freely available fromhttp://www.ncbs.res.in/~bhalla/examples/EGFR_example.htmlContact:bhalla@ncbs.res.in*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/855/220814/The-chemical-organization-of-signaling	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.855	NULL	http://www.ncbs.res.in/~bhalla/examples/EGFR_example.html,http://bhalla@ncbs.res.in	NULL	NULL
633	A novel approach to local reliability of sequence alignments	http://mattias@thep.lu.se	ORIGINAL PAPER	3	19	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Maximilian Schlosshauer,Mattias Ohlsson	NULL	Motivation: The pairwise alignment of biological sequences obtained from an algorithm will in general contain both correct and incorrect parts. Hence, to allow for a valid interpretation of the alignment, the local trustworthiness of the alignment has to be quantified.Results: We present a novel approach that attributes a reliability index to every pair of residues, including gapped regions, in the optimal alignment of two protein sequences. The method is based on a fuzzy recast of the dynamic programming algorithm for sequence alignment in terms of mean field annealing. An extensive evaluation with structural reference alignments not only shows that the probability for a pair of residues to be correctly aligned grows consistently with increasing reliability index, but moreover demonstrates that the value of the reliability index can directly be translated into an estimate of the probability for a correct alignment.Contact:mattias@thep.lu.se	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/847/220787/A-novel-approach-to-local-reliability-of-sequence	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.847	NULL	http://mattias@thep.lu.se	NULL	NULL

Altman	NULL	Motivation: Biological processes can be considered at many levels of detail, ranging from atomic mechanism to general processes such as cell division, cell adhesion or cell invasion. The experimental study of protein function and gene regulation typically provides information at many levels. The representation of hierarchical process knowledge in biology is therefore a major challenge for bioinformatics. To represent high-level processes in the context of their component functions, we have developed a graphical knowledge model for biological processes that supports methods for qualitative reasoning.Results: We assessed eleven diverse models that were developed in the fields of software engineering, business, and biology, to evaluate their suitability for representing and simulating biological processes. Based on this assessment, we combined the best aspects of two models: Workflow/Petri Net and a biological concept model. The Workflow model can represent nesting and ordering of processes, the structural components that participate in the processes, and the roles that they play. It also maps to Petri Nets, which allow verification of formal properties and qualitative simulation. The biological concept model, TAMBIS, provides a framework for describing biological entities that can be mapped to the workflow model. We tested our model by representing malaria parasites invading host erythrocytes, and composed queries, in five general classes, to discover relationships among processes and structural components. We used reachability analysis to answer queries about the dynamic aspects of the model.Availability: The model is available athttp://smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/process-model/Contact:peleg@smi.stanford.eduyeh@smi.stanford.eduruss.altman@stanford.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/825/220757/Modelling-biological-processes-using-workflow-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.825	NULL	http://smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/process-model/,http://peleg@smi.stanford.edu,http://yeh@smi.stanford.edu,http://russ.altman@stanford.edu	NULL	NULL

Michael Gromiha	NULL	Motivation: Prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequenceis one of the most important problems in molecular biology. The successful prediction of solvent accessibility will be very helpful to achieve this goal. In the present work, we have implemented a server, NETASA for predicting solvent accessibility of amino acids using ournewly optimized neural network algorithm. Several new features in the neural network architecture andtraining method have been introduced, and the network learns faster to provideaccuracy values, which are comparable or better than other methods ofASA prediction.Results: Prediction in two and three state classification systems with several thresholds are provided. Our prediction method achieved the accuracy level upto 90%for training and 88% for test data sets.Three state prediction results provide a maximum 65% accuracy for training and 63% for the test data. Applicability of neural networks for ASA prediction has been confirmed with a larger data set andwider range of state thresholds.

C. van Kampen	NULL	Motivation: To enhance the exploration of gene expression data in a metabolic context, one requires an application that allows the integration of this data and which represents this data in a (genome-wide) metabolic map. The layout of this metabolic map must be highly flexible to enable discoveries of biological phenomena. Moreover, it must allow the simultaneous representation of additional information about genes and enzymes. Since the layout and properties of existing maps did not fulfill our requirements, we developed a new way of representing gene expression data in metabolic charts.Results: ViMAc generates user-specified (genome-wide) metabolic maps to explore gene expression data. To enhance the interpretation of these maps information such as sub-cellular localization is included. ViMAc can be used to analyse human or yeast expression data obtained with DNA microarrays or SAGE.

638	Confidence measures for protein fold recognition	http://ingolf.sommer@gmd.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	10	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ingolf Sommer,Alexander Zien,Niklas von Öhsen,Ralf Zimmer,Thomas Lengauer	NULL	Motivation: We present an extensive evaluation of different methods and criteria to detect remote homologs of a given protein sequence.We investigate two associated problems: first, to develop a sensitive searching method to identify possible candidates and, second, to assign a confidence to the putative candidates in order to select the best one.For searching methods where the score distributions are known,p-values are used as confidence measure with great success. For the cases where such theoretical backing is absent, we propose empirical approximations top-values for searching procedures.Results: As a baseline, we review the performances of different methods for detecting remote protein folds (sequence alignment and threading, with and without sequence profiles, global and local).The analysis is performed on a large representative set of protein structures.For fold recognition, we find that methods using sequence profiles generally perform better than methods using plain sequences, and that threading methods perform better than sequence alignment methods.In order to assess the quality of the predictions made, we establish and compare several confidence measures, including raw scores,z-scores, raw score gaps,z-score gaps, and different methods ofp-value estimation.We work our way from the theoretically well backed local scores towards more explorative global and threading scores.The methods for assessing the statistical significance of predictions are compared using specificity--sensitivity plots. For local alignment techniques we find thatp-value methods work best, albeit computationally cheaper methods such as those based on score gaps achieve similar performance. For global methods where no theory is available methods based on score gaps work best.By using the score gap functions as the measure of confidence we improve the more powerful fold recognition methods for whichp-values are unavailable.Availability: The benchmark set is available upon request.Contact:ingolf.sommer@gmd.de*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176553400003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/6/802/220734/Confidence-measures-for-protein-fold-recognition	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.6.802	NULL	http://ingolf.sommer@gmd.de	NULL	NULL

In recent years,several gene-prediction methods have been proposed that work bycomparing anonymous genomic sequences, for example from human and mouse.The main advantage of these methods is that they are based onsimple and generally applicablemeasures of (local) sequence similarity; unlike standard gene-finding approachesthey do not depend on species-specific training data or on the presence of cognate genes in data bases. As all comparative sequence-analysis methods,the new comparative gene-finding approaches critically rely on the quality ofthe underlying sequence alignments.Results: Herein, we describe a new implementation of the sequence-alignment program DIALIGNthat has been developed for alignment of large genomic sequences.

To understand the applicability and limitations of our set, weinvestigated, in detail, the sensitivity of the volume calculations to anumber of factors: (i) the van der Waals radii set, (ii) the criteria forincluding buried atoms in the calculations or atom selection, (iii) themethod of positioning the dividing plane in polyhedra construction, and (iv)the set of structures used in the averaging.Results: We find that different radii sets have only moderate affects to thedistribution and mean of volumes. Atom selection and dividing plane methodscause larger changes in protein atoms volumes. More significantly, we showhow the variation in volumes appears to be clearly related to the quality ofthe structures analyzed, with higher quality structures giving consistentlysmaller average volumes with less variance.Availability/Supplementary Information: Programs and associated data files are available fromhttp://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/geometryandhttp://molmovdb.org.

Ozturk	NULL	Motivation: Availability of the sequences of entire genomes shifts the scientific curiosity towards the identification of function of the genomes in large scale as in genome studies. In the near future, data produced about cellular processes at molecular level will accumulate with an accelerating rate as a result of proteomics studies. In this regard, it is essential to develop tools for storing, integrating, accessing, and analyzing this data effectively.Results: We define an ontology for a comprehensive representation of cellular events. The ontology presented here enables integration of fragmented or incomplete pathway information and supports manipulation and incorporation of the stored data, as well as multiple levels of abstraction. Based on this ontology, we present the architecture of an integrated environment named Patika (Pathway Analysis Tool for Integration and Knowledge Acquisition). Patika is composed of a server-side, scalable, object-oriented database and client-side editors to provide an integrated, multi-user environment for visualizing and manipulating network of cellular events.This tool features automated pathway layout, functional computation support, advanced querying and a user-friendly graphical interface.We expect that Patika will be a valuable tool for rapid knowledge acquisition, microarray generated large-scale data interpretation, disease gene identification, and drug development.Availability: A prototype of Patika is available upon request from the authors.Contact:patika@cs.bilkent.edu.tr*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176911100013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/7/996/256659/Patika-an-integrated-visual-environment-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.7.996	NULL	http://patika@cs.bilkent.edu.tr	NULL	NULL

Mantegna	NULL	Motivation: Comparative genomics provides a powerful way to investigate regularities and differencesobserved at DNA level across species. Here we study the number and location of inverted repeats occurringin complete genomes of bacteria. Inverted repeatsare compatible with the formation of hairpin structures in the messenger RNA. Some of these structures are known to be rho-independent intrinsic terminators.Results: We investigate the number of inverted repeats observed in 37 complete genomes of bacteria. The number of inverted repeats observed is much higherthan expected using Markovian models of DNA sequences in most of the eubacteria.By using the information annotatedin the genomes we discover that in most of theeubacteria the inverted repeats of stem length longer than 8 nucleotides preferentiallylocate near the 3′ end of the nearest coding regions. We also show that IRs characterized bylarge values of the stem length locate preferentially in short non-coding regions bounded by two 3′ endsof convergent genes.By using the program TransTerm recently introduced topredict transcription terminators in bacterial genomes, we conclude that only a part of the observedinverted repeats fullfils the model requirementscharacterizing rho-independent termination inseveral genomes.Availability:http://lagash.dft.unipa.it/IR.htmlContact:mantegna@unipa.it	2002-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176911100010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/7/971/256615/Comparative-genomics-study-of-inverted-repeats-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.7.971	NULL	http://lagash.dft.unipa.it/IR.html,http://mantegna@unipa.it	NULL	NULL

Pancrazio	NULL	Motivation: While the use of cDNA microarrays for functional genomicanalysis has become commonplace, relatively little attention has been placedon false positives, i.e. the likelihood that a change in measuredradioactive or fluorescence intensity may reflect a change in geneexpression when, in fact, there is none. Since cDNA arrays are beingincreasingly used to rapidly distinguish biomarkers for disease detectionand subsequent assay development (Wellmanet al.,Blood,96, 398–404, 2000), the impact of falsepositives can be significant. For the use of this technology, it is necessary todevelop quantitative criteria for reduction of false positives withradioactively-labeled cDNA arrays.Results: We used a single source of RNA (HuT78 T lymphoma cells) toeliminate sample variation and quantitatively examined intensity ratiosusing radioactively labeled cDNA microarrays. Variation in intensity ratioswas reduced by processing microarrays in side-by-side (parallel mode) ratherthan by using the same microarray for two hybridizations (sequential mode).Based on statistical independence, calculation of the expected number offalse positives as a function of threshold showed that a detection limit of|log2R| >0.65 with agreement from three replicates could beused to identify up- or down-modulated genes. Using this quantitativecriteria, gene expression differences between two related T lymphoma celllines, HuT78 and H9, were identified. The relevance of these findings to theknown functional differences between these cell types is discussed.Contact:jxp@cbmse.nrl.navy.mil*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176911100008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/7/953/256570/Quantitative-assessment-of-filter-based-cDNA	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.7.953	NULL	http://jxp@cbmse.nrl.navy.mil	NULL	NULL

However, in the beginning experimentalists arelikely to focus on globular proteins to achieve a rapid basic coverage ofprotein sequence space. How many proteins will structural genomics have totarget? How many proteins will be excluded since we already have structuralinformation for these or since they are not globular? We have to answerthese questions in the context of our target selection for the North-EastStructural Genomics Consortium (NESG).Results: We estimated that structural information is available forabout 6–38% of all proteins; 6% if we require high accuracy in comparative modelling, 38% if we are satisfied with having a rough idea about the fold. Excluding all regions that are not globular, we found thatstructural genomics may have to target about 48% of all proteins. This corresponded to a similar percentage of residues of the entire proteomes(52%). We explored a number of different strategies to cluster protein space in order to find the number of families representing these 48% of structurally unknown proteins. For the subset of all entirely sequencedeukaryotes, we found over 18 000 fragment clusters each of which may be a suitable target for structural genomics.Availability: All data are available from the authors, most resultsare summarized at:http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/genomes/RES/2002_bioinformatics/Contact:rost@columbia.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000176911100004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/7/922/256470/Target-space-for-structural-genomics-revisited	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.7.922	NULL	http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/genomes/RES/2002_bioinformatics/,http://rost@columbia.edu	NULL	NULL

With the emergence of structural proteomics projects, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to select protein targets for structuralstudies that will appropriately cover the space of protein sequences, functions and genomic distribution.These problems are the motivation for the development of methods forclustering protein sequences and building families of potentiallyorthologous sequences, such as those proposed here.Results: First we developed a clustering strategy (Ncut algorithm) capable of forming groups of related sequences by assessing their pairwise relationships. The results presented for the ras super-family of proteins are similar to those produced by other clustering methods, but without the need for clustering the full sequence space. The Ncut clusters are then used as the input to a process of reconstruction of groups with equilibrated genomic composition formed by closely-related sequences.

In anattempt to address this problem we mapped over 10 000 proteins with solvedstructures onto a graph of all Swissprot protein sequences (release 36,∼73 000 proteins) provided by ProtoMap, with the goal of sortingproteins according to their likelihood of belonging to new superfamilies. Wehypothesized that proteins within neighbouring clusters tend to share commonstructural superfamilies or folds. If true, the likelihood of finding newsuperfamilies increases in clusters that are distal from other solvedstructures within the graph.Results: We defined an order relation between unsolvedproteins according to their ‘distance’ from solved structures in the graph,and sorted ∼48 000 proteins. Our list can be partitioned into threegroups: ∼35 000 proteins sharing a cluster with at least one knownstructure;∼6500 proteins in clusters with no solved structure butwith neighbouring clusters containing known structures; and a third groupcontains the rest of the proteins, ∼6100 (in 1274 clusters). We testedthe quality of the order relation using thousands of recently solvedstructures that were not included when the order was defined. The tests showthat our order is significantly better (P-value ∼105) thana random order. More interestingly, the order within the union of the secondand third groups, and the order within the third group alone, perform betterthan random (P-values: 0.0008 and 0.15, respectively) and are better thanalternative orders created using PSI-BLAST.

Support vector regression is a statistical method for creating regression functions of arbitrary type from a set of training data. The training set is composed of embryos for which the precise developmental age was determined by measuring the degree of membrane invagination. Testing the quality of regression on the training set showed good prediction accuracy. The optimal regression function was then used for the prediction of the gene expression based age of embryos in which the precise age has not been measured by membrane morphology. Moreover, we show that the same accuracy of prediction can be achieved when the dimensionality of the feature vector was reduced by applying factor analysis. The data reduction allowed us to avoid over-fitting and to increase the efficiency of the algorithm.Availability: This software may be obtained from the authors.Contact:samson@fn.csa.ruKeywords: gene expression patterns; development; embryo staging; support vector regression; segmentation genes;Drosophila.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS87%2f231865	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S87/231865/Support-vector-regression-applied-to-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S87	NULL	http://samson@fn.csa.ru	NULL	NULL

In light of the recent progress instructure determination methodology, this number is likely to increaserapidly. A novel method is presented here: ‘Rate4Site’, which maps therate of evolution among homologous proteins onto the molecular surface ofone of the homologues whose 3D-structure is known. Functionally importantregions often correspond to surface patches of slowly evolving residues.Results: Rate4Site estimates the rate of evolution of amino acid sites usingthe maximum likelihood (ML) principle.

In contrast, information about thesub-cellular localization is available for only a few proteins. Experts canoften infer localization from keywords describing protein function. Wedeveloped LOCkey, a fully automated method for lexical analysis ofSWISS-PROT keywords that assigns sub-cellular localization. With the rapidgrowth in sequence data, the biochemical characterisation of sequences hasbeen falling behind. Our method may be a useful tool for supplementingfunctional information already automatically available.Results: The method reached a level of more than 82% accuracy in a fullcross-validation test. Due to a lack of functional annotations, we couldinfer localization for fewer than half of all proteins in SWISS-PROT. Weapplied LOCkey to annotate five entirely sequenced proteomes, namelySaccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast),Caenorhabditis elegans(worm),Drosophila melanogaster(fly),Arabidopsis thaliana(plant) and a subset of all human proteins.LOCkey found about 8000 new annotations of sub-cellular localization forthese eukaryotes.Availability: Annotations of localization for eukaryotes at:http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/services/LOCkeyContact:nair@cubic.bioc.coplumbia.edurost@columbia.eduKeywords: genome sequence analysis; predicting sub-cellular localization; protein function; lexical analysis.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS78%2f231833	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S78/231833/Inferring-sub-cellular-localization-through	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S78	NULL	http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/services/LOCkey,http://nair@cubic.bioc.coplumbia.edu,http://rost@columbia.edu	NULL	NULL

Baldi	NULL	Motivation: Accurate prediction of protein contact maps is an important step in computational structural proteomics. Because contact maps provide a translation and rotation invariant topological representation of a protein, they can be used as a fundamental intermediary step in protein structure prediction.Results: We develop a new set of flexible machine learning architectures for the prediction of contact maps, as well as other information processing and pattern recognition tasks. The architectures can be viewed as recurrent neural network implemantations of a class of Bayesian networks we call generalized input-output HMMs (GIOHMMs).For the specific case of contact maps, contextual information is propagated laterally through four hidden planes, one for each cardinal corner. We show that these architectures can be trained from examples and yield contact map predictors that outperform previously reported methods. While several extensions and improvements are in progress, the current version can accurately predict 60.5% of contacts at a distance cutoff of 8 Å and 45% of distant contacts at 10 Å, for proteins of length up to 300.Availability: The contact map predictor will be made available throughhttp://promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/as part of an existing suite of proteomics predictors.Contact:gpollast@ics.uci.edupfbaldi@ics.uci.eduKeywords: protein structure prediction; protein contacts, contact map; graphical models; recurrent neural networks.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS62%2f231801	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S62/231801/Prediction-of-contact-maps-by-GIOHMMs-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S62	NULL	http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/,http://gpollast@ics.uci.edu,http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu	NULL	NULL

Theseestimates are mainly computed on the basis of sequence comparison andmembrane protein prediction. It is therefore urgent to develop methodscapable of selecting membrane proteins especially in the case of outermembrane proteins, barely taken into consideration when proteome wideanalysis is performed. This will also help protein annotation when nohomologous sequence is found in the database. Outer membrane proteins solvedso far at atomic resolution interact with the external membrane of bacteriawith a characteristic β barrel structure comprising different evennumbers of β strands (β barrel membrane proteins). In thisthey differ from the membrane proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane endowedwith alpha helix bundles (all alpha membrane proteins) and need specialisedpredictors.Results: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology ofβ barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information.The model is cyclic with 6 types of states: two for the β strandtransmembrane core, one for the β strand cap on either side of themembrane, one for the inner loop, one for the outer loop and one for theglobular domain state in the middle of each loop. The development of aspecific input for HMM based on multiple sequence alignment is novel. Theaccuracy per residue of the model is 83% when a jack knife procedure isadopted. With a model optimisation method using a dynamic programmingalgorithm seven topological models out of the twelve proteins included inthe testing set are also correctly predicted. When used as adiscriminator, the model is rather selective. At a fixed probability value,it retains 84% of a non-redundant set comprising 145 sequences ofwell-annotated outer membrane proteins. Concomitantly, it correctly rejects90% of a set of globular proteins including about 1200 chains with lowsequence identity (<30%) and 90% of a set of all alpha membraneproteins, including 188 chains.Availability:The program will be available on request from theauthors.Contact:gigi@lipid.biocomp.unibo.ithttp://www.biocomp.unibo.itKeywords: β barrel membrane proteins; HMM; genome analysis; protein structure prediction; outer membrane protein topology.3Present address: Bioinformatics Centre, University of Copenhagen, DK-2100Copenhagen, Denmark*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS46%2f231771	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S46/231771/A-sequence-profile-based-HMM-for-predicting-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S46	NULL	http://gigi@lipid.biocomp.unibo.it,http://www.biocomp.unibo.it	NULL	NULL

Pevzner	NULL	Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology with important applications in finding regulatory signals. Current approaches to pattern discovery focus onmonadpatterns that correspond to relatively short contiguous strings.However, many of the actual regulatory signals arecompositepatterns that are groups of monad patterns that occur near each other.A difficulty in discovering composite patterns is that one or both of the component monad patterns in the group may be ‘too weak’.Since the traditional monad-based motif finding algorithms usually output one (or a few) high scoring patterns, they often fail to find composite regulatory signals consisting of weak monad parts. In this paper, we present aMITRA (MIsmatch TRee Algorithm)approach for discovering composite signals.

Though several methodshave been devised to predict operons, most need a high characterization ofthe genome analysed. Log-likelihoods derived from inter-genic distancedistributions work surprisingly well to predict operons inEscherichia coliand areavailable for any genome as soon as the gene sets are predicted.Results: Here we provide evidence that the very same method isapplicable to any prokaryotic genome. First, the method has the sameefficiency when evaluated using a collection of experimentally known operonsofBacillus subtilis. Second, operons among most if not all prokaryotes seem to have the sametendencies to keep short distances between their genes, the most frequentdistances being the overlaps of four and one base pairs. The universality ofthis structural feature allows us to predict the organization oftranscription units in all prokaryotes.

In the sense of graph theory, a drawing of RNAsecondary structures is a tree, whereas a drawing of RNA pseudoknots is agraph with inner cycles within a pseudoknot as well as possible outer cyclesformed between a pseudoknot and other structural elements. Thus, RNApseudoknots are more difficult to visualize than RNA secondary structures.Since no automatic method for drawing RNA pseudoknots exists, visualizingRNA pseudoknots relies on significant amount of manual work and does notyield satisfactory results. The task of visualizing RNA pseudoknots by handbecomes more challenging as the size and complexity of the RNA pseudoknotsincrease.Results: We have developed a new representation and analgorithm for drawing H-type pseudoknots with RNA secondary structures.Compared to existing representations of H-type pseudoknots, the newrepresentation ensures uniform and clear drawings with no edge crossing forany H-type pseudoknots. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstalgorithm for automatically drawing RNA pseudoknots with RNA secondarystructures. The algorithm has been implemented in a Java program, which canbe executed on any computing system. Experimental results demonstrate thatthe algorithm generates an aesthetically pleasing drawing of all H-typepseudoknots.

If such an underlyingframework is provided, all the basic questions in the area can be posed in abiologically more appropriate and useful form: e.g.,the similarity betweentwo genomes can then be computed via the nearest ancestor, rather than‘directly’, ignoring the evolutionary connections.Results: We outline an evolution-based general framework foranswering questions related to the multiple genome rearrangement. In theproposed model, the evolutionary genome graph (EG-graph) encapsulates anevolutionary history of a genome family. For a set of all EG-graphs, weintroduce a family of similarity measures, each defined via a fixed set of genometransformations. Given a set ofgenomes and restricting ourselves to the transpositions, an algorithm forconstructing an EG-graph is presented. We also present the experimentalresults in the form of an EG-graph for a set of concrete genomes (forseveral species). This EG-graph turns out to be very close to thecorresponding known phylogenetic tree.Contact:dkorkin@unb.caKeywords: genome rearrangement; evolutionary model; gene transformations; longest common subsequence; ETS framework.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS303%2f232269	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S303/232269/Multiple-genome-rearrangement-a-general-approach	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S303	NULL	http://dkorkin@unb.ca	NULL	NULL

          assembly process"	http://daniel.fasulo@celera.com	ORIGINAL PAPER	17	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Daniel Fasulo,Aaron Halpern,Ian Dew,Clark Mobarry	NULL	Motivation: Current genomic sequence assemblers assume that the input data is derived from a single, homogeneous source.However, recent whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects have violated this assumption, resulting in input fragments covering the same region of the genome whose sequences differ due to polymorphic variation in the population.While single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not pose a significant problem to state-of-the-art assembly methods, these methods do not handle insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms of more than a few bases.Results: This paper describes an efficient method for detecting sequence discrepencies due to polymorphism that avoids resorting to global use of more costly, less stringent affine sequence alignments. Instead, the algorithm uses graph-based methods to determine the small set of fragments involved in each polymorphism and performs more sophisticated alignments only among fragments in that set. Results from the incorporation of this method into the Celera Assembler are reported for theD.melanogaster,H. sapiens, andM. musculusgenomes.Availability: The method described herein does not constitute a stand-alone softwareapplication, but is laid out in sufficient detail to be implementedas a component of any genomic sequence assembler.Contact:daniel.fasulo@celera.comKeywords: whole-genome assembly; shotgun sequencing; polymorphism.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS294%2f232255	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S294/232255/Efficiently-detecting-polymorphisms-during-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S294	NULL	http://daniel.fasulo@celera.com	NULL	NULL

Biologists resolve the conflict by computing the consensus of these trees. Single-tree consensus as postprocessing methods can be unsatisfactory due to their inherent limitations.Results: In this paper we present an alternative approach by using clustering algorithms on the set of candidate trees. We propose bicriterion problems, in particular using the concept of information loss, and new consensus trees calledcharacteristic treesthat minimize the information loss. Our empirical study using four biological datasets shows that our approach provides a significant improvement in the information content, while adding only a small amountof complexity.Furthermore, the consensus trees we obtain for each of our large clusters are more resolved than the single-tree consensus trees.We also provide some initial progress on theoretical questions that arise in this context.Availability: Software available upon request from the authors.

676	A tree kernel to analyse phylogenetic profiles	http://Jean-Philippe.Vert@mines.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	33	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jean-Philippe Vert	NULL	Motivation: The phylogenetic profile of a protein is a string that encodes the presence or absence of the protein in every fully sequenced genome. Because proteins that participate in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion, the phylogenetic profiles of such proteins are often ‘similar’ or at least ‘related’ to each other. The question we address in this paper is the following: how to measure the ‘similarity’ between two profiles, in an evolutionarily relevant way, in order to develop efficient function prediction methods?Results: We show how the profiles can be mapped to a high-dimensional vector space which incorporates evolutionarily relevant information, and we provide an algorithm to compute efficiently the inner product in that space, which we call the tree kernel. The tree kernel can be used by any kernel-based analysis method for classification or data mining of phylogenetic profiles.As an application a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained to predict the functional class of a gene from its phylogenetic profile is shown to perform better with the tree kernel than with a naive kernel that does not include any information about the phylogenetic relationships among species. Moreover a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of the phylogenetic profilesillustrates the sensitivity of the tree kernel to evolutionarily relevant variations.Availability: All data and software used are freely and publicly available upon request.Contact:Jean-Philippe.Vert@mines.orgKeywords: phylogenetic profile; tree; kernel; support vector machine; gene function prediction.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS276%2f232228	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S276/232228/A-tree-kernel-to-analyse-phylogenetic-profiles	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S276	NULL	http://Jean-Philippe.Vert@mines.org	NULL	NULL

Several works have been done to derive kernelsfrom probability distributions, e.g., the Fisher kernel. However, a general methodology to design a kernel is not fully developed.Results: We propose a reasonable way of designing a kernelwhen objects are generated from latent variable models (e.g., HMM). First of all, ajointkernel is designed for complete data which include both visible and hidden variables. Then amarginalizedkernel for visible data is obtainedby taking the expectation with respect to hidden variables. We will show that the Fisher kernel is a special case of marginalized kernels, which gives another viewpoint to the Fisher kernel theory. Although our approach can be applied to any object, we particularly derive several marginalized kernels useful for biological sequences (e.g.,DNA and proteins). The effectiveness of marginalized kernelsis illustrated in the task of classifying bacterial gyrase subunit B (gyrB) amino acid sequences.Contact:koji.tsuda@aist.go.jpKeywords: kernel design; marginalized kernels; the Fisher kernel; biological sequence classification; string kernels.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS268%2f232208	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S268/232208/Marginalized-kernels-for-biological-sequences	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S268	NULL	http://koji.tsuda@aist.go.jp	NULL	NULL

Gomez,George Hripcsak,Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou,Carol Friedman,Andrey Rzhetsky	NULL	Motivation: Knowledge on interactions between molecules in living cells is indispensable for theoretical analysis and practical applications in modern genomics and molecular biology. Building such networks relies on the assumption that the correct molecular interactions are known or can be identified by reading a few research articles. However, this assumption does not necessarly hold, as truth is rather an emerging property based on many potentially conflicting facts. This paper explores the processes of knowledge generation and publishing in the molecular biology literature using modelling and analysis of real molecular interaction data.The data analysed in this article were automatically extracted from 50000 research articles in molecular biology using a computer system called GeneWays containing a natural language processing module. The paper indicates that truthfulness of statements is associated in the minds of scientists with the relative importance (connectedness) of substances under study, revealing a potential selection bias in the reporting of research results. Aiming at understanding the statistical properties of the life cycle of biological facts reported in research articles, we formulate a stochastic model describing generation and propagation of knowledge about molecular interactions through scientific publications. We hope that in the future such a model can be useful for automatically producing consensus views of molecular interaction data.Contact:ar345@columbia.eduKeywords: statistical modelling; scientometric analysis; molecular interaction data; natural language processing	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS249%2f232182	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S249/232182/Of-truth-and-pathways-chasing-bits-of-information	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S249	NULL	http://ar345@columbia.edu	NULL	NULL

Siegel	NULL	Motivation: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases ofprotein–protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremelyimportant resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and generegulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating theseinteractions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible togenerate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing theobserved changes in gene expression. To perform this integrationsystematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening amolecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e.,connectedregions of the network that show significant changes in expression overparticular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines arigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithmfor identifying subnetworks with high score.Results: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462protein–protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases.In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworksthat covered 41 out of 77 (53%) of all significant changes in expression.Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with goodcorrespondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature.

Lathrop	NULL	Motivation: Direct recognition, or direct readout, of DNA bases by a DNA-binding protein involves amino acids that interact directly with features specific to each base.Experimental evidence also shows that in many cases the protein achieves partial sequence specificity by indirect recognition, i.e., by recognizing structural properties of the DNA.(1) Could threading a DNA sequence onto a crystal structure of bound DNA help explain the indirect recognition component of sequence specificity? (2) Might the resulting pure-structure computational motif manifest itself in familiar sequence-based computational motifs?Results: The starting structure motif was a crystal structure of DNA bound to the integration host factor protein (IHF) ofE. coli.IHF is known to exhibit both direct and indirect recognition of its binding sites.(1) Threading DNA sequences onto the crystal structure showed statistically significant partial separation of 60 IHF binding sites from random and intragenic sequences and was positively correlated with binding affinity.(2) The crystal structure was shown to be equivalent to a linear Markov network, and so, to a joint probability distribution over sequences, computable in linear time.It was transformed algorithmically into several common pure-sequence representations, including (a) small sets of short exact strings, (b) weight matrices, (c) consensus regular patterns, (d) multiple sequence alignments, and (e) phylogenetic trees.In all cases the pure-sequence motifs retained statistically significant partial separation of the IHF binding sites from random and intragenic sequences.Most exhibited positive correlation with binding affinity. The multiple alignment showed some conserved columns, and the phylogenetic tree partially mixed low-energy sequences with IHF binding sites but separated high-energy sequences.The conclusion is that deformation energy explains part of indirect recognition, which explains part of IHF sequence-specific binding.Availability: Code and data on request.Contact:Nick Steffen for code and Lorenzo Tolleri for data.nsteffen@uci.eduLorenzo_Tolleri@chiron.itKeywords: protein-DNA binding sites; sequence motifs or patterns; indirect recognition or readout; integration host factor; IHF.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS22%2f231726	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S22/231726/DNA-sequence-and-structure-direct-and-indirect	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S22	NULL	http://nsteffen@uci.edu,http://Lorenzo_Tolleri@chiron.it	NULL	NULL

Hartemink	NULL	Motivation: Although many network inference algorithms have been presented in the bioinformatics literature, no suitable approach has been formulated for evaluating their effectiveness at recovering models of complex biological systems from limited data.To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to evaluate network inference algorithms according to their ability to recover a complex functional network from biologically reasonable simulated data.Results: We designed a simulator to generate data representing a complex biological system at multiple levels of organization: behaviour, neural anatomy, brain electrophysiology, and gene expression of songbirds. About 90% of the simulated variables are unregulated by other variables in the system and are included simply as distracters.We sampled the simulated data at intervals as one would sample from a biological system in practice, and then used the sampled data to evaluate the effectiveness of an algorithm we developed for functional network inference.We found that our algorithm is highly effective at recovering the functional network structure of the simulated system—including the irrelevance of unregulated variables—from sampled data alone.To assess the reproducibility of these results, we tested our inference algorithm on 50 separately simulated sets of data and it consistently recovered almost perfectly the complex functional network structure underlying the simulated data.To our knowledge, this is the first approach for evaluating the effectiveness of functional network inference algorithms at recovering models from limited data.Our simulation approach also enables researchersa priorito design experiments and data-collection protocols that are amenable to functional network inference.Availability: Source code and simulated data are available upon request.Contact:amink@cs.duke.eduasmith@neuro.duke.edujarvis@neuro.duke.edu	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS216%2f232121	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S216/232121/Evaluating-functional-network-inference-using	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S216	NULL	http://amink@cs.duke.edu,http://asmith@neuro.duke.edu,http://jarvis@neuro.duke.edu	NULL	NULL

Still, new measuring methods are needed to obtain more reliable, quantitative data about transcription on a genomic scale. In this paper we concentrate on certain computational optimization problems arising in the design of one such novel method. From a computational point of view the key feature of the new method is that the hybridized probes are distinguished from each other based on their different size. Therefore the probes have to be assigned into pools such that the probes in the same pool have unique sizes different enough from each other. Identification of expressed RNA is given by probe pool and probe size while quantification is given by the label of the probe, e.g. fluorescence intensity.Results: We show how to computationally find the probes and assign them into pools for a whole genome such that (i) each gene has a specific probe suitable for amplification and hybridization, and (ii) the expression level measurement can be done in a minimal number of pools separable by electrophoresis in order to minimize the total experiment cost of the measurement.

Pevzner	NULL	Motivation: The traditional approach to annotate alternative splicing is to investigate every splicing variant of the gene in a case-by-case fashion. This approach, while useful, has some serious shortcomings. Recent studies indicate that alternative splicing is more frequent than previously thought and some genes may produce tens of thousands of different transcripts. A list of alternatively spliced variants for such genes would be difficult to build and hard to analyse. Moreover, such a list does not show the relationships between different transcripts and does not show the overall structure of all transcripts. A better approach would be to represent allsplicing variants for a given gene in a way that captures the relationships between different splicing variants.Results: We introduce the notion of thesplicing graphthat is a natural and convenient representation of all splicing variants. The key difference with the existing approaches is that we abandon the linear (sequence) representation of each transcript and replace it with a graph representation where each transcript corresponds to a path in the graph. We further design an algorithm to assemble EST reads into the splicing graph rather than assembling them into each splicing variant in a case-by-case fashion.Availability:http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/bioinformatics/software.htmlContact:sheber@ucsd.eduKeywords: EST assembly; splicing graph; alternative splicing	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS181%2f232062	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S181/232062/Splicing-graphs-and-EST-assembly-problem	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S181	NULL	http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/bioinformatics/software.html,http://sheber@ucsd.edu	NULL	NULL

Thedegeneracyof the primer is the number of unique sequence combinations it contains. We study the problem of designing a pair of primers with prescribed degeneracy that match a maximum number of given input sequences. Such problems occur when studying a family of genes that is known only in part, or is known in a related species. We prove that various simplified versions of the problem are hard, show the polynomiality of some restricted cases, and develop approximation algorithms for one variant. Based on these algorithms, we implemented a program calledhydenfor designing highly-degenerate primers for a set of genomic sequences. We report on the success of the program in an experimental scheme for identifying all human olfactory receptor (OR) genes. In that project,hydenwas used to design primers with degeneracies up to 1010that amplified with high specificity many novel genes of that family, tripling the number of OR genes known at the time.Availability: Available on request from the authors.Contact:chaiml@tau.ac.il;rshamir@tau.ac.ilKeywords: PCR primer design; degenerate primers; optimization; human olfactory subgenome; protein families.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS172%2f232047	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S172/232047/The-degenerate-primer-design-problem	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S172	NULL	http://chaiml@tau.ac.il,http://rshamir@tau.ac.il	NULL	NULL

selection for gene-expression arrays"	http://molla@cs.wisc.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	14	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	J. B. Tobler,M.N. Molla,E.F. Nuwaysir,R.D. Green,J.W. Shavlik	NULL	Motivation: Microarrays are a fast and cost-effective method of performingthousands of DNA hybridization experiments simultaneously. DNA probes aretypically used to measure the expression level of specific genes. Becauseprobes greatly vary in the quality of their hybridizations, choosing goodprobes is a difficult task. If one could accurately choose probes that arelikely to hybridize well, then fewer probes would be needed to representeach gene in a gene-expression microarray, and, hence, more genes could beplaced on an array of a given physical size. Our goal is to empiricallyevaluate how successfully three standard machine-learning algorithms—naïve Bayes, decision trees, and artificial neural networks—can beapplied to the task of predicting good probes. Fortunately it is relativelyeasy to get training examples for such a learning task: place various probeson a gene chip, add a sample where the corresponding genes are highlyexpressed, and then record how well each probe measures the presence of itscorresponding gene. With such training examples, it is possible that anaccurate predictor of probe quality can be learned.Results: Two of the learning algorithms we investigate—naïve Bayesand neural networks—learn to predict probe quality surprisingly well. Forexample, in the top ten predicted probes for a given gene not used fortraining, on average about five rank in the top 2.5% of that gene'shundreds of possible probes. Decision-tree induction and the simple approachof using predicted melting temperature to rank probes perform significantlyworse than these two algorithms. The features we use to represent probes arevery easily computed and the time taken to score each candidate probe aftertraining is minor. Training the naïve Bayes algorithm takes very littletime, and while it takes over 10 times as long to train a neural network,that time is still not very substantial (on the order of a few hours on adesktop workstation). We also report the information contained in thefeatures we use to describe the probes. We find the fraction of cytosine inthe probe to be the most informative feature. We also find, notsurprisingly, that the nucleotides in the middle of the probes sequence aremore informative than those at the ends of the sequence.Contact:molla@cs.wisc.eduKeywords: microarrays; probe selection; artificial neural networks; decision trees; naïve Bayes.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS164%2f232030	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S164/232030/Evaluating-machine-learning-approaches-for-aiding	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S164	NULL	http://molla@cs.wisc.edu	NULL	NULL

In particular systematic changes in experimental conditions across multiple chips can seriously affect quality and even lead to false biological conclusions. Traditionally the influence of these effects can be minimized only by expensive repeated measurements, because a detailed understanding of all process relevant parameters seems impossible.Results: We introduce a novel method for microarray process control that estimates qualitybased solely on the distribution of the actual measurements without requiring repeated experiments. A robust version of principle component analysis detects single outlier microarrays and thereby enables the use of techniques from multivariate statistical process control. In particular, theT2control chart reliably tracks undesired changes in process relevant parameters. This can be used to improve the microarray process itself, limits necessary repetitions to only affected samples and therefore maintains quality in a cost effective way. We prove the power of the approach on 3 large sets of DNA methylation microarray data.Contact:Fabian.Model@epigenomics.comKeywords: DNA methylation; robust PCA; micorarray; statistical process control; quality control.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS155%2f232013	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S155/232013/Statistical-process-control-for-large-scale	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S155	NULL	http://Fabian.Model@epigenomics.com	NULL	NULL

The use of this additional information promises to improve exploratory analysis considerably.Results: We propose constructing a distance function which combines information from expression data and biological networks. Based on this function, we compute a joint clustering of genes and vertices of the network. This general approach is elaborated for metabolic networks. We define a graph distance function on such networks and combine it with a correlation-based distance function for gene expression measurements. A hierarchical clustering and an associated statistical measure is computed to arrive at a reasonable number of clusters. Our method is validated using expression data of the yeast diauxic shift. The resulting clusters are easily interpretable in terms of the biochemical network and the gene expression data and suggest that our method is able to automatically identify processes that are relevant under the measured conditions.Contact:Daniel.Hanisch@scai.fhg.deKeywords: gene expression; biological networks; metabolic networks; co-clustering; clustering.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS145%2f232002	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S145/232002/Co-clustering-of-biological-networks-and-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S145	NULL	http://Daniel.Hanisch@scai.fhg.de	NULL	NULL

One of the currentmajor challenges in bioinformatics is to extend our knowledge to verylarge sets of proteins. Several major projects have tackled this problem.Such undertakings usually start with a process that clusters all knownproteins or large subsets of this space. Some work in this area is carriedout automatically, while other attempts incorporate expert advice andannotation.Results: We propose a novel technique that automatically clusters protein sequences. We consider all proteins in SWISSPROT, and carry out anall-against-all BLAST similarity test among them. With this similaritymeasure in hand we proceed to perform a continuous bottom-up clusteringprocess by applying alternative rules for merging clusters. The outcome ofthis clustering process is a classification of the input proteins into ahierarchy of clusters of varying degrees of granularity. Here we compare theclusters that result from alternative merging rules, and validate theresults against InterPro.Our preliminary results show that clusters that are consistent with severalrather than a single merging rule tend to comply with InterPro annotation.This is an affirmation of the view that the protein space consists offamilies that differ markedly in their evolutionary conservation.Availability: The outcome of these investigations can be viewed inan interactive Web site athttp://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.ilSupplementary information: Biological examples for comparing theperformance of the different algorithms used for classification arepresented inhttp://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/examples.htmlContact:ori@cs.huji.ac.ilKeywords: protein families; protein classification; sequence alignment; clustering.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS14%2f231711	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S14/231711/The-metric-space-of-proteins-comparative-study-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S14	NULL	http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il,http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/examples.html,http://ori@cs.huji.ac.il	NULL	NULL

We propose a new method to detect significant biclusters in large expression datasets. Our approach is graph theoretic coupled with statistical modelling of the data. Under plausible assumptions, our algorithm is polynomial and is guaranteed to find the most significant biclusters. We tested our method on a collection of yeast expression profiles and on a human cancer dataset. Cross validation results show high specificity in assigning function to genes based on their biclusters, and we are able to annotate in this way 196 uncharacterized yeast genes. We also demonstrate how the biclusters lead to detecting new concrete biological associations. In cancer data we are able to detect and relate finer tissue types than was previously possible.

Skiena	NULL	A substantial percentage of the expense in constructing full-genome spotted microarrays comes from the cost of synthesizing the PCR primers to amplify the desired DNA. We propose a computationally-based method to substantially reduce this cost. Historically, PCR primers are designed so that each primer occurs uniquely in the genome. This condition is unnecessarily strong for selective amplification, since only theprimer pairassociated with each amplification need be unique. We demonstrate that careful design in a genome-level amplification project permits us to save the cost of several thousand primers over conventional approaches.Contact:skiena@cs.sunysb.edu;rohan@cs.sunysb.eduKeywords: PCR; primer design; microarray synthesis.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS128%2f231967	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S128/231967/Microarray-synthesis-through-multiple-use-PCR	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S128	NULL	http://skiena@cs.sunysb.edu,http://rohan@cs.sunysb.edu	NULL	NULL

Kohane	NULL	There is an increasing need to link the large amount of genotypicdata, gathered using microarrays for example, with various phenotypicdata from patients.The classification problem in which geneexpression data serve as predictors and a class label phenotype as thebinary outcome variable has been examined extensively, but there hasbeen less emphasis in dealing with other types of phenotypic data.Inparticular, patient survival times with censoring are often not useddirectly as a response variable due to the complications that arisefrom censoring.We show that the issues involving censored data can be circumvented by reformulating the problem as a standard Poisson regression problem. The procedure for solving the transformed problem is a combination of two approaches: partial least squares, a regression technique that is especially effective when there is severe collinearity due to a large number of predictors, and generalized linear regression, which extends standard linear regression to deal with various types of response variables.The linear combinations of the original variables identified by the method are highly correlated with the patient survival times and at the same time account for the variability in the covariates.The algorithm is fast, as it does not involve any matrix decompositions in the iterations.We apply our method to data sets from lung carcinoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma studies to verify its effectiveness.Contact:peter_park@harvard.eduKeywords: microarrays; generalized linear models; survivial analysis; Poisson regression; principal components analysis.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS120%2f231951	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S120/231951/Linking-gene-expression-data-with-patient-survival	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S120	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Sultan,D.A. Wigle,C.A. Cumbaa,M. Maziarz,J. Glasgow,M.S. Tsao,I. Jurisica	NULL	Motivation: With the increasing number of gene expression databases, the need for more powerful analysis and visualization tools is growing. Many techniques have successfully been applied to unravel latent similarities among genes and/or experiments. Most of the current systems for microarray data analysis use statistical methods, hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, support vector machines, ork-means clustering to organize genes or experiments into ‘meaningful’ groups. Without prior explicit bias almost all of these clustering methods applied to gene expression data not only produce different results, but may also produce clusters with little or no biological relevance. Of these methods, agglomerative hierarchical clustering has been the most widely applied, although many limitations have been identified.Results: Starting with a systematic comparison of the underlying theories behind clustering approaches, we have devised a technique that combines tree-structured vector quantization and partitivek-means clustering (BTSVQ). This hybrid technique has revealed clinicallyrelevant clusters in three large publicly available data sets. In contrast to existing systems, our approach is less sensitive to data preprocessing and data normalization. In addition, the clustering results produced by the technique have strong similarities to those of self-organizing maps (SOMs). We discuss the advantages and the mathematical reasoning behind our approach.Availability: The BTSVQ system is implemented in Matlab R12 using the SOM toolbox for the visualization and preprocessing of the datahttp://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/BTSVQ is available for non-commercial usehttp://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ta3/BTSVQContact:ij@uhnres.utoronto.caKeywords: microarray data clustering and visulization; self-organizing maps, partitivek-means clustering; lung cancer.	2002-07-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_1%2fS111%2f231929	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_1/S111/231929/Binary-tree-structured-vector-quantization	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.S111	NULL	http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/,http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ta3/BTSVQ,http://ij@uhnres.utoronto.ca	NULL	NULL

John Wilbur	NULL	Motivation: The MEDLINE database of biomedical abstracts containsscientific knowledge about thousands of interacting genes and proteins.Automated text processing can aid in the comprehension and synthesis of thisvaluable information. The fundamental task of identifying gene and proteinnames is a necessary first step towards making full use of the informationencoded in biomedical text. This remains a challenging task due to theirregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature. We proposeto approach the detection of gene and protein names in scientific abstractsas part-of-speech tagging, the most basic form of linguistic corpus annotation.Results: We present a method for tagging gene and protein names inbiomedical text using a combination of statistical and knowledge-basedstrategies. This method incorporates automatically generated rules from atransformation-based part-of-speech tagger, and manuallygenerated rules from morphological clues, low frequency trigrams, indicatorterms, suffixes and part-of-speech information.

The cell differentially separates Golgi residentproteins from proteins that move through the organelle to other subcellulardestinations. We set out to determine if we could distinguish these twotypes of transmembrane proteins using computational approaches.Results: A new method has been developed to predict Golgi membrane proteins based ontheir transmembrane domains. To establish the prediction procedure, we tookthe hydrophobicity values and frequencies of different residues within thetransmembrane domains into consideration. A simple linear discriminantfunction was developed with a small number of parameters derived from adataset of Type II transmembrane proteins of known localization.

In a number of circumstances simplified alphabets (where one or more letters would be represented by the same symbol) have proved their potential utility in several fields of bioinformatics including searching for patterns occurring at an unexpected rate, studying protein folding and finding consensus sequences in multiple alignments. The main issue addressed in this paper is the possibility of finding a general approach that would allow an exhaustive analysis of all the possible simplified alphabets, using substitution matrices like PAM and BLOSUM as a measure for scoring.Results: The computational approach presented in this paper has led to a computer program called AlphaSimp (Alphabet Simplifier) that can perform an exhaustive analysis of the possible simplified amino acid alphabets, using a branch and bound algorithm together with standard or user-defined substitution matrices. The program returns a ranked list of the highest-scoring simplified alphabets. When the extent of the simplification is limited and the simplified alphabets are maintained above ten symbols the program is able to complete the analysis in minutes or even seconds on a personal computer.

Schmitt,Jatin Misra,George Stephanopoulos	NULL	Motivation: The increasing use of DNA microarrays to probe cell physiologyrequires methods for visualizing different expression phenotypes andexplicitly connecting individual genes to discriminating expressionfeatures. Such methods should be robust and maintain biologicalinterpretability.Results: We propose a method for the mapping of the physiological state ofcells and tissues from multidimensional expression data such as thoseobtained with DNA microarrays. The method uses Fisher discriminant analysisto create a linear projection of gene expression measurements that maximizesthe separation of different sample classes. Relative to other typicalclassification methods, this method provides insights into thediscriminating characteristics of expression measurements in terms of thecontribution of individual genes to the definition of distinct physiologicalstates.

Shah,Michael C. Giddings,Jasmin B. Parvaz,Raymond F. Gesteland,John F. Atkins,Ivaylo P. Ivanov	NULL	Motivation: In an effort to identify potential programmedframeshift sites by statistical analysis, we explore the hypothesis thatselective pressure would have rendered such sites underabundant andunderrepresented in protein-coding sequences. We developed a computerprogram to compare the frequencies of k-length subsequences of nucleotideswith the frequencies predicted by a zero order Markov chain determined by the codon bias of the same set of sequences.The program was used tocalculate and evaluate the distribution of 7-base oligonucleotides in the6000+ putative protein-coding sequences ofS. cerevisiaepreliminary to the laboratorytesting of the most highly underrepresented oligos for frameshiftingefficiency.Results: Among the most significant results is thefinding that the heptanucleotides CUU-AGG-C and CUU-AGU-U, sites of theprogrammed +1 translational frameshifts required for the production in yeastof actin filament-binding protein ABP140 and telomerase subunit EST3,respectively, rank among the least represented of phase I heptanucleotidesin the coding sequences ofS. cerevisiae. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that otherunderrepresented heptanucleotides identified by the program, for exampleGGU-CAG-A, are also prone to significant translational frameshifting,suggesting the possibility that genes containing other underrepresentedheptamers may also encode transframe products.Availability: The program is available for download fromhttp://www.gesteland.genetics.utah.edu/freqAnalysisContact:ivaylo.ivanov@m.cc.utah.eduSupplementary Information: Complete results from theanalysis ofS. cerevisiaeare available onhttp://www.gesteland.genetics.utah.edu/freqAnalysis*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.2Present address: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at ChapelHill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.	2002-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000177504400003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/8/1046/232955/Computational-identification-of-putative	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.8.1046	NULL	http://www.gesteland.genetics.utah.edu/freqAnalysis,http://ivaylo.ivanov@m.cc.utah.edu,http://www.gesteland.genetics.utah.edu/freqAnalysis	NULL	NULL
720	"Improving gene recognition accuracy by combining
predictions from two  gene-finding programs"	http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/genefinding/,http://rogic@cse.ucsc.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	7	30	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Sanja Rogic,B.F. Francis Ouellette,Alan K. Mackworth	NULL	Motivation: Despite constant improvements in prediction accuracy,gene-finding programs are still unable to provide automatic gene discoverywith desired correctness. The current programs can identify up to 75% ofexons correctly and less than 50% of predicted gene structures correspondto actual genes. New approaches to computational gene-finding are clearlyneeded.Results: In this paper we have explored the benefits of combiningpredictions from already existing gene prediction programs. We haveintroduced three novel methods for combining predictions from programsGenscan and HMMgene. The methods primarily aim to improve exon levelaccuracy of gene-finding by identifying more probable exon boundaries and byeliminating false positive exon predictions. This approach results inimproved accuracy at both the nucleotide and exon level, especially thelatter, where the average improvement on the newly assembled dataset is7.9% compared to the best result obtained by Genscan and HMMgene. Whentested on a long genomic multi-gene sequence, our method that maintainsreading frame consistency improved nucleotide level specificity by 21.0%and exon level specificity by 32.5% compared to the best result obtainedby either of the two programs individually.Availability: The scripts implementing our methods are availablefromhttp://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/genefinding/Contact:rogic@cse.ucsc.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000177504400002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/8/1034/232927/Improving-gene-recognition-accuracy-by-combining	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.8.1034	NULL	http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/genefinding/,http://rogic@cse.ucsc.edu	NULL	NULL
721	Why are complementary DNA strands symmetric?	http://baisnee@ics.uci.edu,http://hampson@ics.uci.edu,http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/RevCompSym/	ORIGINAL PAPER	27	49	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Pierre-François Baisnée,Steve Hampson,Pierre Baldi	NULL	Motivation: Over sufficiently long windows, complementary strands of DNA tend to have the same base composition. A few reports have indicated that this first-order parity rule extends at higher orders to oligonucleotide composition, at least in some organisms or taxa. However, the scientific literature falls short of providing a comprehensive study of reverse-complement symmetry at multiple orders and across the kingdom of life. It also lacks a characterization of this symmetry and a convincing explanation or clarification of its origin.Results: We develop methods to measure and characterize symmetry at multiple orders, and analyze a wide set of genomes, encompassing single- and double-stranded RNA and DNA viruses, bacteria, archae, mitochondria, and eukaryota. We quantify symmetry at orders 1 to 9 for contiguous sequences and pools of coding and non-coding upstream regions, compare the observed symmetry levels to those predicted by simple statistical models, and factor out the effect of lower-order distributions. We establish the universality and variability range of first-order strand symmetry, as well as of its higher-order extensions, and demonstrate the existence of genuine high-order symmetric constraints. We show that ubiquitous reverse-complement symmetry does not result from a single cause, such as point mutation or recombination, but rather emerges from the combined effects of a wide spectrum of mechanisms operating at multiple orders and length scales.Contact:baisnee@ics.uci.eduhampson@ics.uci.edupfbaldi@ics.uci.eduData:http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/RevCompSym/*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000177504400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/8/1021/232881/Why-are-complementary-DNA-strands-symmetric	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.8.1021	NULL	http://baisnee@ics.uci.edu,http://hampson@ics.uci.edu,http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/RevCompSym/	NULL	NULL

The performance ofprofile HMMs derived from the structural and sequence-based alignments hasbeen assessed for homologue detection.Results: The best alignment methods studied here correctly alignnearly 80% of residues with respect to structure alignments. Alignment quality and model sensitivity are found to be dependent on average number,length, and identity of sequences in the alignment. The striking conclusionis that, although structural data may improve the quality of multiplesequence alignments, this does not add to the ability of the derived profileHMMs to find sequence homologues.Supplementary information: A list of HOMSTRAD families used in this study and the corresponding Pfam families is available athttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/sgj/alignments/map.htmlContact:sgj@sanger.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1243/210834/The-use-of-structure-information-to-increase	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1243	NULL	http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/sgj/alignments/map.html,http://sgj@sanger.ac.uk	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL
734	"The correlation error and finite-size correction in an ungapped 
sequence alignment"	http://spouge@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	9	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yonil Park,John L. Spouge	NULL	Motivation: The BLAST program for comparing two sequencesassumes independent sequences in its random model. The resulting randomalignment matrices have correlations across their diagonals. Analyticformulas for the BLASTp-value essentially neglect these correlations and are equivalent to a random model with independent diagonals. Progress on theindependent diagonals model has been surprisingly rapid, but the practicalmagnitude of the correlations it neglects remains unknown. In addition, BLAST uses a finite-size correction that is particularly important wheneither of the sequences being compared is short. Several formulas for thefinite-size correction have now been given, but the corresponding errors inthe BLASTp-values have not been quantified. As the lengths of compared sequences tend to infinity, it is also theoretically unknown whether theneglected correlations vanish faster than the finite-size correction.Results: Because we required certain analytic formulas,our study restricted its computer experiments to ungapped sequencealignment. We expect some of our conclusions to extend qualitatively togapped sequence alignment, however. With this caveat, the finite-sizecorrection appeared to vanish faster than the neglected correlations.Although the finite-size correction underestimated the BLASTp-value, it improved the approximation substantially for all but very short sequences.In practice, the Altschul–Gish finite-size correction was superior to Spouge's. The independent diagonals model was always within a factor of 2 of the true BLASTp-value, although fittingp-value parameters from it probably is unwise.Contact:spouge@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1236/210819/The-correlation-error-and-finite-size-correction	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1236	NULL	http://spouge@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov	NULL	NULL

Stengel,Raffaele M. Ghigliazza,Nilesh V. Kulkarni	NULL	Motivation: Therapeutic enhancement of innate immune response tomicrobial attack is addressed as the optimal control of a dynamic system.Interactions between an invading pathogen and the innate immune system arecharacterized by four non-linear, ordinary differential equations thatdescribe rates of change of pathogen, plasma cell, and antibodyconcentrations, and of an indicator of organic health. Without therapy, thedynamic model evidences sub-clinical or clinical decay, chronicstabilization, or unrestrained lethal growth of the pathogen; the responsepattern depends on the initial concentration of pathogens in the simulatedattack. In the model, immune response can be augmented by therapeutic agentsthat kill the pathogen directly, that stimulate the production of plasmacells or antibodies, or that enhance organ health. A previous paperdemonstrated open-loop optimal control solutions that defeat the pathogenand preserve organ health, given initial conditions that otherwise would belethal (Stengelet al.(2002)). Therapies based on separate and combinedapplication of the agents were derived by minimizing a quadratic costfunction that weighted both system response and control usage, providingimplicit control over harmful side effects.Results: We demonstrate the ability of neighboring–optimal feedback control to account for a range of unknown initial conditions and persistentinput of pathogens by adjusting the therapy to account for perturbationsfrom the nominal-optimal response history. We examine therapies that combineopen-loop control of one agent with closed-loop control of another. We showthat optimal control theory points the way toward new protocols fortreatment and cure of human diseases.Contact:stengel@princeton.edurghiglia@princeton.edunkulkarn@princeton.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1227/210809/Optimal-enhancement-of-immune-response	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1227	NULL	http://stengel@princeton.edu,http://rghiglia@princeton.edu,http://nkulkarn@princeton.edu	NULL	NULL

squares with gene expression profiles"	http://dnguyen@stat.tamu.edu,http://dmrocke@ucdavis.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	63	145	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Danh V. Nguyen,David M. Rocke	NULL	Motivation: Discrimination between two classes such as normal and cancer samples and between two types of cancers based on gene expression profiles is an important problem which has practical implications as well as the potential to further our understanding of gene expression of various cancer cells. Classification or discrimination of more than two groups or classes (multi-class) is also needed. The need for multi-class discrimination methodologies is apparent in many microarray experiments where various cancer types are considered simultaneously.Results: Thus, in this paper we present the extension to theclassification methodologyproposed earlier Nguyen and Rocke (2002b;Bioinformatics,18, 39–50)to classify cancersamples from multiple classes.The methodologies proposed in this paperare applied to four gene expressiondata sets with multiple classes:(a) a hereditary breast cancer data set with(1)BRCA1-mutation,(2)BRCA2-mutation and(3) sporadic breast cancer samples,(b) an acute leukemia data set with(1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML),(2) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and(3) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples,(c) a lymphoma data set with(1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),(2) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and(3) follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, and(d) the NCI60 data set with cell lines derived fromcancers of varioussites of origin.In addition, we evaluated the classification algorithms and examined thevariability of the error rates using simulations based on randomizationof the real data sets.We note that there are other methods for addressing multi-class predictionrecently and our approach is along the line of Nguyen and Rocke (2002b;Bioinformatics,18, 39–50).Contact:dnguyen@stat.tamu.edudmrocke@ucdavis.edu	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1216/210800/Multi-class-cancer-classification-via-partial	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1216	NULL	http://dnguyen@stat.tamu.edu,http://dmrocke@ucdavis.edu	NULL	NULL

microarray data analysis"	http://e-dougherty@tamu.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	29	132	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Yidong Chen,Vishnu Kamat,Edward R. Dougherty,Michael L. Bittner,Paul S. Meltzer,Jeffery M. Trent	NULL	Motivation: Expression-based analysis for large families of geneshas recently become possible owing to the development of cDNA microarrays,which allow simultaneous measurement of transcript levels for thousands ofgenes. For each spot on a microarray, signals in two channels must beextracted from their backgrounds. This requires algorithms to extractsignals arising from tagged mRNA hybridized to arrayed cDNA locations andalgorithms to determine the significance of signal ratios.Results: This paper focuses on estimation of signal ratios from thetwo channels, and the significance of those ratios. The key issue is thedetermination of whether a ratio is significantly high or low in order toconclude whether the gene is upregulated or downregulated. The paperbuilds on an earlier study that involved a hypothesis test based on a ratiostatistic under the supposition that the measured fluorescent intensitiessubsequent to image processing can be assumed to reflect the signalintensities. Here, a refined hypothesis test is considered in which themeasured intensities forming the ratio are assumed to be combinations ofsignal and background. The new method involves a signal-to-noise ratio, andfor a high signal-to-noise ratio the new test reduces (with closeapproximation) to the original test. The effect of low signal-to-noise ratioon the ratio statistics constitutes the main theme of the paper. Finally,and in this vein, a quality metric is formulated for spots. This measure canbe used to decide whether or not a spot ratio should be deleted, or toadjust various measurements to reflect confidence in the quality of themeasurement.Contact:e-dougherty@tamu.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1207/210789/Ratio-statistics-of-gene-expression-levels-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1207	NULL	http://e-dougherty@tamu.edu	NULL	NULL

In this article we focuson the development of a clustering procedure based on the concept ofBayesian model-averaging and a precise statistical model of expression data.Results: We developed a clustering procedure based on theBayesian infinite mixture model and applied it to clustering gene expressionprofiles. Clusters of genes with similar expression patterns are identifiedfrom the posterior distribution of clusterings defined implicitly by thestochastic data-generation model. The posterior distribution of clusterings is estimated by a Gibbs sampler. We summarized the posterior distribution ofclusterings by calculating posterior pairwise probabilities of co-expressionand used the complete linkage principle to create clusters. This approachhas several advantages over usual clustering procedures. The analysis allows for incorporation of a reasonable probabilistic model for generating data.The method does not require specifying the number of clusters and resultingoptimal clustering is obtained by averaging over models with all possiblenumbers of clusters. Expression profiles that are not similar to any otherprofile are automatically detected, the method incorporates experimental replicates, and it can be extended to accommodate missing data. Thisapproach represents a qualitative shift in the model-based cluster analysisof expression data because it allows for incorporation of uncertaintiesinvolved in the model selection in the final assessment of confidence insimilarities of expression profiles. We also demonstrated the importance ofincorporating the information on experimental variability into theclustering model.Availability: The MS Windows™ based program implementing the Gibbs sampler and supplemental material is available athttp://homepages.uc.edu/~medvedm/BioinformaticsSupplement.htmContact:medvedm@email.uc.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1194/210782/Bayesian-infinite-mixture-model-based-clustering	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1194	NULL	http://homepages.uc.edu/~medvedm/BioinformaticsSupplement.htm,http://medvedm@email.uc.edu	NULL	NULL

Schmitt,George Stephanopoulos,Gregory Stephanopoulos	NULL	Motivation: Transcriptional profiling using microarrays can reveal important information about cellular and tissue expression phenotypes, but thesemeasurements are costly and time consuming. Additionally, tissue sampleavailability poses further constraints on the number of arrays that can beanalyzed in connection with a particular disease or state of interest. It istherefore important to provide a method for the determination of the minimumnumber of microarrays required to separate, with statistical reliability,distinct disease states or other physiological differences.Results: Power analysis was applied to estimate the minimum sample sizerequired for two-class and multi-class discrimination. The power analysisalgorithm calculates the appropriate sample size for discrimination ofphenotypic subtypes in a reduced dimensional space obtained by Fisherdiscriminant analysis (FDA). This approach was tested by applying the algorithm to existing data sets for estimation of the minimum sample sizerequired for drawing certain conclusions on multi-class distinction withstatistical reliability. It was confirmed that when the minimum number ofsamples estimated from power analysis is used, group means in the FDAdiscrimination space are statistically different.Contact:gregstep@mit.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1184/210767/Determination-of-minimum-sample-size-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1184	NULL	http://gregstep@mit.edu	NULL	NULL

Both visualization and analyses of such data require an explicit attention to the temporal structure.Results: Using three cell cycle trajectories fromSaccharomyces cerevisiaeto illustrate, we present several techniques which reveal the geometry of the data. We import phase-delay time plots from chaotic systems theory as a dynamic data visualization device and show how these plots capture important aspects of the trajectories.We construct an objective function to find an optimal two-dimensional projection of the cell cycle, demonstrate that the system returns to this plane after three different initial perturbations, and explore the conditions under which this geometric approach outperforms standard approaches such as singular value decomposition and Fourier analysis.Finally, we show how a geometric analysis can isolate distinct parts of the trajectories, in this case the initial perturbation versus the cell cycle.Contact:junhyong.kim@yale.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1176/210759/Geometry-of-gene-expression-dynamics	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1176	NULL	http://junhyong.kim@yale.edu	NULL	NULL

Eisen	NULL	Motivation: Many methods have been described to identify regulatory motifs in the transcription control regions of genes that exhibit similar patterns of gene expression across a variety of experimental conditions. Here we focus on a single experimental condition, and utilize gene expression data to identify sequence motifs associated with genes that are activated under this experimental condition. We use a linear model with two-way interactions to model gene expression as a function of sequence features (words) present in presumptive transcription control regions. The most relevant features are selected by a feature selection method called stepwise selection with monte carlo cross validation. We apply this method to a publicly available dataset of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, focussing on the 800 basepairs immediately upstream of each gene's translation start site (the upstream control region (UCR)).Results: We successfully identify regulatory motifs that are known to be active under the experimental conditions analyzed, and find additional significant sequences that may represent novel regulatory motifs. We also discuss a complementary method that utilizes gene expression data from a single microarray experiment and allows averaging over variety of experimental conditions as an alternative to motif finding methods that act on clusters of co-expressed genes.Availability: The software is available upon request from the first author or may be downloaded fromhttp://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sunduz.Contact:keles@stat.berkeley.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1167/210750/Identification-of-regulatory-elements-using-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1167	NULL	http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sunduz,http://keles@stat.berkeley.edu	NULL	NULL

We have devised a novel method designatedoligostickiness, a measure roughly proportional to the binding affinity of an oligonucleotide to a DNA of interest, in order to analyze genome sequences as a whole.Results: Fifteen representative genomes such asBacillus subtilis,Escherichia coli,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Caenorhabditis elegans,H. sapiensand others were analyzed by this method using more than 50 probe dodecanucleotides, offering the following findings: (i) Genome sequences can be specifically featured by way ofoligostickinessmaps. (ii)Oligostickinessanalysis, which is similar to but more informative than (G + C) content or repetitive sequence analysis, can reveal intra-genomic structures such as mosaic structures (E. coliandB. subtilis) and highly sticky/non-sticky regions of biological meanings. (iii) Some probe oligonucleotides such as dC12and dT12can be used for classifying genomes, clearly discriminating prokaryotes and eukaryotes. (iv) Based on globaloligostickiness, which is the average value of the local oligostickinesses, the features of a genome could be visualized in spider web mode. The pattern of a spider web as well as a set ofoligostickinessmaps is highly characteristic to each genome or chromosome. Thus, we called it as chromosome texture, leading to a finding that all the chromosomes contained in a cell, so far investigated, have a common texture.Availability:Oligostickinessesmaps used in this work are available athttp://gp.fms.saitama-u.ac.jp/Contact:koichi@fms.saitama-u.ac.jp*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178001400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1153/210710/Genome-structures-embossed-by-oligonucleotide	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1153	NULL	http://gp.fms.saitama-u.ac.jp/,http://koichi@fms.saitama-u.ac.jp	NULL	NULL

749	Subtle motifs: defining the limits of motif finding algorithms	http://keich@cs.ucsd.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	10	40	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	U. Keich,P.A. Pevzner	NULL	Motivation: What constitutes a subtle motif? Intuitively, it is a motif that is almost indistinguishable, in the statistical sense, from random motifs. This question has important practical consequences: consider, for example, a biologist that is generating a sample of upstream regulatory sequences with the goal of finding a regulatory pattern that is shared by these sequences. If the sequences are too short then one risks losing some of the regulatory patterns that are located further upstream. Conversely, if the sequences are too long, the motif becomes too subtle and one is then likely to encounter random motifs which are at least as significant statistically as the regulatory pattern itself. In practical terms one would like to recognize the sequence length threshold, or the twilight zone, beyond which the motifs are in some sense too subtle.Results: The paper defines the motif twilight zone where every motif finding algorithm would be exposed to random motifs which are as significant as the one which is sought. We also propose an objective tool for evaluating the performance of subtle motif finding algorithms. Finally we apply these tools to evaluate the success of our MULTIPROFILER algorithm to detect subtle motifs.Contact:keich@cs.ucsd.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1382/250692/Subtle-motifs-defining-the-limits-of-motif-finding	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1382	NULL	http://keich@cs.ucsd.edu	NULL	NULL

Identification of subtle regulatory motifs in a DNA sequence is a difficult pattern recognition problem. In this paper we design a new motif finding algorithm that can detect very subtle motifs.Results: We introduce the notion of a multiprofile and use it for finding subtle motifs in DNA sequences. Multiprofiles generalize the notion of a profile and allow one to detect subtle patterns that escape detection by the standard profiles. Our MULTIPROFILER algorithm outperforms other leading motif finding algorithms in a number of synthetic models.

contacts using a constrained Voronoi procedure"	http://brendan.mcconkey@weizmann.ac.il	ORIGINAL PAPER	37	59	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	B.J. McConkey,V. Sobolev,M. Edelman	NULL	Motivation: Geometric representations of proteins and ligands,including atom volumes, atom–atom contacts and solvent accessible surfaces,can be used to characterize interactions between and within proteins,ligands and solvent. Voronoi algorithms permit quantification of theseproperties by dividing structures into cells with a one-to-onecorrespondence with constituent atoms. As there is no generally acceptedmeasure of atom–atom contacts, a continuous analytical representation ofinter-atomic contacts will be useful. Improved geometric algorithms willalso be helpful in increasing the speed and accuracy of iterative modelingalgorithms.Results: We present computational methods based on the Voronoiprocedure that provide rapid and exact solutions to solvent accessiblesurfaces, volumes, and atom contacts within macromolecules. Furthermore, wedefine a measure of atom–atom contact that is consistent with thecalculation of solvent accessible surfaces, allowing the integration ofsolvent accessibility and inter-atomic contacts into a continuous measure.The speed and accuracy of the algorithm is compared to existing methods forcalculating solvent accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithmhas a reduced execution time and greater accuracy compared to numerical andapproximate analytical surface calculation algorithms, and a reducedexecution time and similar accuracy to existing Voronoi procedures forcalculating atomic surfaces and volumes.Availability: Source code and executable programs are availablefrom the authors.Contact:brendan.mcconkey@weizmann.ac.il*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1365/250632/Quantification-of-protein-surfaces-volumes-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1365	NULL	http://brendan.mcconkey@weizmann.ac.il	NULL	NULL

Schein,Werner Braun	NULL	Motivation: Many sequences, and in some cases structures, ofproteins that induce an allergic response in atopic individuals have beendetermined in recent years. This data indicates that allergens, regardlessof source, fall into discreet protein families. Similarities in the sequencemay explain clinically observed cross-reactivities between differentbiological triggers. However, previously available allergy databases groupallergens according to their biological sources, or observed clinicalcross-reactivities, without providing data about the proteins. A computer-aided data mining system is needed to compare the sequential andstructural details of known allergens. This information will aid inpredicting allergenic cross-responses and eventually in determining possiblecommon characteristics of IgE recognition.Results: The new web-based Structural Database of AllergenicProteins (SDAP) permits the user to quickly compare the sequence andstructure of allergenic proteins. Data from literature sources andpreviously existing lists of allergens are combined in a MySQL interactivedatabase with a wide selection of bioinformatics applications. SDAP can beused to rapidly determine the relationship between allergens and to screennovel proteins for the presence of IgE or T-cell epitopes they may sharewith known allergens. Further, our novel similarity search method, based onfive dimensional descriptors of amino acid properties, can be used to scanthe SDAP entries with a peptide sequence. For example, when a known IgEbinding epitope from shrimp tropomyosin was used as a query, the methodrapidly identified a similar sequence in known shellfish and insectallergens.This prediction of cross-reactivity between allergens is consistentwith clinical observations.Availability: SDAP is available on the web athttp://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/index.htmlContact:werner@newton.utmb.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1358/250590/Data-mining-of-sequences-and-3D-structures-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1358	NULL	http://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/index.html,http://werner@newton.utmb.edu	NULL	NULL

organisms  using DNA arrays"	http://kaderali@zpr.uni-koeln.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	15	74	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Lars Kaderali,Alexander Schliep	NULL	Motivation: DNA arrays are a very useful tool to quickly identify biological agents present in some given sample, e.g. to identify viruses causing disease, for quality control in the food industry, or to determine bacteria contaminating drinking water.The selection of specific oligos to attach to the array surface is a relevant problem in the experiment design process. Given a setSof genomic sequences (the target sequences), the task is to find at least one oligonucleotide, called probe, for each sequence inS. This probe will be attached to the array surface, and must be chosen in a way that it will not hybridize to any other sequence but the intended target. Furthermore, all probes on the array must hybridize to their intended targets under the same reaction conditions, most importantly at the temperatureTat which the experiment is conducted.Results: We present an efficient algorithm for the probe design problem. Melting temperatures are calculated for all possible probe–target interactions using an extended nearest-neighbor model, allowing for both non-Watson–Crick base-pairing and unpaired bases within a duplex. To compute temperatures efficiently, a combination of suffix trees and dynamic programming based alignment algorithms is introduced. Additional filtering steps during preprocessing increase the speed of the computation.The practicability of the algorithms is demonstrated by two case studies: The identification of HIV-1 subtypes, and of 28S rDNA sequences from ≥400 organisms.Availability: The software is available on request.Contact:kaderali@zpr.uni-koeln.de*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1340/250511/Selecting-signature-oligonucleotides-to-identify	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1340	NULL	http://kaderali@zpr.uni-koeln.de	NULL	NULL

757	Gene perturbation and intervention in probabilistic Boolean networks	http://is@ieee.org,http://is@ieee.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	39	156	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Ilya Shmulevich,Edward R. Dougherty,Wei Zhang	NULL	Motivation: A major objective of gene regulatory network modeling, in addition to gaining a deeper understanding of genetic regulation and control, is the development of computational tools for the identification and discovery of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as cancer. We consider the general question of the potential effect of individual genes on the global dynamical network behavior, both from the view of random gene perturbation as well as intervention in order to elicit desired network behavior.Results: Using a recently introduced class of models, called Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs), this paper develops a model for random gene perturbations and derives an explicit formula for the transition probabilities in the new PBN model. This result provides a building block for performing simulations and deriving other results concerning network dynamics. An example is provided to show how the gene perturbation model can be used to compute long-term influences of genes on other genes. Following this, the problem of intervention is addressed via the development of several computational tools based on first-passage times in Markov chains. The consequence is a methodology for finding the best gene with which to intervene in order to most likely achieve desirable network behavior. The ideas are illustrated with several examples in which the goal is to induce the network to transition into a desired state, or set of states. The corresponding issue of avoiding undesirable states is also addressed. Finally, the paper turns to the important problem of assessing the effect of gene perturbations on long-run network behavior. A bound on the steady-state probabilities is derived in terms of the perturbation probability. The result demonstrates that states of the network that are more ‘easily reachable’ from other states are more stable in the presence of gene perturbations. Consequently, these are hypothesized to correspond to cellular functional states.Availability: A library of functions written in MATLAB for simulating PBNs, constructing state-transition matrices, computing steady-state distributions, computing influences, modeling random gene perturbations, and finding optimal intervention targets, as described in this paper, is available on request fromis@ieee.org.Contact:is@ieee.org*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1319/250417/Gene-perturbation-and-intervention-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1319	NULL	http://is@ieee.org,http://is@ieee.org	NULL	NULL

The method simultaneously predictsthe gene structures of two un-annotated input DNA sequences whichare homologous to each other and retrieves the subsequences which areconserved between the two DNA sequences. It is capable of predictingpartial, complete and multiple genes and can align pairs of genes which differ byevents of exon-fusion or exon-splitting.The method employs a probabilistic pair hidden Markov model. We generate annotations using our model with two different algorithms: the Viterbi algorithm in its linear memory implementation and a new heuristic algorithm, called the stepping stone, for which both memory and time requirements scale linearly with the sequence length.We have implemented the model in a computer program called Doublescan.

A response to the computational intractability of most of the traditional criteria for inferring evolutionary trees has been a focus on new criteria,particularly quartet-based methods that seek to merge trees derived on subsets of four species from a given species-set into a tree for that entire set.Unfortunately, most of these methods are very sensitive to errors in thereconstruction of the trees for individual quartets of species. Arecently developed technique calledquartet cleaningcan alleviate this difficulty in certain cases by usingredundant information in the complete set of quartet topologies for a givenspecies-set to correct such errors.Results: In this paper, we describe two new localvertex quartet cleaning algorithms which have optimal time complexity and error-correction bound, respectively.

In this paper we present a general model for an information management system that is adaptable and scalable, followed by a detailed design and implementation of one component of the model. The prototype, called BioSifter, was applied to problems in the bioinformatics area.Results: BioSifter was tested using 500 documents obtained from PubMed database on two biological problems related to genetic polymorphism and extracorporal shockwave lithotripsy. The results indicate that BioSifter is a powerful tool for biological researchers to automatically retrieve relevant text documents from biological literature based on their interest profile. The results also indicate that the first stage of information management process, i.e. data to information transformation, significantly reduces the size of the information space. The filtered data obtained through BioSifter is relevant as well as much smaller in dimension compared to all the retrieved data. This would in turn significantly reduce the complexity associated with the next level transformation, i.e. information to knowledge.Contact:mpalakal@cs.iupui.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000178684000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/10/1283/250204/An-intelligent-biological-information-management	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1283	NULL	http://mpalakal@cs.iupui.edu	NULL	NULL

the example of codon usage in animals and plants"	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPER	0	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Laurent Duret	NULL	Large scale experiments of gene inactivation in yeast have shown that 50% of genes have no detectable impact on the phenotype, and similar observations have been made in other model organisms. This apparent paradox is probably due to the fact that many genes only have a marginal contribution to the fitness of organisms. Because of the size of populations and the number of generations that can be studied in laboratories, experimental approaches only permit to detect functional elements that have a strong phenotypic impact. Comparative sequence analysis can help to solve this problem: the analysis of sequences evolution permits to detect the action of selection, and hence to reveal functional features of genomes. This approach will be illustrated by the study of synonymous codon usage in animals and plants.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS91%2f190455	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S91/190455/Detecting-genomic-features-under-weak-selective	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S91	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

The identification of conserved elements is effected using theWaterman–Eggert local suboptimal alignment algorithm. We have modified animplementation of this algorithm such that it integrates the determination of statisticalsignificance for the local suboptimal alignments. This has the effect of outputting adynamically determined number of suboptimal alignments that are deemed statisticallysignificant. Comparison withexperimentally determined annotation shows a striking enrichement of regulatory sites among the conserved regions.

765	Using robotics to fold proteins and dock ligands	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPER	7	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Douglas Brutlag,Serkan Apaydin,Carlos Guestrin,David Hsu,Chris Varma,Amit Singh,Jean-Claude Latombe	NULL	The problems of protein folding and ligand docking have been explored largely using molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods. These methods are very compute intensive because they often explore a much wider range of energies, conformations and time than necessary. In addition, Monte Carlo methods often get trapped in local minima. We initially showed that robotic motion planning permitted one to determine the energy of binding and dissociation of ligands from protein binding sites (Singhet al., 1999). The robotic motion planning method maps complicated three-dimensional conformational states into a much simpler, but higher dimensional space in which conformational rearrangements can be represented as linear paths. The dimensionality of the conformation space is of the same order as the number of degrees of conformational freedom in three-dimensional space. We were able to determine the relative energy of association and dissociation of a ligand to a protein by calculating the energetics of interaction for a few thousand conformational states in the vicinity of the protein and choosing the best path from the roadmap.More recently, we have applied roadmap planning to the problem of protein folding (Apaydinet al., 2002a). We represented multiple conformations of a protein as nodes in a compact graph with the edges representing the probability of moving between neighboring states. Instead of using Monte Carlo simulation to simulate thousands of possible paths through various conformational states, we were able to use Markov methods to calculate the steady state occupancy of each conformation, needing to calculate the energy of each conformation only once. We referred to this Markov method of representing multiple conformations and transitions as stochastic roadmap simulation or SRS. We demonstrated that the distribution of conformational states calculated with exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations asymptotically approached the Markov steady state if the same Boltzman energy distribution was used in both methods. SRS permits one to calculate contributions from all possible paths simultaneously with far fewer energy calculations than Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods. The SRS method also permits one to represent multiple unfolded starting states and multiple, near-native, folded states and all possible paths between them simultaneously. The SRS method is also independent of the function used to calculate the energy of the various conformational states.In a paper to be presented at this conference (Apaydinet al., 2002b) we have also applied SRS to ligand docking in which we calculate the dynamics of ligand-protein association and dissociation in the region of various binding sites on a number of proteins. SRS permits us to determine the relative times of association to and dissociation from various catalytic and non-catalytic binding sites on protein surfaces. Instead of just following the best path in a roadmap, we can calculate the contribution of all the possible binding or dissociation paths and their relative probabilities and energies simultaneously.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS74%2f190392	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S74/190392/Using-robotics-to-fold-proteins-and-dock-ligands	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S74	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

These algorithms need information sources orfeaturesfrom which the models can be computed. For splice site prediction, the features we consider in this study are the presence or absence of certain nucleotides in close proximity to the splice site. Since it is not known how many and which nucleotides are relevant for splice site prediction, the set of features is chosen large enough such that the probability that all relevant information sources are in the set is very high. Using only those features that are relevant for constructing a splice site prediction system might improve the system and might also provide us with useful biological knowledge. Using fewer features will of course also improve the prediction speed of the system.Results: A wrapper-based feature subset selection algorithm using asupport vector machineor anaive Bayesprediction method was evaluated against the traditional method for selecting features relevant for splice site prediction. Our results show that this wrapper approach selects features that improve the performance against the use of all features and against the use of the features selected by the traditional method.Availability: The data and additional interactive graphs on the selected feature subsets are available athttp://www.psb.rug.ac.be/gpsContact:svgro@gengenp.rug.ac.beyvdp@gengenp.rug.ac.be	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS75%2f190405	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S75/190405/Feature-subset-selection-for-splice-site	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S75	NULL	http://www.psb.rug.ac.be/gps,http://svgro@gengenp.rug.ac.be,http://yvdp@gengenp.rug.ac.be	NULL	NULL

In this paper, we explain the approach of using the different available databases and software tools to start a large scale investigation of alternative splice forms. To collect information about alternative splicing we investigated known data in the databases using different computational methods. The investigations proceeded from the genomic sequence data to structural protein data. Then, we interpreted those data to find the relationship between alternative splice forms and protein functionand structure. We found some interesting features of alternative splicing which are presented here. We discuss the results of one chosen example.

The motivation of this work is to generate a system for automated annotation of data we are particularly interested in, namely proteins related to theMycoplasmataceaefamily. Following previous works on automatic annotation using symbolic machine learning techniques, the present work proposes a method of automatic annotation of keywords (a part of the SWISS–PROT annotation procedure), and the validation, by an expert, of the annotation rules generated. The aim of this procedure is twofold: to complete the annotation of keywords of those proteins which is far from adequate, and to produce a prototype of the validation environment, which is aimed at an expert who does not have adeep knowledge of the structure of the current databases containing the necessary information s/he needs.Results: As for the first objective, a rate of correct keywords annotation of 60% is reportedin the literature.

The physical interactions between protein domains are fundamental to the workings of a cell: in multi-domain polypeptide chains, in multi-subunit proteins and in transient complexes between proteins that also exist independently. Thus experimental investigation of protein-protein interactions has been extensive, including recent large-scale screens using mass spectrometry. The role of computational research on protein-protein interactions encompasses not only prediction, but also understanding the nature of the interactions and their three-dimensional structures. I will discuss properties such as sequence conservation and co-regulation of genes and proteins involved in different types of physical interactions. Given that all proteins consist of their evolutionary units, the domains, all interactions occur between these domains.

We consider modeling the occurrence frequencies of discrete patterns (such as starting points ofORFs or other interesting phenomena) along the genome. We use piecewise constant intensity modelswith varying number of pieces, and show how a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method can be used to obtain a posteriori distribution on the intensity of the patterns along the genome. We apply the method to modeling the occurrence of ORFs in the human genome. The results show that the chromosomesconsist of 5–35 clearly distinct segments, and that the posteriori number and length of thesegments shows significant variation.On the other hand, for the yeast genome the intensity of ORFs is nearly constant.Contact:Marko.Salmenkivi@cs.helsinki.fiJuha.Kere@biosci.ki.seHeikki.Mannila@cs.helsinki.fi	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS211%2f190750	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S211/190750/Genome-segmentation-using-piecewise-constant	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S211	NULL	http://Marko.Salmenkivi@cs.helsinki.fi,http://Juha.Kere@biosci.ki.se,http://Heikki.Mannila@cs.helsinki.fi	NULL	NULL

Rung,T. Schlitt,A. Brazma,K. Freivalds,J. Vilo	NULL	Motivation: Microarray experiments comparing expression levels of all genes in yeast for hundreds of mutants allow us to examine properties of gene regulatory networks on a genomic scale. We can investigate questions such as network modularity, connectivity, and look for genes with particular roles in the network structure.Results: We have built genome-wide disruption networks for yeast, using a representation of gene expression data as directed labelled graphs.Nodes represent genesand arcs connect nodes if the disruption of the source gene significantly alters the expression of the target gene.We are interested in features of the resulting disruption networks that are robust over a range of significance cutoffs. The networks show a significant overlap withanalogous networks constructed from scientific literature. In disruption networks the number of arcs adjacent to different nodes aredistributed roughly according to a power-law, like in many complexsystems where the robustness against perturbations is important. The networks are dominated by a single large component and do not have an obvious modular structure. Genes with the highest outdegrees often encode proteins withregulatory functions, whereas genes with the highestindegrees are predominantly involved in metabolism.The local structure of the networks is meaningful, genes involved in thesame cellular processes are close together in the network.Keywords: gene networks, microarrays, yeast, graph visualisationAvailability:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray/networksContact:schlitt@ebi.ac.ukjohan@ebi.ac.ukThese authors contributed equally to this paper.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS202%2f190727	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S202/190727/Building-and-analysing-genome-wide-gene-disruption	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S202	NULL	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray/networks,http://schlitt@ebi.ac.uk,http://johan@ebi.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Bourne,Ilya N. Shindyalov	NULL	Intensive growth in 3D structure data on DNA-protein complexes as reflectedin the Protein Data Bank (PDB) demands new approaches to the annotation andcharacterization of these data and will lead to a new understanding ofcritical biological processes involving these data. These data and thosefrom other protein structure classifications will become increasinglyimportant for the modeling of complete proteomes. We propose a fullyautomated classification of DNA-binding protein domains based on existing3D-structures from the PDB. The classification, by domain, relies on theProtein Domain Parser (PDP) and the Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm forstructural alignment. The approach involves the analysis of 3D-interactionpatterns in DNA-protein interfaces, assignment of structural domainsinteracting with DNA, clustering of domains based on structural similarityand DNA-interacting patterns. Comparison with existing resources ondescribing structural and functional classifications of DNA-binding proteinswas used to validate and improve the approach proposed here. In the courseof our study we defined a set of criteria and heuristics allowing us to automatically build a biologically meaningful classification and defineclasses of functionally related protein domains. It was shown that takinginto consideration interactions between protein domains and DNA considerablyimproves the classification accuracy.

Pipenbacher,A. Schliep,S. Schneckener,A. Schönhuth,D. Schomburg,R. Schrader	NULL	Motivation: The problem of finding remote homologues of a given protein sequence via alignment methods is not fully solved.In fact, the task seems to become more difficult with more data. As the size of the database increases, so does the noise level; the highest alignment scores due to random similarities increase and can be higher than the alignment score between true homologues.Comparing two sequences with an arbitrary alignment method yields a similarity value which may indicate an evolutionary relationship between them. A threshold value is usually chosen to distinguish between true homologue relationships and random similarities. To compensate for the higher probability of spurious hits in larger databases, this threshold is increased. Increasing specificity however leads to decreased sensitivity as a matter of principle.Sensitivity can be recovered by utilizing refined protocols. A number of approaches to this challenge have made use of the fact that proteins are often members of some larger protein family.This can be exploited by using position-specific substitution matrices or profiles, or by making use oftransitivityof homology. Transitivity refers to the concept of concluding homology between proteinsAandCbased on homology betweenAand a third proteinBand betweenBandC. It has been demonstrated that transitivity can lead to substantial improvement in recognition of remote homologues particularly in cases where the alignment score ofAandCis below the noise level.A natural limit to the use of transitivity is imposed by domains. Domains, compact independent sub-units of proteins, are often shared between otherwise distinct proteins, and can cause substantial problems by incorrectly linking otherwise unrelated proteins.Results: We extend a graph-based clustering algorithm which uses an asymmetric distance measure, scaling similarity values based on the length of the protein sequences compared. Additionally, the significance of alignment scores is taken into account and used for a filtering step in the algorithm.Post-processing, to merge further clusters based on profile HMMs is proposed.SCOP sequences and their super-family level classification are used as a test set for a clustering computed with our method for the joint data set containing both SCOP and SWISS-PROT. Note, the joint data set includes all multi-domain proteins, which contain the SCOP domains that are a potential source of incorrect links. Our method compares at high specificities very favorably with PSI-Blast, which is probably the most widely-used tool for finding remote homologues.We demonstrate that using transitivity with as many as twelve intermediate sequences is crucial to achieving this level of performance.Moreover, from analysis of false positives we conclude that our method seems to correctly bound the degree of transitivity used. This analysis also yieldsexplicitguidance in choosing parameters.The heuristics of the asymmetric distance measure used neither solve the multi-domain problem from a theoretical point of view, nor do they avoid all types of problems we have observed in real data. Nevertheless, they do provide a substantial improvement over existing approaches.Availability: The complete software source is freely available to all users under the GNU General Public License (GPL) fromhttp://www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.de/~proclust/download/Contact:proclust@www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.deschliep@zpr.uni-koeln.deSupplementary Information:http://www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.de/~proclust†Current address: Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, 14195, DE.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS182%2f190674	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S182/190674/ProClust-improved-clustering-of-protein-sequences	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S182	NULL	http://www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.de/~proclust/download/,http://proclust@www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.de,http://schliep@zpr.uni-koeln.de,http://www.bioinformatik.uni-koeln.de/~proclust	NULL	NULL

differential protein expression using chromatography-mass
spectrometry"	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPER	0	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Scott Patterson	NULL	The identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention can be accomplished on a systematic basis by a variety of techniques that include quantitative analysis of gene-specific mRNA levels and expressed proteins in normal and diseased cells. Differences in the expression levels of nucleic acid and protein gene products could suggest protein drug targets that are directly causative of disease, or reveal biochemical pathways that could be modulated by therapeutic molecules. Any effort based on mRNA or protein expression level comparisons could be confounded by a number of factors:level in steady-state may not be correlated with actual encoded protein levels;differentially expressed protein levels might be a result of disease process, and not causative of the process, and therapeutic intervention based on such a difference will be unproductive andthe differential expression of mRNA or protein may be the result of biological variation unrelated to the disease process under study.In order to address these possibly confounding factors, it is necessary to validate potential targets by establishing their firm association with disease, and their minimal distribution in non-diseased tissues of any type. This requirement suggests that emphasis on true and reproducible quantitation of protein expression levels in a variety of samples will be an effective and highly efficient method of generating drug targets with a high degree of utility. To achieve this aim, we have established an industrial-scale proteomics-based discovery platform consisting of cell biology, protein chemistry, and mass spectrometry technical groups together with bioinformatics groups. The analytical method used for quantitation employs isotope labeling for differential analysis (ICATTM, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). With this technique, tryptic peptides are generated from labeled proteins that have been specifically captured from various subcellular locations or protein families. The resulting peptides are identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. To evaluate this approach on a large-scale, we have applied it to a study of continuous cell lines derived from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. We have been able to establish processes for target discovery for small molecule drug targets as well as therapeutic antibody target identification for cell surface proteins. In addition, we have developed a process for identification of serum markers of this disease based upon standardized fractionation procedures. The results of these analyses will be presented together with the some of the issues from both the wet and dry (computational) lab that need to be addressed in such an undertaking.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS181%2f190673	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S181/190673/Selecting-targets-for-therapeutic-validation	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S181	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Guestrin,Chris Varma,Douglas L. Brutlag,Jean-Claude Latombe	NULL	Understanding the dynamics of ligand-protein interactions is indispensable in the design of novel therapeutic agents. In this paper, we establish the use of Stochastic Roadmap Simulation (SRS) for the study of ligand-protein interactions through two studies. In our first study, we measure the effects of mutations on the catalytic site of a protein, a process calledcomputational mutagenesis.In our second study, we focus on distinguishing the catalytic site from other putative binding sites.SRS compactly represents many Monte Carlo (MC) simulation paths in a compact graph structure, or roadmap. Furthermore, SRS allows us to analyze all the paths in this roadmap simultaneously. In our application of SRS to the domain of ligand-protein interactions, we consider a new parameter calledescape time, the expected number of MC simulation steps required for the ligand to escape from the ‘funnel of attraction‘ of the binding site, as a metric for analyzing such interactions. Although computing escape times would probably be infeasible with MC simulation, these computations can be performed very efficiently with SRS. Our results for six mutant complexes for the first study and seven ligand-protein complexes for the second study, are very promising: In particular, the first results agree well with the biological interpretation of the mutations, while the second results show that escape time is a good metric to distinguish the catalytic site for five out of seven complexes.Contact:apaydin@cs.stanford.eduguestrin@cs.stanford.edulatombe@cs.stanford.eduvarma@cs.stanford.edubrutlag@stanford.edu	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS18%2f190274	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S18/190274/Stochastic-roadmap-simulation-for-the-study-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S18	NULL	http://apaydin@cs.stanford.edu,http://guestrin@cs.stanford.edu,http://latombe@cs.stanford.edu,http://varma@cs.stanford.edu,http://brutlag@stanford.edu	NULL	NULL

Andersson,Cecilia Alsmark,Björn Canbäck,Wagied Davids,Carolin Frank,Olof Karlberg,Lisa Klasson,Boris Antoine-Legault,Alex Mira,Ivica Tamas	NULL	We are interested in quantifying the contribution of gene acquisition, loss, expansion and rearrangements to the evolution of microbial genomes. Here, we discuss factors influencing microbial genome divergence based on pair-wise genome comparisons of closely related strains and species with different lifestyles. A particular focus is on intracellular pathogens and symbionts of the generaRickettsia,BartonellaandBuchnera. Extensive gene loss and restricted access to phage and plasmid pools may provide an explanation for why single host pathogens are normally less successful than multihost pathogens. We note that species-specific genes tend to be shorter than orthologous genes, suggesting that a fraction of these may represent fossil-orfs, as also supported by multiple sequence alignments among species. The results of our genome comparisons are placed in the context of phylogenomic analyses of alpha and gamma proteobacteria. We highlight artefacts caused by different rates and patterns of mutations, suggesting that atypical phylogenetic placements can nota prioribe taken as evidence for horizontal gene transfer events. The flexibility in genome structure among free-living microbes contrasts with the extreme stability observed for the small genomes of aphid endosymbionts, in which no rearrangements or inflow of genetic material have occurred during the past 50 millions years (1). Taken together, the results suggest that genomic stability correlate with the content of repeated sequences and mobile genetic elements, and thereby indirectly with bacterial lifestyles.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS17%2f190258	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S17/190258/Comparative-genomics-of-microbial-pathogens-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S17	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Stadler	NULL	Motivation: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist, and theoptimalalignment is highly arbitrary.Results: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilitiesPijof a match between positioniin the first and positionjin the second sequence.Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights.A comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment in order to gain reliability information not available from a single optimal alignment.Availability: The software described in this contribution is available for downloading athttp://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ulim/probA/Contact:ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS153%2f190629	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S153/190629/Stochastic-pairwise-alignments	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S153	NULL	http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ulim/probA/,http://ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

A microarray is a device which enables a parallel experiment of ten tohundreds of thousands of test genes in order to measure gene expression.Due to this huge size of experimental data, automated image analysisis gaining importance in microarray image processing systems. Currently, most of the automated microarray image processing systemsrequire manual block indexing and, in some cases, spot indexing. If the microarray image is large and contains a lot of noise, it is very troublesome work. In this paper, we show it is possible to locate the addresses ofblocks and spots by applying the Nearest Neighbors Graph Model. Also, we propose an analytic model for the feasibility of block addressing.

integrated (and trying to make sense of it)"	http://www.ensembl.org	ORIGINAL PAPER	2	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Tim Hubbard	NULL	The availability of the genome sequences of human and mouse, human sequence variation data and other large genetic data sets will lead to a revolution in understanding of the human machine and the treatment of its diseases. The success of the international genome sequencing consortiums shows what can be achieved by well coordinated large scale public domain projects and the benefits of data access to all. It is already clear that the availability of this sequence is having a huge impact on research worldwide.Complete genome sequences provide a framework to pull all biological data together such that each piece has the potential to say something about biology as a whole. Biology is too complex for any organisation to have a monopoly of ideas or data, so the collection, analysis and access to this data can be contributed to by research institutes around the world. However, although it is possible for all this data to be accessible to all through the internet, the more organisations provide data or analysis separately, the harder it becomes for anyone to collect and integrate the results. To address these problems of intergration of data, open standards for biological data exchange, such as the‘ Distributed Annotation System’ (DAS) are being developed and bioinformatics (Dowellet al., 2001) as a whole is now being strongly driven by the open source software (OSS) model for collaborative software development (Hubbard and Birney, 1999). The leading provider of human genome annotation, the Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org), is entirely an OSS project and has been widely adopted by academic and commerical organisations alike (Hubbardet al., 2002).Accurate automatic annotation of features such as genes in vertebrate genomes currently relies on supporting evidence in the form of homologies to mRNAs, ESTs or protein. However, it appears that sufficient high quality experimentally curated annotation now exists to be used as a substrate for machine learning algorithms to create effective models of biological signal sequences (Down and Hubbard, 2002). Is there hope forab initioprediction methods after all?	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS140%2f190555	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S140/190555/Biological-information-making-it-accessible-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S140	NULL	http://www.ensembl.org	NULL	NULL

fixed-parameter approach"	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jens Gramm,Rolf Niedermeier	NULL	With breakpoint distance, the genome rearrangement field delivered one of the currently most popular measures in phylogenetic studies for related species. Here, BreakpointMedian, which is NP-complete already for three given species (whose genomes are represented as signed orderings), is the core basic problem. For the important special caseof three species, approximation (ratio 7/6) and exact heuristic algorithms were developed. Here, we provide an exact, fixed-parameter algorithmwith provable performance bounds. For instance, a breakpoint median for three signed orderings overnelements that causes at mostdbreakpoints can be computed in timeO((2.15)d·n). We show the algorithm's practical usefulness through experimental studies. In particular, we demonstrate that a simple implementation of our algorithmcombined with a new tree construction heuristicallows for a newapproach to breakpoint phylogeny, yielding evolutionary trees that arecompetitive in comparison with known results developedin a recent series of papers that use clever algorithm engineering methods.	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS128%2f190554	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S128/190554/Breakpoint-medians-and-breakpoint-phylogenies-A	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S128	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

795	"Identifying transcription factor binding sites through
Markov chain optimization"	http://jiang@cs.ucr.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	11	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Kyle Ellrott,Chuhu Yang,Frances M. Sladek,Tao Jiang	NULL	Even though every cell in an organism contains the same genetic material, each cell does not express the same cohort of genes. Therefore, one of the major problems facing genomic researchtoday is to determine not only which genes are differentiallyexpressed and under what conditions, but also how the expressionof those genes is regulated. The first step in determining differential gene expression is the binding of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (i.e.transcription factors) to regulatory regions of the genes (i.e.promotersandenhancers). An important aspect to understanding how a given transcription factor functions is to know the entire gamutof binding sites and subsequently potential target genes thatthe factor may bind/regulate. In this study, we have developed acomputer algorithm to scan genomic databases for transcription factorbinding sites, based on a novel Markov chain optimization method,and used it to scan the human genome for sites that bind tohepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α(HNF4α). A list of 71 known HNF4αbinding sites from the literature were used to train our Markov chain model. By looking at the window of 600 nucleotides around the transcription start site of each confirmedgene on the human genome, we identified 849 sites with varying binding potential and experimentally tested 109 of those sites for binding to HNF4α. Our results show that the program was very successful in identifying 77 new HNF4αbinding sites with varying binding affinities (i.e.a 71% success rate). Therefore, this computational method for searching genomic databasesfor potential transcription factor binding sites is a powerful toolfor investigating mechanisms of differential gene regulation.Contact:jiang@cs.ucr.edu	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS100%2f190491	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S100/190491/Identifying-transcription-factor-binding-sites	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S100	NULL	http://jiang@cs.ucr.edu	NULL	NULL

disease-relevant human genes"	http://jan.freudenberg@uni-bonn.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	32	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	J. Freudenberg,P. Propping	NULL	Motivation: A method for prediction of disease relevant human genes from the phenotypic appearance of a query disease is presented. Diseases of known genetic origin are clustered according to their phenotypic similarity. Each cluster entry consists of a disease and its underlying disease gene. Potential disease genes from the human genome are scored by their functional similarity to known disease genes in these clusters, which arephenotypically similar to the query disease.Results:For assessment of the approach, a leave-one-out cross-validation of 878 diseases from the OMIM database, using 10672 candidate genes from the human genome, is performed. Depending on the applied parameters, in roughly one-third of cases the true solution is contained within the top scoring 3% of predictions and in two-third of cases the true solution is contained within the top scoring 15% of predictions.The prediction results can either be used to identify target genes, when searching for a mutation in monogenic diseases or for selection of loci in genotyping experiments in genetically complex diseases.Contact:jan.freudenberg@uni-bonn.de	2002-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f18%2fsuppl_2%2fS110%2f190511	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/suppl_2/S110/190511/A-similarity-based-method-for-genome-wide	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.S110	NULL	http://jan.freudenberg@uni-bonn.de	NULL	NULL

804	Euclidian space and grouping of biological objects	http://grishin@chop.swmed.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	1	15	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Vyacheslav N. Grishin,Nick V. Grishin	NULL	Motivation:Biological objects tend to cluster into discrete groups. Objects within a group typically possess similar properties. It is important to have fast and efficient tools for grouping objects that result in biologically meaningful clusters. Protein sequences reflect biological diversity and offer an extraordinary variety of objects for polishing clustering strategies. Grouping of sequences should reflect their evolutionary history and their functional properties. Visualization of relationships between sequences is of no less importance. Tree-building methods are typically used for such visualization. An alternative concept to visualization is a multidimensional sequence space. In this space, proteins are defined as points and distances between the points reflect the relationships between the proteins. Such a space can also be a basis for model-based clustering strategies that typically produce results correlating better with biological properties of proteins.Results:We developed an approach to classification of biological objects that combines evolutionary measures of their similarity with a model-based clustering procedure. We apply the methodology to amino acid sequences. On the first step, given a multiple sequence alignment, we estimate evolutionary distances between proteins measured in expected numbers of amino acid substitutions per site. These distances are additive and are suitable for evolutionary tree reconstruction. On the second step, we find the best fit approximation of the evolutionary distances by Euclidian distances and thus represent each protein by a point in a multidimensional space. The Euclidian space may be projected in two or three dimensions and the projections can be used to visualize relationships between proteins. On the third step, we find a non-parametric estimate of the probability density of the points and cluster the points that belong to the same local maximum of this density in a group. The number of groups is controlled by a σ-parameter that determines the shape of the density estimate and the number of maxima in it. The grouping procedure outperforms commonly used methods such as UPGMA and single linkage clustering.Availability:The code of EESG program for Mathematica4 (Wolfram Research) as well as the details of the analysis are freely available atftp://iole.swmed.edu/pub/EESG/.Contact:grishin@chop.swmed.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800017&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1523/178249/Euclidian-space-and-grouping-of-biological-objects	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1523	NULL	http://grishin@chop.swmed.edu	NULL	NULL

To validate this hypothesis, we built adictionary- and rule-based system to mine Medline for references to genes andproteins, and used a Bayesian metric for scoring the relevance of each referenceassignment.Results:We analyzed the entire set of Medline records from 1966 to late 2001, and scored eachgene and protein reference using a Bayesian estimated probability (EP) based onword frequency in a training set of 137837 known assignments from 30594 articles to 36197 gene and protein symbols.Two test sets of 148 and 150randomly chosen assignments, respectively, were hand-validated and categorizedas either good or bad.The distributions of EP values, when plotted on a log-scale histogram, are shown to markedly differ between good and bad assignments.Using EP values, recall was 100% at 61% precision (EP=2×10−5), 63% at 88%precision (EP=0.008), and 10% at 100% precision (EP=0.1).These results showthat Medline entries discussing the same gene or protein have similar wordusage, and that our method of assessing this similarity using EP values isvalid, and enables an EP cutoff value to be determined that accurately andreproducibly balances precision and recall, allowing automated analysis ofliterature mining results.Contact:jlevy@incellico.com;jleonard@incellico.com;jeffcolombe@hotmail.com.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1515/178227/Finding-relevant-references-to-genes-and-proteins	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1515	NULL	http://jlevy@incellico.com,http://jleonard@incellico.com,http://jeffcolombe@hotmail.com	NULL	NULL

We empirically determined the most effectivegap penalties for protein sequence similarity searches with substitutionmatrices over a range of target evolutionary distances from 20 to 200 PointAccepted Mutations (PAMs).Results:We embedded real and simulated homologs of proteinsequences into a database and searched the database to determine the gappenalties that produced the best statistical significance for the distanthomologs. The most effective penalty for the first residue in a gap(q+r)changes as a function of evolutionary distance, while the gap extensionpenalty for additional residues(r)does not. For these data, the optimal gap penalties for a given matrix scaled in 1/3 bit units(e.g. BLOSUM50, PAM200) areq=25−0.1• (target PAM distance),r=5. Our results provide an empirical basis for selection of gap penalties and demonstrate how optimalgap penalties behave as a function of the target evolutionary distance ofthe substitution matrix.

807	An evaluation ofβ-turn prediction methods	http://raghava@imtech.res.in,http://imtech.res.in/raghava/betatpred/eval/	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	38	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Harpreet Kaur,G.P.S. Raghava	NULL	Motivation:β-turn is an important element of protein structure. In the pastthree decades, numerousβ-turn prediction methods have been developed based onvarious strategies. For a detailed discussion about the importance ofβ-turnsand a systematic introduction of the existing prediction algorithms forβ-turnsand their types, please see a recent review (Chou,Analytical Biochemistry,286, 1–16, 2000). However atpresent, it is still difficult to say which method is better than the other. Thisis because of the fact that these methods were developed on different sets ofdata. Thus, it is important to evaluate the performance ofβ-turn predictionmethods.Results:We have evaluated the performance of six methods ofβ-turn prediction.All the methods have been tested on a set of 426 non-homologous protein chains.It has been observed that the performance of the neural network based method, BTPRED,is significantly better than the statistical methods. One of the reasons for itsbetter performance is that it utilizes the predicted secondary structureinformation. We have also trained, tested and evaluated the performance of allmethods except BTPRED and GORBTURN, on new data set using a 7-fold cross-validation technique.

808	A simulated annealing algorithm for finding consensus sequences	http://jonathan@maths.uq.edu.au	ORIGINAL PAPER	17	25	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jonathan M. Keith,Peter Adams,Darryn Bryant,Dirk P. Kroese,Keith R. Mitchelson,Duncan A.E. Cochran,Gita H. Lala	NULL	Motivation:A consensus sequence for a family of related sequences is, as the name suggests, a sequence that captures the features common to most members of the family. Consensus sequences are important in various DNA sequencingapplications and are a convenient way to characterize a family of molecules.Results: This paper describes a new algorithm for finding a consensus sequence, using the popular optimization method known as simulated annealing.Unlike the conventional approach of finding a consensus sequence by first forming a multiple sequence alignment, this algorithm searches for a sequence that minimises the sum of pairwise distances to each of the input sequences. The resulting consensus sequence can then be used to induce a multiple sequence alignment. The time required by the algorithm scales linearly with the number of inputsequences and quadratically with the length of the consensus sequence. We present results demonstrating the high quality of the consensus sequencesand alignments produced by the new algorithm.For comparison, we also present similar results obtainedusing ClustalW. The new algorithm outperforms ClustalW in many cases.Availability: The software is made available upon request.Contact:jonathan@maths.uq.edu.au.*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1494/178159/A-simulated-annealing-algorithm-for-finding	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1494	NULL	http://jonathan@maths.uq.edu.au	NULL	NULL

Galas,T. Gregory Dewey	NULL	Motivation: There has been considerable interest in developing computational techniques for inferring genetic regulatory networks from whole-genome expression profiles.When expression time series data sets are available, dynamic models can, in principle, be used to infer correlative relationships between gene expression levels, which may be causal.However, because of the range of detectable expression levels and the current quality of the data, the predictive nature of such inferred, quantitative models is questionable.Network models derived from simple rate laws offer an intermediate level analysis, going beyond simple statistical analysis, but falling short of a fully quantitative description.This work shows how such network models can be constructed and describes the global properties of the networks derived from such a model.These global properties are statistically robust and provide insights into the design of the underlying network.Results: Several whole-genome expression time series data sets from yeast microarray experiments were analyzed using a Markov-modeling method (Dewey and Galas,Func. Integr. Genomics,1, 269–278, 2001) to infer an approximation to the underlying genetic network.We found that the global statistical properties of all the resulting networks are similar. The overall structure of these biological networks is distinctly different from that of other recently studied networks such as the Internet or social networks.These biological networks show hierarchical, hub-like structures that have some properties similar to a class of graphs known as small world graphs.Small world networks exhibit local cliquishness while exhibiting strong global connectivity.In addition to the small world properties, the biological networks show a power law or scale free distribution of connectivities.An inverse power law,N(k)∼k-3/2, for the number of vertices (genes) withkconnections was observed for three different data sets from yeast.We propose network growth models based on gene duplication events.Simulations of these models yield networks with the same combination of global graphical properties that we inferred from the expression data.Contact:Ashish_Bhan@kgi.eduDavid_Galas@kgi.eduGreg_Dewey@kgi.eduSupplementary Information:http://www.kgi.edu/html/noncore/faculty/dewey/bioinf.pdf*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1486/178137/A-duplication-growth-model-of-gene-expression	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1486	NULL	http://Ashish_Bhan@kgi.edu,http://David_Galas@kgi.edu,http://Greg_Dewey@kgi.edu,http://www.kgi.edu/html/noncore/faculty/dewey/bioinf.pdf	NULL	NULL

Miyano	NULL	Motivation: Recently, the temporal response of genes to changes in their environment has been investigated using cDNA microarray technology by measuring the gene expression levels at a small number of time points. Conventional techniques for time series analysis are not suitable for such a short series of time-ordered data. The analysis of gene expression data has therefore usually been limited to a fold-change analysis, instead of a systematic statistical approach.Methods: We use the maximum likelihood method together with Akaike's Information Criterion to fit linear splines to a small set of time-ordered gene expression data in order to infer statistically meaningful information from the measurements. The significance of measured gene expression data is assessed using Student'st-test.Results: Previous gene expression measurements of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. PCC6803 were reanalyzed using linear splines. The temporal response was identified of many genes that had been missed by a fold-change analysis. Based on our statistical analysis, we found that about four gene expression measurements or more are needed at each time point.Availability: An extension module for Python to calculate linear spline functions is available athttp://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon.

Palatini,Ralf Krahe,Fred A. Wright	NULL	Motivation: Oligonucleotide expression arrays exhibitsystematic and reproducible variation produced by the multiple distinctprobes used to represent a gene. Recently, a gene expression index has beenproposed that explicitly models probe effects, and provides improved fits ofhybridization intensity for arrays containing perfect match (PM) andmismatch (MM) probe pairs.Results: Here we use a combinationof analytical arguments and empirical data to show directly that theestimates provided by model-based expression indexes are superior to thoseprovided by commercial software. The improvement is greatest for genes in which probe effects vary substantially, and modeling the PM and MMintensities separately is superior to using the PM–MM differences. Toempirically compare expression indexes, we designed a mixing experimentinvolving three groups of human fibroblast cells (serum starved, serumstimulated, and a 50:50 mixture of starved/stimulated), with six replicateHuGeneFL arrays in each group. Careful spiking of control genes providesevidence that 88–98% of the genes on the array are detectablytranscribed, and that the model-based estimates can accurately detect thepresence versus absence of a gene. The use of extensive replication from singleRNA sources enables exploration of the technical variability of the array.Availability: Scripts for computing the Li–Wong reduced and full models are available in C, Splus and Perl in the supplementaryinformation.Contact:fwright@bios.unc.eduSupplementary information:http://thinker.med.ohio-state.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed at Present address: Department of Biostatistics UNC-CH, 3107B McGavran-Greenberg Hall, CB #7420, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7420, USA	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1470/178094/Theoretical-and-experimental-comparisons-of-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1470	NULL	http://fwright@bios.unc.edu,http://thinker.med.ohio-state.edu	NULL	NULL

McShane,Michael D. Radmacher,Boris Freidlin,Ren Yu,Ming-Chung Li,Richard Simon	NULL	Motivation: Recent technological advances such as cDNA microarray technology have made it possible to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes in a biological specimen. A cDNA microarray experiment produces a gene expression ‘profile’. Often interest lies in discovering novel subgroupings, or ‘clusters’, of specimens based on their profiles, for example identification of new tumor taxonomies. Cluster analysis techniques such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps have frequently been used for investigating structure in microarray data. However, clustering algorithms always detect clusters, even on random data, and it is easy to misinterpret the results without some objective measure of the reproducibility of the clusters.Results: We present statistical methods for testing for overall clustering of gene expression profiles, and we define easily interpretable measures of cluster-specific reproducibility that facilitate understanding of the clustering structure. We apply these methods to elucidate structure in cDNA microarray gene expression profiles obtained on melanoma tumors and on prostate specimens.Availability: Software to implement these methods is contained inBRB ArrayToolsmicroarray analysis package available fromhttp://linus.nci.nih.gov./BRB-ArrayTools.htmlContact:lm5h@nih.gov*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.†Present address: Human Genome Sciences Inc., Rockville, MD 20850, USA	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1462/178070/Methods-for-assessing-reproducibility-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1462	NULL	http://linus.nci.nih.gov./BRB-ArrayTools.html,http://lm5h@nih.gov	NULL	NULL

Altman	NULL	Motivation: Gene expression experiments provide a fast and systematic way toidentify disease markers relevant to clinical care.In this study, we addressthe problem of robust identification of differentially expressed genes frommicroarray data.Differentially expressed genes, or discriminator genes, aregenes with significantly different expression in two user-defined groups ofmicroarray experiments.We compare three model-free approaches: (1)nonparametrict-test, (2) Wilcoxon (or Mann–Whitney) rank sum test, and (3) a heuristic method based on high Pearson correlation to a perfectlydifferentiating gene (‘ideal discriminator method’).We systematically assess the performance of each method based on simulated and biological data undervarying noise levels andp-value cutoffs.Results: All methods exhibit very low false positive rates and identify a largefraction of the differentially expressed genes in simulated data sets with noiselevel similar to that of actual data.Overall, the rank sum test appears mostconservative, which may be advantageous when the computationally identifiedgenes need to be tested biologically.However, if a more inclusive list ofmarkers is desired, a higherp-value cutoff or the nonparametrict-test may be appropriate.When applied to data from lung tumor and lymphoma data sets, themethods identify biologically relevant differentially expressed genes that allowclear separation of groups in question.Thus the methods described andevaluated here provide a convenient and robust way to identify differentiallyexpressed genes for further biological and clinical analysis.Availability: By request from the authors.Contact:russ.altman@stanford.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1454/178048/Nonparametric-methods-for-identifying	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1454	NULL	http://russ.altman@stanford.edu	NULL	NULL

One of the major drawbacks of most ofthe existing clustering methods is that the number of clusters has tobe specifieda priori. Furthermore, by using pure unsupervised algorithms prior biological knowledge is totally ignored Moreover, mostcurrent tools lack an effective framework for tight integration ofunsupervised and supervised learning for the analysis of high-dimensional expression data and only very few multi-class supervisedapproaches are designed with the provision for effectively utilizingmultiple functional class labeling.Results: The paper adapts a novel Self-Organizing map called supervisedNetwork Self-Organized Map (sNet-SOM) to the peculiarities of multi-labeled gene expression data. The sNet-SOM determines adaptively thenumber of clusters with a dynamic extension process. This process isdriven by an inhomogeneous measure that tries to balance unsupervised,supervised and model complexity criteria. Nodes within a rectangulargrid are grown at the boundary nodes, weights rippled from the internalnodes towards the outer nodes of the grid, and whole columnsinserted within the map The appropriate level of expansion is determinedautomatically. Multiple sNet-SOM models are constructed dynamically eachfor a different unsupervised/supervised balance and model selectioncriteria are used to select the one optimum one. The results indicatethat sNet-SOM yields competitive performance to other recently proposedapproaches for supervised classification at a significantly reducedcomputational cost and it provides extensive exploratory analysispotentiality within the analysis framework. Furthermore, it exploressimple design decisions that are easier to comprehend andcomputationally efficient.Availability: The source code of the algorithms presented in the papercan be downloaded fromhttp://heart.med.upatras.gr.

Simon	NULL	Motivation: Two-color microarray experiments in which an aliquot derived from a common RNA sample is placed on each array are called reference designs. Traditionally, microarray experiments have used reference designs, but designs without a reference have recently been proposed as alternatives.Results: We develop a statistical model that distinguishes the different levels of variation typically present in cancer data, including biological variation among RNA samples, experimental error and variation attributable to phenotype. Within the context of this model, we examine the reference design and two designs which do not use a reference, the balanced block design and the loop design, focusing particularly on efficiency of estimates and the performance of cluster analysis. We calculate the relative efficiency of designs when there are a fixed number of arrays available, and when there are a fixed number of samples available.Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare the designs when the objective is class discovery based on cluster analysis of the samples. The number of discrepancies between the estimated clusters and the true clusters were significantly smaller for the reference design than for the loop design.The efficiency of the reference design relative to the loop and block designs depends on the relation between inter- and intra-sample variance.These results suggest that if cluster analysis is a major goal of the experiment, then a reference design is preferable. If identification of differentially expressed genes is the main concern, then design selection may involve a consideration of several factors.Contact:dobbinke@mail.nih.govSupplementary Information: Supplementary material referenced in the text can be found athttp://linus.nci.nih.gov/~brb/TechReport.htm*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2002-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000179249800006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/11/1438/178010/Comparison-of-microarray-designs-for-class	10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1438	NULL	http://dobbinke@mail.nih.gov,http://linus.nci.nih.gov/~brb/TechReport.htm	NULL	NULL

Due to the problem ofpotential cross hybridization, using full-length genes for microarrayconstruction is not appropriate in some situations. A bioinformatictool, PRIMEGENS, has recently been developed for the automatic designof PCR primers using DNA fragments that are specific to individual openreading frames (ORFs).Results: PRIMEGENS first carries out a BLAST search for each target ORFagainst all other ORFs of the genome to quickly identify possiblehomologous sequences. Then it performs optimal sequence alignmentbetween the target ORF and each of its homologous ORFs using dynamicprogramming. PRIMEGENS uses the sequence alignments to select gene- specific fragments, and then feeds the fragments to the Primer3 programto design primer pairs for PCR amplification. PRIMEGENS can be run fromthe command line on Unix/Linux platforms as a stand-alone package or itcan be used from a Web interface. The program runs efficiently, and ittakes a few seconds per sequence on a typical workstation. PCR primersspecific to individual ORFs fromShewanella oneidensisMR-1 andDeinococcus radioduransR1 have been designed.

Eichler,Sui Huang,Donald E. Ingber	NULL	Summary:Genome-wide expression profiles contain global patterns that evade visual detection in current gene clustering analysis. Here, a Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI) is described that uses self-organizing maps to translate high-dimensional expression profiles of time courses or sample classes into animated, coherent and robust mosaics images. GEDI facilitates identification of interesting patterns of molecular activity simultaneously across gene, time and sample space without prior assumption of any structure in the data, and then permits the user to retrieve genes of interest. Important changes in genome-wide activities may be quickly identified based on ‘Gestalt’ recognition and hence, GEDI may be especially useful for non-specialist end users, such as physicians.Availability:GEDI v1.0 is written in Matlab, and binary Matlab .dll files which require Matlab to run can be downloaded for free by academic institutions athttp://www.chip.org/~ge/gedihome.htmlSupplementary information:http://www.chip.org/~ge/gedihome.html	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200022&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2321/205984/Gene-Expression-Dynamics-Inspector-GEDI-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg307	NULL	http://www.chip.org/~ge/gedihome.html,http://www.chip.org/~ge/gedihome.html	NULL	NULL

Dougherty	NULL	Motivation:Data from microarray experiments are usually in the form of large matrices of expression levels of genes under different experimental conditions. Owing to various reasons, there are frequently missing values. Estimating these missing values is important because they affect downstream analysis, such as clustering, classification and network design. Several methods of missing-value estimation are in use. The problem has two parts: (1) selection of genes for estimation and (2) design of an estimation rule.Results:We propose Bayesian variable selection to obtain genes to be used for estimation, and employ both linear and nonlinear regression for the estimation rule itself. Fast implementation issues for these methods are discussed, including the use of QR decomposition for parameter estimation. The proposed methods are tested on data sets arising from hereditary breast cancer and small round blue-cell tumors. The results compare very favorably with currently used methods based on the normalized root-mean-square error.Availability:The appendix is available fromhttp://gspsnap.tamu.edu/gspweb/zxb/missing_zxb/(user: gspweb; passwd: gsplab).	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2302/206415/Missing-value-estimation-using-linear-and-non	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg323	NULL	http://edward@ee.tamu.edu,http://gspsnap.tamu.edu/gspweb/zxb/missing_zxb/	NULL	NULL

At present, discriminative methods such as SVM-Fisher and SVM-pairwise, which combine support vector machine (SVM) and sequence similarity, are recognized as the most accurate methods, with SVM-pairwise being the most accurate. However, these methods typically encode sequence information into their feature vectors and ignore the structure information. They are also computationally inefficient. Based on these observations, we present an alternative method for SVM-based protein classification. Our proposed method, SVM-I-sites, utilizes structure similarity for remote homology detection.Result:We run experiments on the Structural Classification of Proteins 1.53 data set. The results show that SVM-I-sites is more efficient than SVM-pairwise. Further, we find that SVM-I-sites outperforms sequence-based methods such as PSI-BLAST, SAM, and SVM-Fisher while achieving a comparable performance with SVM-pairwise.Availability:I-sites server is accessible through the web athttp://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu.

851	Sensitivity and specificity of inferring genetic regulatory interactions from microarray experiments with dynamic Bayesian networks	http://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/Supplements	ORIGINAL PAPERS	163	286	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Dirk Husmeier	NULL	Motivation:Bayesian networks have been applied to infer genetic regulatory interactions from microarray gene expression data. This inference problem is particularly hard in that interactions between hundreds of genes have to be learned from very small data sets, typically containing only a few dozen time points during a cell cycle. Most previous studies have assessed the inference results on real gene expression data by comparing predicted genetic regulatory interactions with those known from the biological literature. This approach is controversial due to the absence of known gold standards, which renders the estimation of the sensitivity and specificity, that is, the true and (complementary) false detection rate, unreliable and difficult. The objective of the present study is to test the viability of the Bayesian network paradigm in a realistic simulation study. First, gene expression data are simulated from a realistic biological network involving DNAs, mRNAs, inactive protein monomers and active protein dimers. Then, interaction networks are inferred from these data in a reverse engineering approach, using Bayesian networks and Bayesian learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo.Results:The simulation results are presented as receiver operator characteristics curves. This allows estimating the proportion of spurious gene interactions incurred for a specified target proportion of recovered true interactions. The findings demonstrate how the network inference performance varies with the training set size, the degree of inadequacy of prior assumptions, the experimental sampling strategy and the inclusion of further, sequence-based information.Availability:The programs and data used in the present study are available fromhttp://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/Supplements	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2271/206146/Sensitivity-and-specificity-of-inferring-genetic	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg313	NULL	http://dirk@bioss.ac.uk,http://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/Supplements	NULL	NULL

Doytchinova,D.R. Flower	NULL	Motivation:The immunogenicity of peptides depends on their ability to bind to MHC molecules. MHC binding affinity prediction methods can save significant amounts of experimental work. The class II MHC binding site is open at both ends, making epitope prediction difficult because of the multiple binding ability of long peptides.Results:An iterative self-consistent partial least squares (PLS)-based additive method was applied to a set of 66 peptides no longer than 16 amino acids, binding to DRB1*0401. A regression equation containing the quantitative contributions of the amino acids at each of the nine positions was generated. Its predictability was tested using two external test sets which gaverpred= 0.593 andrpred= 0.655, respectively. Furthermore, it was benchmarked using 25 known T-cell epitopes restricted by DRB1*0401 and we compared our results with four other online predictive methods. The additive method showed the best result finding 24 of the 25 T-cell epitopes.Availability:Peptides used in the study are available fromhttp://www.jenner.ac.uk/JenPep.

Giles,David Kipling	NULL	Motivation:Experimental limitations have resulted in the popularity of parametric statistical tests as a method for identifying differentially regulated genes in microarray data sets. However, these tests assume that the data follow a normal distribution. To date, the assumption that replicate expression values for any gene are normally distributed, has not been critically addressed for Affymetrix GeneChip data.Results:The normality of the expression values calculated using four different commercial and academic software packages was investigated using a data set consisting of the same target RNA applied to 59 human Affymetrix U95A GeneChips using a combination of statistical tests and visualization techniques. For the majority of probe sets obtained from each analysis suite, the expression data showed a good correlation with normality. The exception was a large number of low-expressed genes in the data set produced using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, which showed a striking non-normal distribution. In summary, our data provide strong support for the application of parametric tests to GeneChip data sets without the need for data transformation.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2254/206088/Normality-of-oligonucleotide-microarray-data-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg311	NULL	http://KiplingD@cardiff.ac.uk	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=qqqqqqqq	NULL

Alignment of tree is one of the proposed measures. Similar to pair-wise sequence comparison, there is often disagreement about how to weight matches, mismatches, indels and gaps when we compare two trees. For sequence comparison, the parametric sequence alignment tools have been developed. The users are allowed to see explicitly and completely the effect of parameter choices on the optimal sequence alignments. A similar tool for aligning two ordered trees is required in practice.Results:We develop a parametric tool for aligning two ordered trees that allow users to see the effect of parameter choices on the optimal alignment of trees.

In this study, we make use of a consensus-building algorithm and comparative genomics to conduct an in-depth analysis of the LexA-regulon of gamma proteobacteria, and we use the inferred results to study the evolution of this regulatory network and to examine the usefulness of the control sequences and gene contents of regulons in phylogenetic analysis.Results:We show, for the first time, the substantial heterogeneity that the LexA-regulon of gamma proteobacteria displays in terms of gene content and we analyze possible branching points in its evolution.

857	Linking the growth inhibition response from the National Cancer Institute's anticancer screen to gene expression levels and other molecular target data	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	14	20	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Anders Wallqvist,Alfred A. Rabow,Robert H. Shoemaker,Edward A. Sausville,David G. Covell	NULL	Motivation:Data mining tools are proposed to establish mechanistic connections between chemotypes and specific cellular functions. Drawing on a previous study that classified the cellular response patterns of growth inhibition measurements log( GI50) from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) anticancer screen, we have examined additional data for mRNA expression, sets of known molecular targets and mutational status against these same tumor cell lines to relate chemosensitivity more precisely to biochemical pathways.Results:Our analysis finds that gene expression levels do not, in general, correlate with log(GI50) measurements, instead they reflect a generic toxic condition. Within the remaining set of non-generic conditions, examples were found where a correlation suggesting a biochemical basis for cellular cytotoxicity could be supported. These included reconfirmation of previously observed associations between mutant and wild-type status of p53, and chemosensitivity to alkylating agents, while extending these results to reveal associations with γ-induced expressions of MDM2, WAF1 and GADD45, signals that were not apparent in measurements of basal mRNA expression levels for any of these genes. Additional examinations revealed that mRNA expression levels directly correlated with paclitaxel chemosensitivity to mitosis, while also identifying additional chemotypes as P-glycoprotein substrates. Our analysis revealed well-known direct associations between p16 mutant status and chemotypes implicated in cell cycle control, and extended these results to include expression levels for three additional tyrosine kinase proteins (TEK, transgelin andhCdc4). Links were also found that suggested associations between chemosensitivity and the endocrine, paracrine ligand–receptor loops, via expression of the adrenergic receptor, calcium second messenger pathways via expression levels of carbonic anhydrase and cellular communication pathways via fibrillin.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2212/205854/Linking-the-growth-inhibition-response-from-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg302	NULL	http://wallqvist@ncifcrf.gov	NULL	NULL

MGraph with its graphical interface allows the user to predict genetic regulatory networks by a graphical gaussian model (GGM), and to quantify the effects of different experimental treatment conditions on gene expression profiles by a graphical log-linear model (GLM). The power of graphical models was explored and illustrated through two example applications. First, four MAPK pathways in yeast were meaningfully reconstructed through GGM. Second, GLM was used to quantify the contributions of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance inDrosophila melanogaster. This application may provide a valuable aid in the prediction of genetic regulatory networks, as well as in investigations of various experimental conditions that affect global gene expression profiles.Availability:The MATLAB program MGraph is freely available athttp://www.uio.no/~junbaiw/mgraph/mgraph.htmlfor academics.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2210/205769/MGraph-graphical-models-for-microarray-data	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg298	NULL	http://junbai.wang@radium.uio.no,http://www.uio.no/~junbaiw/mgraph/mgraph.html	NULL	NULL
859	A comparative study of machine-learning methods to predict the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein function	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	75	100	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	V.G. Krishnan,D.R. Westhead	NULL	Motivation:The large volume of single nucleotide polymorphism data now available motivates the development of methods for distinguishing neutral changes from those which have real biological effects. Here, two different machine-learning methods, decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs), are applied for the first time to this problem. In common with most other methods, only non-synonymous changes in protein coding regions of the genome are considered.Results:In detailed cross-validation analysis, both learning methods are shown to compete well with existing methods, and to out-perform them in some key tests. SVMs show better generalization performance, but decision trees have the advantage of generating interpretable rules with robust estimates of prediction confidence. It is shown that the inclusion of protein structure information produces more accurate methods, in agreement with other recent studies, and the effect of using predicted rather than actual structure is evaluated.Availability:Software is available on request from the authors.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2199/205730/A-comparative-study-of-machine-learning-methods-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg297	NULL	http://westhead@bmb.leeds.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Such unique gene sequence tags (GSTs) replace advantageously cDNAs in microarray transcript profiling experiments. In particular, probes corresponding to individual members of multigene families can be chosen carefully to avoid cross-hybridization events.Results:The Specific Primer and Amplicon Design Software (SPADS) was constructed to delineate the more divergent regions in each gene by comparing them with a completely annotated genome sequence and to select optimal primer pairs for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of one divergent region per gene. SPADS is a unique integrated tool to design specific GSTs from any public or private genome sequences and allows the user to fine-tune GST size and specificity.

A multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins demonstrates that some of the missense variants are located in highly conserved regions of the NTPase domain and possibly impair NTP-hydrolysis. Intriguingly, one of the variations, which is found identically in PYPAF1 and NOD2, is located at the same alignment position. Our findings suggest that evolutionary gene duplication can give rise to disease families because variants affect conserved sequence in a similar fashion.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2171/206442/Disease-associated-variants-in-PYPAF1-and-NOD2	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg370	NULL	http://mario.albrecht@mpi-sb.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

Vinogradov	NULL	The sequence of silent DNA in the human genome (intergenic spacers, introns and synonymous codon positions of protein-coding genes) was found here to have the higher thermostability of corresponding RNA/RNA and RNA/DNA duplexes as compared with randomized sequence. This difference increased with elevation of GC content. The revealed effect was not due to correlation of RNA/RNA and RNA/DNA thermostabilities with thermostability of the DNA/DNA duplex, which, on the contrary, was lower than in the randomized sequence and lagged behind the elevation of GC content. The same picture was observed in the genomes of other warm-blooded vertebrates but not in the lower organisms. This finding suggests that RNA–RNA and RNA–DNA interactions could be involved in the putative function of silent DNA.	2003-11-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186919200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/17/2167/206352/Silent-DNA-speaking-RNA-language	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg320	NULL	http://aevin@mail.cytspb.rssi.ru	NULL	NULL

There is no unified namingconvention for biological object, and biological terms may beambiguous or polysemic. This makes the integration and interactionof databases difficult.

Westbrook,Philip E. Bourne	NULL	Motivation: Crystallographers were motivated 10 years ago todevelop a simple and consistent data representation for the exchangeand archiving of data associated with the crystallographicexperiment and the final structure. As this process evolved (and thedata grew at near exponential rates) came the recognition that thisrepresentation should also facilitate the automated management ofthe data and, with the aid of additional software for verificationand validation, provide improved consistency and accuracy and henceimproved scientific inquiry. This realization led to a newDictionary Definition Language (DDL) and an extensive dictionarybased on this DDL for describing macromolecular structure. In broadterms this could be considered an ontology. An important feature inthe development of the ontology was the endorsement and ongoingmaintenance and support of the International Union ofCrystallography (IUCr). While the description of macromolecularstructure and the x-ray crystallographic experiment used to deriveit represent explicit data, the ontology is extensible andapplicable to other less well- characterized data domains.Results: Details of the DDL, the dictionaries that have beendeveloped, and software for reading and using this ontology arepresented.Availability: Extensive documentation, software tools and the DDLand dictionaries are available fromhttp://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/mmcifandassociated mirror sites.Contact: Bourne:bourne@sdsc.eduandWestbrook:jwest@rcsb.rutgers.edu	2000-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087033600013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/2/159/232068/STAR-mmCIF-An-ontology-for-macromolecular	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.2.159	NULL	http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/mmcif,http://bourne@sdsc.edu,http://jwest@rcsb.rutgers.edu	NULL	NULL

These methods can subsequently beutilized to improve the performance of gene-finding systems. Themodels built here attempt to model long-distance dependenciesbetween non-adjacent bases.Results: An efficient modeling method is described which modelsbiological data more accurately than a first-order Markov modelwithout increasing the number of parameters. Intuitively, a smallnumber of parameters helps a learning system to avoid overfitting.Several experiments with the model are presented, which show a smallimprovement in the average accuracy as compared with a simple Markovmodel. These experiments suggest that single long distancedependencies do not help the recognition problem, thus confirmingseveral previous studies which have used more heuristic modelingtechniques.Availability: This software is available for download and as aweb resource athttp://www.ai.uic.edu/softwareContact:kasif@eecs.uic.edu	2000-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087033600012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/2/152/232055/Modeling-splice-sites-with-Bayes-networks	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.2.152	NULL	http://www.ai.uic.edu/software,http://kasif@eecs.uic.edu	NULL	NULL

  for quickly finding the most parsimonious evolutionary trees"	http://s.kumar@asu.edu	ARTICLE	14	19	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	P. W. Purdom, Jr,P. G. Bradford,K. Tamura,S. Kumar	NULL	Motivation: In the maximum parsimony (MP) method, the treerequiring the minimum number of changes (discrepancy) to explain thegiven set of DNA or amino acid sequences is chosen to representtheir evolutionary relationships. To find the MP tree, thebranch-and-bound algorithm is normally used. For a partialphylogenetic-tree (one that has a subset of the organisms) thetraditional algorithm assigns a cost equal to the discrepancy of thepartial phylogenetic-tree. We propose a single column discrepancyheuristic which increases this cost by predicting a minimumadditional discrepancy needed to attach the sequences yet to beadded to the partial phylogenetic-tree. A dynamic Max-mini order ofsequence addition is also proposed to quickly terminatebranch-and-bound search paths that are guaranteed to lead tosuboptimal solutions.Results: We studied the running time of 47 problems generatedfrom 17 data sets. The use of single column discrepancy heuristicspeeded up the computation to 2.4-fold for static and 18.2-fold fordynamic search order. The improvement appeared to increaseexponentially with the number of sequences. The proposed strategiesare also likely to be useful in speeding up the MP tree search usingheuristic searches that are based on branch-and-bound-likealgorithms.Contact:s.kumar@asu.edu	2000-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087033600011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/2/140/232038/Single-column-discrepancy-and-dynamic-max-mini	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.2.140	NULL	http://s.kumar@asu.edu	NULL	NULL

  using LaTeX2e"	http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/tse.html,http://eric.beitz@uni-tuebingen.de	ARTICLE	75	162	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Eric Beitz	NULL	Motivation: Typesetting, shading and labeling of nucleotide andpeptide alignments using standard word processing or graphicssoftware is time consuming. Available automatic sequence shadingprograms usually do not allow manual application of additionalshadings or labels. Hence, a flexible alignment shading package wasdesigned for both calculated and manual shading, using the macrolanguage of the scientific typesetting software LaTeX2e.Results: TeXshade is the first TeX-based alignment shadingsoftware featuring, in addition to standard identity and similarityshading, special modes for the display of functional aspects such ascharge, hydropathy or solvent accessibility. A plenitude of commandsfor manual shading, graphical labels, re-arrangements of thesequence order, numbering, legends etc. is implemented. Further,TeXshade allows the inclusion and display of secondary structurepredictions in the DSSP-, STRIDE- and PHD-format.Availability: Fromhttp://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/tse.html(macropackage and on-line documentation)Contact:eric.beitz@uni-tuebingen.de	2000-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087033600010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/2/135/232020/TeXshade-shading-and-labeling-of-multiple-sequence	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.2.135	NULL	http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/tse.html,http://eric.beitz@uni-tuebingen.de	NULL	NULL

Teichmann,Cyrus Chothia,George M. Church,Jong Park	NULL	Motivation: For large-scale structural assignment to sequences,as in computational structural genomics, a fast yet sensitivesequence search procedure is essential. A new approach usingintermediate sequences was tested as a shortcut to iterativemultiple sequence search methods such as PSI-BLAST.Results: A library containing potential intermediate sequencesfor proteins of known structure (PDB-ISL) was constructed. Thesequences in the library were collected from a large sequencedatabase using the sequences of the domains of proteins of knownstructure as the query sequences and the program PSI-BLAST.Sequences of proteins of unknown structure can be matched todistantly related proteins of known structure by using pairwisesequence comparison methods to find homologues in PDB-ISL. Searchesof PDB-ISL were calibrated, and the number of correct matches foundat a given error rate was the same as that found by PSI-BLAST. Theadvantage of this library is that it uses pairwise sequencecomparison methods, such as FASTA or BLAST2, and can, therefore, besearched easily and, in many cases, much more quickly than aniterative multiple sequence comparison method. The procedure isroughly 20 times faster than PSI-BLAST for small genomes and severalhundred times for large genomes.Availability: Sequences can be submitted to the PDB-ISL serversathttp://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/PDB˙ISL/orhttp://cyrah.ebi.ac.uk:1111/Serv/PDB˙ISL/andcan be downloaded fromftp://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/pub/PDB˙ISL/orftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/contrib/jong/PDB˙ISL/Contact:sat@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.ukandjong@ebi.ac.uk	2000-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087033600007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/2/117/231980/Fast-assignment-of-protein-structures-to-sequences	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.2.117	NULL	http://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/PDB\|[dot]\|ISL/,http://cyrah.ebi.ac.uk:1111/Serv/PDB\|[dot]\|ISL/,http://sat@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,http://jong@ebi.ac.uk	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

The average family size of the resulting alignments oftranslated EST sequences contained &10 sequences.

The structuralclassification of proteins can provide us with a clear criterion forjudgment in homology detection. There have been several assessmentsbased on structural sequences with classifications but a good dealof similar work is now being repeated with locally developedprocedures and programs. The SAT will provide developers with acomplete package which will save time and produce more comparableperformance assessments for search algorithms. The package iscomplete in the sense that it provides a non-redundant largesequence resource database, a well-characterized query database ofproteins domains, all the parsers and some previous results fromPSI-BLAST and a hidden markov model algorithm.Results: An analysis on two different data sets was carried outusing the SAT package. It compared the performance of a full proteinsequence database (RSDB100) with a non-redundant representativesequence database derived from it (RSDB50).

Karp	NULL	Motivations: A number of important bioinformatics computationsinvolvecomputing with function:executing computationaloperations whose inputs or outputs are descriptions of the functionsof biomolecules. Examples include performing functional queries tosequence and pathway databases, and determining functional equalityto evaluate algorithms that predict function from sequence. Aprerequisite to computing with function is the existence of anontology that provides a structured semantic encoding of function.Functional bioinformaticsis an emerging subfield ofbioinformatics that is concerned with developing ontologies andalgorithms for computing with biological function.Results: The article explores the notion of computing withfunction, and explains the importance of ontologies of function tobioinformatics. The functional ontology developed for the EcoCycdatabase is presented. This ontology can encode a diverse array ofbiochemical processes, including enzymatic reactions involvingsmall-molecule substrates and macromolecular substrates,signal-transduction processes, transport events, and mechanisms ofregulation of gene expression.

Uberbacher	NULL	*To whom correspondence should be addressed.Motivation: This paper investigates the sequence-structurespecificity of a representative knowledge based energy function byapplying it tothreadingat the level ofsecondarystructuresof proteins. Assessing the strengths and weaknessesof an energy function at this fundamental level provides moredetailed and insightful information than at the tertiary structurelevel and the results obtained can be useful in tertiary levelthreading.Results: We threaded each of the 293 non-redundant proteins ontothe secondary structures contained in its respective native protein(host template). We also used 68 pairs of proteins with similarfolds and low sequence identity. For each pair, we threaded thesequence of one protein onto the secondary structures of the otherprotein. The discerning power of the total energy function and itsone-body, pairwise, and mutation components is studied. We thenapplied our energy function to a recent study which demonstrated howa designed 11-amino acid sequence can replace distinct segments (onesegment is an α-helix, the other is a β-sheet) of a proteinwithout changing its fold. We conducted random mutations of thedesigned sequence to determine the patterns for favorable mutations.We also studied the sequence-structure specificity at the boundariesof a secondary structure. Finally, we demonstrated how to speed uptertiary level threading by filtering out alignments found to beenergetically unfavorable during the secondary structurethreading.Availability: The program is available on request from theauthors.Contact:xud@ornl.gov	2000-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087630000009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/3/257/246461/Sequence-structure-specificity-of-a-knowledge	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.3.257	NULL	http://xud@ornl.gov	NULL	NULL

Accurate prediction ofwhether a functionally or structurally important Cys occurs in theoxidized or thiol form would be helpful for molecular biologyexperiments and structure prediction.Results: A new method is presented for predicting the oxidationstate of Cys residues based on multiple sequence alignments and onthe observation that Cys tends to occur in the same oxidation statewithin the same protein. The prediction of the redox state of Cysperforms above 82%. The oxidation state of Cys correlates with thecellular location of the given protein within the cell, but thecorrelation is not perfect (up to 70%). We also perform astatistical analysis of the different redox states of Cys found insecondary structures and buried positions, and of the secondarystructures linked by disulfide bonds. The results suggest that thenatural borderline lies between the different oxidation states ofCys rather than between the half cystines and cysteins.Availability: A web server implementing the prediction method isavailable athttp://guitar.rockefeller.edu/~andras/cyspred.htmlContact:fisera@rockefeller.edu	2000-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087630000008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/3/251/246452/Predicting-the-oxidation-state-of-cysteines-by	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.3.251	NULL	http://guitar.rockefeller.edu/~andras/cyspred.html,http://fisera@rockefeller.edu	NULL	NULL

Biophysical properties are appropriate for low dimensionalencoding of protein sequence data. However, in general there is no apriori knowledge of the relevant properties for extraction ofrepresentative features.Results: An adaptive encoding artificial neural network (ACN) forrecognition of sequence patterns is described. In this approachparameters for sequence encoding are optimized within the sameprocess as the weight vectors by an evolutionary algorithm. Themethod is applied to the prediction of signal peptide cleavage sitesin human secretory proteins and compared with an establishedpredictor for signal peptides.Conclusion: Knowledge ofphysico-chemical properties is not necessary for training an ACN.The advantage is a low dimensional data representation leading tocomputational efficiency, easy evaluation of the detected features,and high prediction accuracy.Availability: A cleavage site prediction server is located at theHumboldt Universityhttp://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~jo/sig-cleave/ACNpredictor.cgiContact:jo@itb.hu-berlin.de;berndj@zedat.fu-berlin.de	2000-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087630000007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/3/245/246437/Adaptive-encoding-neural-networks-for-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.3.245	NULL	http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~jo/sig-cleave/ACNpredictor.cgi,http://jo@itb.hu-berlin.de,http://berndj@zedat.fu-berlin.de	NULL	NULL

Brutlag	NULL	*To whom correspondence should be addressed.3Present address: Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. E-mail: twu@gene.com.Motivation: We present techniques for increasing the speed ofsequence analysis using scoring matrices. Our techniques are basedon calculating, for a given scoring matrix, the quantile function,which assigns a probability, or p, value to each segmental score.Our techniques also permit the user to specify a p threshold toindicate the desired trade-off between sensitivity and speed for aparticular sequence analysis. The resulting increase in speed shouldallow scoring matrices to be used more widely in large-scalesequencing and annotation projects.Results: We develop three techniques for increasing the speed ofsequence analysis: probability filtering, lookahead scoring, andpermuted lookahead scoring. In probability filtering, we compute thescore threshold that corresponds to the user-specified p threshold.We use the score threshold to limit the number of segments that areretained in the search process. In lookahead scoring, we testintermediate scores to determine whether they will possibly exceedthe score threshold. In permuted lookahead scoring, we score eachsegment in a particular order designed to maximize the likelihood ofearly termination. Our two lookahead scoring techniques reducesubstantially the number of residues that must be examined. Thefraction of residues examined ranges from 62 to 6%, depending on thep threshold chosen by the user. These techniques permit sequenceanalysis with scoring matrices at speeds that are several timesfaster than existing programs. On a database of 12 177 alignmentblocks, our techniques permit sequence analysis at a speed of 225residues/s for a p threshold of 10−6, and 541 residues/s for ap threshold of 10−20.In order to compute the quantilefunction, we may use either an independence assumption or a Markovassumption. We measure the effect of first- and second-order Markovassumptions and find that they tend to raise the p value ofsegments, when compared with the independence assumption, by averageratios of 1.30 and 1.69, respectively. We also compare our techniquewith the empirical 99.5th percentile scores compiled in theBLOCKSPLUS database, and find that they correspond on average to a pvalue of 1.5 × 10−5.Availability: The techniques described above are implemented in asoftware package called EMATRIX.

Without additional experimental effort, this approach mustrely on the occurrence of cognate ESTs for the gene underconsideration in available, generally incomplete, EST collectionsfor the given species. In some cases, particular exon assignmentscan be supported by sequence matching even if the cDNA or EST isproduced from non-cognate genomic DNA, including different loci of agene family or homologous loci from different species. However,marginally significant sequence matching alone can also bemisleading. We sought to develop an algorithm that wouldsimultaneously score for predicted intrinsic splice site strengthand sequence matching between the genomic DNA template and a relatedcDNA or EST. In this case, weakly predicted splice sites may bechosen for the optimal scoring spliced alignment on the basis ofsurrounding sequence matching. Strongly predicted splice sites willenter the optimal spliced alignment even without strong sequencematching.Results: We designed a novel algorithm that produces the optimalspliced alignment of a genomic DNA with a cDNA or EST based onscoring for both sequence matching and intrinsic splice sitestrength. By example, we demonstrate that this combined approachappears to improve gene prediction accuracy compared with currentmethods that rely only on either search by content and signal or onsequence similarity.Availability: The algorithm is available as a C subroutine and isimplemented in theSplicePredictorandGeneSeqerprograms.

Accurate prediction of CDSs may be achieved by directlymatching the DNA sequence with a known protein sequence or profileof a homologous family member(s).Results: A new convention for encoding a DNA sequence into aseries of 23 possible letters (translated codon or tron code) wasdevised to improve this type of analysis. Using this convention, adynamic programming algorithm was developed to align a DNA sequenceand a protein sequence or profile so that the spliced and translatedsequence optimally matches the reference the same as the standardprotein sequence alignment allowing for long gaps. The objectivefunction also takes account of frameshift errors, coding potentials,and translational initiation, termination and splicing signals. Thismethod was tested on Caenorhabditis elegans genes of knownstructures. The accuracy of prediction measured in terms of acorrelation coefficient (CC) was about 95% at the nucleotide levelfor the 288 genes tested, and 97.0% for the 170 genes whose productand closest homologue share more than 30% identical amino acids.

The program provides a maximum likelihoodestimate of the rate and also the associated date of the most recentcommon ancestor of the sequences, under a model which assumes aconstant rate of substitution (molecular clock) but whichaccommodates the dates of isolation. Confidence intervals for theseparameters are also estimated.Results: The approach was applied to a sample of 17 dengue virusserotype 4 sequences, isolated at dates ranging from 1956 to 1994.The rate of substitution for this serotype was estimated to be 7.91× 10−4 substitutions per site per year (95% confidenceintervals of 6.07 × 10−4, 9.86 × 10−4). Thisis compatible with a date of 1922 (95% confidence intervals of1900–1936) for the most recent common ancestor of thesesequences.Availability: TipDate can be obtained by WWW fromhttp://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software.The package includes the source code, manual and example files.

Wolf,Simon Easteal,Margaret Kahn,Brendan D. McKay,Lars S. Jermiin	NULL	Motivation: Maximum-likelihood analysis of nucleotide and aminoacid sequences is a powerful approach for inferring phylogeneticrelationships and for comparing evolutionary hypotheses. Because itis a computationally demanding and time-consuming process, mostalgorithms explore only a minute portion of tree-space, with theemphasis on finding the most likely tree while ignoring the lesslikely, but not significantly worse, trees. However, when such treesexist, it is equally important to identify them to give dueconsideration to the phylogenetic uncertainty. Consequently, it isnecessary to change the focus of these algorithms such that nearoptimal trees are also identified.Results: This paper presents the Advanced Stepwise AdditionAlgorithmfor exploring tree-space and two algorithms forgenerating all binary trees on a set of sequences. The AdvancedStepwise Addition Algorithm has been implemented in TrExML, aphylogenetic program for maximum-likelihood analysis of nucleotidesequences. TrExML is shown to be more effective at finding nearoptimal trees than a similar program, fastDNAml, implying thatTrExML offers a better approach to account for phylogeneticuncertainty than has previously been possible. A program, TreeGen,is also described; it generates binary trees on a set of sequencesallowing for extensive exploration of tree-space using otherprograms.Availability: TreeGen, TrExML, and the sequence data used to testthe programs are available from the following two WWW sites:http://whitetail.bemidji.msus.edu/trexml/andhttp://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/dmm/humgen.html.Contact:mjwolf@whitetail.bemidji.msus.edu;Simon.Easteal@anu.edu.au;Margaret.Kahn@anu.edu.au;bdm@cs.anu.edu.au;jermiin@angis.usyd.edu.au	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/383/187232/TrExML-a-maximum-likelihood-approach-for-extensive	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.383	NULL	http://whitetail.bemidji.msus.edu/trexml/,http://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/dmm/humgen.html,http://mjwolf@whitetail.bemidji.msus.edu,http://Simon.Easteal@anu.edu.au,http://Margaret.Kahn@anu.edu.au,http://bdm@cs.anu.edu.au,http://jermiin@angis.usyd.edu.au	NULL	NULL

A new propensity scale generated from a transmembranehelix database is proposed.Results: We show that wavelet change-point performs well forsmoothing hydropathy and transmembrane profiles generated usingdifferent scales. We investigate which wavelet bases and thresholdfunctions are overall most appropriate to detect transmembranesegments. Prediction accuracy is based on the analysis of two datasets used as standard benchmarks for transmembrane predictionalgorithms. The analysis of a test set of 83 proteins results inaccuracy per segment equal to 98.2%; the analysis of a 48 proteinsblind-test set, i.e. containing proteins not used to generate thepropensity scales, results in accuracy per segment equal to 97.4%.We believe that this method can also be applied to the detection ofboundaries of other patterns such as G + Cisochores anddot-plots.Availability: The transmembrane database, TMALN and source codeare available upon request from the authors.Contact:plio@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/376/187209/Wavelet-change-point-prediction-of-transmembrane	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.376	NULL	http://plio@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

  regions in microbial genomes"	http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu	ARTICLE	3	15	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Pierre Baldi	NULL	Motivation: As the number of fully sequenced prokaryotic genomescontinues to grow rapidly, computational methods for reliablydetecting protein-coding regions become even more important. Audicand Claverie (1998)Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA,95,10026–10031, have proposed a clustering algorithm forprotein-coding regions in microbial genomes. The algorithm is basedon three Markov models of order k associated with subsequencesextracted from a given genome. The parameters of the three Markovmodels are recursively updated by the algorithm which, insimulations, always appear to converge to a unique stable partitionof the genome. The partition corresponds to three kinds of regions:(1) coding on the direct strand, (2) coding on the complementarystrand, (3) non-coding.Results: Here we provide an explanation for the convergence ofthe algorithm by observing that it is essentially a form of theexpectation maximization (EM) algorithm applied to the correspondingmixture model. We also provide a partial justification for theuniqueness of the partition based on identifiability. Other possiblevariations and improvements are briefly discussed.Contact:pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/367/187170/On-the-convergence-of-a-clustering-algorithm-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.367	NULL	http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu	NULL	NULL

Nizolenko,A. A. Yarigin	NULL	Motivation: When analysing novel protein sequences, it is nowessential to extend search strategies to include a range of‘secondary’ databases. Pattern databases have becomevital tools for identifying distant relationships in sequences, andhence for predicting protein function and structure. The maindrawback of such methods is the relatively small representation ofproteins in trial samples at the time of their construction.Therefore, a negative result of an amino acid sequence comparisonwith such a databank forces a researcher to search for similaritiesin the original protein banks. We developed a database of patternsconstructed for groups of related proteins with maximumrepresentation of amino acid sequences of SWISS-PROT in thegroups.Results: Software tools and a new method have been designed toconstruct patterns of protein families. By using such method, a newversion of databank of protein family patterns, PROF_ PAT 1.3, isproduced. This bank is based on SWISS-PROT (r1.38) and TrEMBL(r1.11), and contains patterns of more than 13 000 groups of relatedproteins in a format similar to that of the PROSITE. Motifs ofpatterns, which had the minimum level of probability to be found inrandom sequences, were selected. Flexible fast search programaccompanies the bank. The researcher can specify a similarity matrix(the type PAM, BLOSUM and other). Variable levels of similarity canbe set (permitting search strategies ranging from exact matches toincreasing levels of ‘fuzziness’).Availability: The Internet address for comparing sequences withthe bank is:http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/prof_pat/.The local version of the bank and search programs (approximately 50Mb) is available via ftp:ftp://ftp.bionet.nsc.ru/pub/biology/vector/prof_pat/,andftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/prof_pat/.Another appropriate way for its external use is to mail amino acidsequences to bachin@vector.nsc.ru for comparison with PROF_ PAT1.3.Contact:bachin@vector.nsc.ru	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/358/187126/PROF-PAT-1-3-Updated-database-of-patterns-used-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.358	NULL	http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/prof_pat/,http://bachin@vector.nsc.ru	NULL	NULL

  histograms"	http://acal@us.ibm.com,http://www.research.ibm.com/splash	ARTICLE	11	68	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Andrea Califano	NULL	Motivation: The discovery of sparse amino acid patterns thatmatch repeatedly in a set of protein sequences is an importantproblem in computational biology. Statistically significantpatterns, that is patterns that occur more frequently than expected,may identify regions that have been preserved by evolution and whichmay therefore play a key functional or structural role. Sparsenesscan be important because a handful of non-contiguous residues mayplay a key role, while others, in between, may be changed withoutsignificant loss of function or structure. Similar arguments may beapplied to conserved DNA patterns. Available sparse patterndiscovery algorithms are either inefficient or impose limitations onthe type of patterns that can be discovered.Results: This paper introduces a deterministic pattern discoveryalgorithm, called Splash, which can find sparse amino or nucleicacid patterns matching identically or similarly in a set of proteinor DNA sequences. Sparse patterns of any length, up to the size ofthe input sequence, can be discovered without significant loss inperformances.Splash is extremely efficient and embarrassinglyparallel by nature. Large databases, such as a complete genome orthe non-redundant SWISS-PROT database can be processed in a fewhours on a typical workstation. Alternatively, a protein family orsuperfamily, with low overall homology, can be analyzed to discovercommon functional or structural signatures. Some examples ofbiologically interesting motifs discovered by Splash are reportedfor the histone I and for the G-Protein Coupled Receptor families.Due to its efficiency, Splash can be used to systematically andexhaustively identify conserved regions in protein family sets.These can then be used to build accurate and sensitive PSSM or HMMmodels for sequence analysis.Availability: Splash is available to non-commercial researchcenters upon request, conditional on the signing of a test fieldagreement.Contact:acal@us.ibm.com, Splash mainpagehttp://www.research.ibm.com/splash	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/341/187100/SPLASH-structural-pattern-localization-analysis-by	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.341	NULL	http://acal@us.ibm.com,http://www.research.ibm.com/splash	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

Eddy	NULL	Motivation: In a previous paper, we presented a polynomial timedynamic programming algorithm for predicting optimal RNA secondarystructure including pseudoknots. However, a formal grammaticalrepresentation for RNA secondary structure with pseudoknots wasstill lacking.Results: Here we show a one-to-one correspondence between thatalgorithm and a formal transformational grammar. This grammar classencompasses the context-free grammars and goes beyond to generatepseudoknotted structures. The pseudoknot grammar avoids the use ofgeneral context-sensitive rules by introducing a small number ofauxiliary symbols used to reorder the strings generated by anotherwise context-free grammar. This formal representation of theresidue correlations in RNA structure is important because it meanswe can build full probabilistic models of RNA secondary structure,including pseudoknots, and use them to optimally parse sequences inpolynomial time.Contact:eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	2000-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000087933900004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/4/334/187080/The-language-of-RNA-a-formal-grammar-that-includes	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.334	NULL	http://eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	NULL	NULL

To utilize these large amounts ofdata for a biological understanding of the regulation of geneexpression, new automatic methods for pattern finding areneeded.Results: Two word-analysis algorithms for automatic discovery ofregulatory sequence elements have been developed. We show thatsequence patterns correlated to whole cell expression data can befound using Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on the raw data, therebyeliminating the need for clustering co-regulated genes. Regulatoryelements have also been identified by systematic calculations of thesignificance of correlations between words found in the functionalannotation of genes and DNA words occuring in their promoterregions.

Rodriguez-Tomé	NULL	Motivation: Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are cheap, easy andquick to obtain relative to full genomic sequencing and currentlysample more eukaryotic genes than any other data source. They areparticularly useful for developing Sequence Tag Sites (STSs formapping), polymorphism discovery, disease gene hunting, massspectrometer proteomics, and most ironically for finding genes andpredicting gene structure after the great effort of genomicsequencing. However, ESTs have many problems and the public ESTdatabases contain all the errors and high redundancy intrinsic tothe submitted data so it is often found that derived database views,which reduce both errors and redundancy, are more effective startingpoints for research than the original raw submissions. Existingderived views such as EST cluster databases and consensus databaseshave never published supporting evidence or intermediary resultsleading to difficulties trusting, correcting, and customizing thefinal published database. These difficulties have lead many groupsto wastefully repeat the complex intermediary work of others inorder to offer slightly different final views. A better approachmight be to discover the most expensive common calculations used byall the approaches and then publish all intermediary results. Givena globally accessible database with a suitable component interface,like the JESAM software described in this paper, the creation ofcustomized EST-derived databases could be achieved with minimumeffort.Results: Databases of EST and full-length mRNA sequences for fourmodel organisms have been self-compared by searching for overlapsconsistent with contiguity. The sequence comparisons are performedin parallel using a PVM process farm and previous results are storedto allow incremental updates with minimal effort. The overlapdatabases have been published with CORBA interfaces to enableflexible global access as demonstrated by example Java appletbrowsers. Simple cDNA supercluster databases built as alignmentdatabase clients are themselves published via CORBA interfacesbrowsable with prototypical applets.

To search for remote homologsin single-celled eukaryotes, we used computer software based onhidden Markov models.

Sequenceidentities betweenS.pombeAZ and known AZs are as low as18–22% in the most conserved C-terminal regions. Theauthenticity of theS.pombeAZ is validated by the presenceof a conserved nucleotide sequence that, in metazoa, promotes a +1programmed ribosomal frameshift required for AZ expression.

Bader,Christopher W. V. Hogue	NULL	*To whom correspondence should be addressed.Motivation: Proteomics is gearing up towards high-throughputmethods for identifying and characterizing all of the proteins,protein domains and protein interactions in a cell and willeventually create more recorded biological information than theHuman Genome Project. Each protein expressed in a cell can interactwith various other proteins and molecules in the course of itsfunction. A standard data specification is required that candescribe and store this information in all its detail and allowefficient cross-platform transfer of data. A complete specificationmust be the basis for any database or tool for managing andanalysing this information.Results: We have defined a complete data specification in ASN.1that can describe information about biomolecular interactions,complexes and pathways. Our group is using this data specificationin our database, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database(BIND). An interaction record is based on the interaction betweentwo objects. An object can be a protein, DNA, RNA, ligand, molecularcomplex or an interaction. Interaction description encompassescellular location, experimental conditions used to observe theinteraction, conserved sequence, molecular location, chemicalaction, kinetics, thermodynamics, and chemical state. Molecularcomplexes are defined as collections of more than two interactionsthat form a complex, with extra descriptive information such ascomplex topology. Pathways are defined as collections of more thantwo interactions that form a pathway, with additional descriptiveinformation such as cell cycle stage. A request for proposal of ahuman readable flat-file format that mirrors the BIND dataspecification is also tendered for interested parties.Availability: The ASN.1 data specification for biomolecularinteraction, molecular complex and pathway data is available atftp://bioinfo.mshri.on.ca/pub/BIND/Spec/bind.asn.An interactive browser for this document is available through ourhomepage athttp://bioinfo.mshri.on.ca/BIND/asn-browser/.Contact:hogue@mshri.on.ca	2000-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000088444600007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/5/465/192439/BIND-a-data-specification-for-storing-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.5.465	NULL	http://bioinfo.mshri.on.ca/BIND/asn-browser/,http://hogue@mshri.on.ca	NULL	NULL

We wanted to know how many sequences can be removedbefore the databases start losing homology information. Can adatabase of sequences with mutual sequence identity of 50% or lessprovide us with the same amount of biological information as theoriginal full database?Results: Comparisons of nine representative sequence databases(RSDB) derived from full protein databanks showed that theinformation content of sequence databases is not linearlyproportional to its size. An RSDB reduced to mutual sequenceidentity of around 50% (RSDB50) was equivalent to the original fulldatabase in terms of the effectiveness of homology searching. It wasa third of the full database size which resulted in a six timesfaster iterative profile searching.

Detection and correctionof false positive and negative relationships with subsequentdetection and resolution of multi-domain proteins.Results: A new algorithm for the automatic clustering of proteinsequence datasets has been developed. This algorithm represents allsimilarity relationships within the dataset in a binary matrix.Removal of false positives is achieved through subsequentsymmetrification of the matrix using a Smith–Waterman dynamicprogramming alignment algorithm. Detection of multi-domain proteinfamilies and further false positive relationships within thesymmetrical matrix is achieved through iterative processing ofmatrix elements with successive rounds of Smith–Watermandynamic programming alignments. Recursive single-linkage clusteringof the corrected matrix allows efficient and accurate familyrepresentation for each protein in the dataset. Initial clusterscontaining multi-domain families, are split into their constituentclusters using the information obtained by the multi-domaindetection step. This algorithm can hence quickly and accuratelycluster large protein datasets into families. Problems due to thepresence of multi-domain proteins are minimized, allowing moreprecise clustering information to be obtained automatically.Availability: GeneRAGE (version 1.0) executable binaries for mostplatforms may be obtained from the authors on request.

  reference point logistic regression and sequence alignment"	http://biotools.com,http://hooper@stat.ualberta.ca	ARTICLE	8	10	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Peter M. Hooper,Haiyan Zhang,David S. Wishart	NULL	*To whom correspondence should be addressed.Motivation: Current software tools are moderately effective inpredicting genetic structure (exons, introns, intergenic regions,and complete genes) from raw DNA sequence data. Improvements inaccuracy and speed are needed to deal with the increasing volume ofdata from large scale sequencing projects.Results: We present a two-stage computer program to predictgenetic structure in eukaryotic DNA. The first stage makes use of anovel statistical technique, called reference point logistic (RPL)regression, to calculate scores for potential functional sites.These site scores are combined with interval content, length, andstate scores, via a Generalized Hidden Markov Model, to determine acombined score for each possible parse of a given DNA sequence intoexons, introns, and intergenic regions. An optimal parse is foundusing a dynamic programming algorithm. In the second stage, proteinsequence alignment methods are applied to improve the accuracy ofthe initial parse. Computation in the first stage of the program isvery fast (1 s on a 360 MHz CPU for a 16 kb sequence) and itspredictive accuracy typically matches or exceeds the best resultsreported for other methods (Sensitivity = 0.93 and Specificity =0.93 for the Burset/Guigótest set).Computation in the second stage is slower, but the final predictionsare more accurate (Sn = 0.97, Sp = 0.97). The program (called GRPL)can handle partial, single, and multi-gene sequences. The program isalso capable of predicting the genetic structure of vertebrate,invertebrate, and plant DNA with nearly equal accuracy. Statisticaltechniques have also been introduced to model the effects of varyingC+G content in a continuous manner and to control overfitting ofparameters for smaller training sets.Availability: An academic implementation of GRPL, compiled forSUN workstations, is available by anonymous ftp fromsnipe.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/pub.

One solution tothis problem is to increase the efficiency of information use bymoving away from the classical browsing model for scientificinformation dissemination towards an information on demand modelwhich would allow researchers to access information quickly andefficiently only as they need it. The most common approach to thisgoal has been to use information retrieval technology to improveaccess to text databases of biomedical information. We areinterested in exploring an alternative; encoding this informationfor storage in structured databases for efficient retrieval.Results: Two small databases described here are test beds fordevelopment of structured digital publication software; the TumorGene Database, containing information about genes which are thesites for cancer-causing mutations, and the Mammary TransgeneDatabase, containing information about expression of transgenes inagriculturally important animals.

To do this, the problem of tree construction is reducedto the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The input for the TSPalgorithm are the pairwise distances of the sequences and the outputis a circular tour through the optimal, unknown tree plus theminimum score of the tree. The circular order and the score can beused to construct the topology of the optimal tree. Our method canbe used for any scoring function that correlates to the amount ofchanges along the branches of an evolutionary tree, for instance itcould also be used for parsimony scores, but it cannot be used forleast squares fit of distances. A TSP solution reduces the space ofall possible trees to2n2n2^{n}. Using this order, we canguarantee that we reconstruct a correct evolutionary tree if theabsolute value of the error for each distance measurement is smallerthanx2x2\frac{x}{2}, wherexxxis the length of the shortest edge in the tree. For datasets with large errors, a dynamic programming approach is used toreconstruct the tree. Finally simulations and experiments with realdata are shown.Availability: The software may be used via our cbrg server athttp://cbrg.inf.ethz.ch/MultAlign.Contact:chantal.roth@nobilitas.comSupplementaryinformation: An html and postscript version of this paper isavailable athttp://chantal.nobilitas.com/(Paperssection).*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2000-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000090101900006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/7/619/227913/Using-traveling-salesman-problem-algorithms-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.7.619	NULL	http://cbrg.inf.ethz.ch/MultAlign,http://chantal.roth@nobilitas.com,http://chantal.nobilitas.com/	NULL	NULL

Marchler-Bauer,S. H. Bryant	NULL	Motivation: The sizes of protein domains observed in the3D-structure database follow a surprisingly narrow distribution.Structural domains are furthermore formed from a single-chaincontinuous segment in over 80% of instances. These observationsimply that some choices of domain boundaries on an otherwiseuncharacterized sequence are more likely than others, based solelyon the size and segment number of predicted domains. This propertymight be used to guess the locations of protein domainboundaries.Results: To test this possibility we enumerate putative domainboundaries and calculate their relative likelihood under aprobability model that considers only the size and segment number ofpredicted domains. We ask, in a cross-validated test using sequenceswith known 3D structure, whether the most likely guesses agree withthe observed domain structure. We find that domain boundarypredictions are surprisingly successful for sequences up to 400residues long and that guessing domain boundaries in this way canimprove the sensitivity of threading analysis.Availability: The DGS algorithm, for ‘Domain Guess bySize’, is available as a web service athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dgs.

  significant for the detection of noncoding RNAs"	http://eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	39	175	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Elena Rivas,Sean R. Eddy	NULL	Motivation: Several results in the literature suggest thatbiologically interesting RNAs have secondary structures that aremore stable than expected by chance. Based on these observations, wedeveloped a scanning algorithm for detecting noncoding RNA genes ingenome sequences, using a fully probabilistic version of the Zukerminimum-energy folding algorithm.Results: Preliminary results were encouraging, but certainanomalies led us to do a carefully controlled investigation of thisclass of methods. Ultimately, our results argue that for theprobabilistic model there is indeed a statistical effect, but itcomes mostly from local base-composition bias and not from RNAsecondary structure. For the thermodynamic implementation (whichevaluates statistical significance by doing Monte Carlo shuffling infixed-length sequence windows, thus eliminating the base-compositioneffect) the signals for noncoding RNAs are still usuallyindistinguishable from noise, especially when certain statisticalartifacts resulting from local base-composition inhomogeneity aretaken into account. We conclude that although a distinct, stablesecondary structure is undoubtedly important in most noncoding RNAs,the stability of most noncoding RNA secondary structures is notsufficiently different from the predicted stability of a randomsequence to be useful as a general genefinding approach.Contact:eddy@genetics.wustl.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000090101900003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/7/583/227875/Secondary-structure-alone-is-generally-not	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.7.583	NULL	http://eddy@genetics.wustl.edu	NULL	NULL

Gibbs,John S. Armstrong,Adrian J. Gibbs	NULL	Motivation: To devise a method that, unlike available methods,directly measures variations in phylogenetic signals in genesequences that result from recombination, tests the significance ofthe signal variations and distinguishes misleading signals.Results: We have developed a method, that we call‘sister-scanning’, for assessing phylogenetic andcompositional signals in the various patterns of identity that occurbetween four nucleotide sequences. A Monte Carlo randomization isdone for all columns (positions) within a window andZZZ-scoresare obtained for four real sequences or three real sequences with anoutlier that is also randomized. The usefulness of the approach isdemonstrated using tobamovirus and luteovirus sequences.Contradictory phylogenetic signals were distinguished in bothdatasets, as were regions of sequence that contained no clear signalor potentially misleading signals related to compositionalsimilarities. In the tobamovirus dataset, contradictory phylogeneticsignals were separated by coding sequences up to a kilobase longthat contained no clear signal. Our re-analysis of this datasetusing sister-scanning also yielded the first evidence known to us ofan inter-species recombination site within a viral RNA-dependent RNApolymerase gene together with evidence of an unusual pattern ofconservation in the three codon positions.Availability: A program package, SiScan, for use under MS-DOS canbe downloaded fromhttp://life.anu.edu.au/with test dataand instructions.Contact:mgibbs@rsbs.anu.edu.au;johna@rsbs.anu.edu.au;gibbs@rsbs.anu.edu.au*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-07-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000090101900002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/7/573/227862/Sister-Scanning-a-Monte-Carlo-procedure-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.7.573	NULL	http://life.anu.edu.au/,http://mgibbs@rsbs.anu.edu.au,http://johna@rsbs.anu.edu.au,http://gibbs@rsbs.anu.edu.au	NULL	NULL

These coredata sets are themselves complex, and present challenges to thosewho seek to store, analyse and present the information. However, inaddition to the sequence data, high throughput experiments aremaking available distinctive new data sets on protein interactions,the phenotypic consequences of gene deletions, and on thetranscriptome, proteome, and metabolome. The effective descriptionand management of such data is of considerable importance tobioinformatics in the post-genomic era. The provision of clear andintuitive models of complex information is surprisingly challenging,and this paper presents conceptual models for a range of importantemerging information resources in bioinformatics. It is hoped thatthese can be of benefit to bioinformaticians as they attempt tointegrate genetic and phenotypic data with that from genomicsequences, in order to both assign gene functions and elucidate thedifferent pathways of gene action and interaction.Results: This paper presents a collection of conceptual (i.e.implementation-independent) data models for genomic data.

However, it is difficult to obtain a consistent set ofvalues for the parameters that characterize such a model. Even whena set of parameter values exists, the accuracy of the individualvalues is questionable. Therefore, we were motivated to explorestatistical techniques for analyzing the properties of a given modelwhen knowledge of the actual parameter values is lacking.Results: The graphical and statistical methods presented in theprevious paper are applied here to simple unbranched biosyntheticpathways subject to control by feedback inhibition. We representthese pathways within a canonical nonlinear formalism that providesa regular structure that is convenient for randomly sampling theparameter space. After constructing a large ensemble of randomlygenerated sets of parameter values, the structural and behavioralproperties of the model with these parameter sets are examinedstatistically and classified. The results of our analysisdemonstrate that certain properties of these systems are stronglycorrelated, thereby revealing aspects of organization that arehighly probable independent of selection.

A substantial number of methods for the classificationhave been proposed, and several databases have been constructedusing these methods. Since some proteins with very similar sequencesmay exhibit structural diversities, we have proposed PDB-REPRDB: adatabase of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank(PDB), which strategy of selection is based not only on sequencesimilarity but also on structural similarity. Forty-eightrepresentative sets whose similarity criteria were predeterminedwere made available over the World Wide Web (WWW). However, the setswere insufficient in number to satisfy users researching proteinstructures by various methods.Result: We have improved thesystem for PDB-REPRDB so that the user may obtain a quick selectionof representative chains from PDB. The selection of representativechains can be dynamically configured according to the user’srequirement.

947	"Phylogenetically enhanced statistical tools for RNA structure
  prediction"	http://slava@colorado.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	4	35	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Viatcheslav R. Akmaev,Scott T. Kelley,Gary D. Stormo	NULL	Motivation: Methods that predict the structure of molecules bylooking for statistical correlation have been quite effective.Unfortunately, these methods often disregard phylogeneticinformation in the sequences they analyze. Here, we present a numberof statistics for RNA molecular-structure prediction. Besides commonpair-wise comparisons, we consider a few reasonable statistics forbase-triple predictions, and present an elaborate analysis of thesemethods. All these statistics incorporate phylogenetic relationshipsof the sequences in the analysis to varying degrees, and thedifferent nature of these tests gives a wide choice of statisticaltools for RNA structure prediction.Results: Starting from statistics that incorporate phylogeneticinformation only as independent sequence evolution models for eachposition of a multiple alignment, and extending this idea to a jointevolution model of two positions, we enhance the usual purelystatistical methods (e.g. methods based on the Mutual Informationstatistic) with the use of phylogenetic information available in thesequences. In particular, we present a joint model based on the HKYevolution model, and consequently aχ2χ2{\chi}^{2}test ofindependence for two positions. A significant part of this work isdevoted to some mathematical analysis of these methods. We testedthese statistics on regions of 16S and 23S rRNA, and tRNA.Availability: The programs are available upon request.Contact:slava@colorado.edu	2000-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000089451500003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/6/501/177970/Phylogenetically-enhanced-statistical-tools-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.6.501	NULL	http://slava@colorado.edu	NULL	NULL

Next, a qualitativenetwork model is proposed, in which regulation rules are representedas qualitative rules and embedded in the network structure.Algorithms are also presented for inferring qualitative relationsfrom time series data. Then, an algorithm for inferring S-systems(synergistic and saturable systems) from time series data ispresented, where S-systems are based on a particular kind ofnonlinear differential equation and have been applied to theanalysis of various biological systems. Theoretical results areshown for Boolean networks with noises and simple qualitativenetworks. Computational results are shown for Boolean networks withnoises and S-systems, where real data are not used because theproposed models are still conceptual and the quantity and quality ofcurrently available data are not enough for the application of theproposed methods.Contact:takutsu@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jpTo whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165377300007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/8/727/190308/Inferring-qualitative-relations-in-genetic	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.727	NULL	http://takutsu@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp	NULL	NULL

The ultimatechoice of sequence-search algorithm is that of Smith–Waterman.However, because of the computationally demanding nature of thismethod, heuristic programs or special-purpose hardware alternativeshave been developed. Increased speed has been obtained at the costof reduced sensitivity or very expensive hardware.Results: A fast implementation of the Smith–Watermansequence-alignment algorithm using Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data(SIMD) technology is presented. This implementation is based on theMultiMedia eXtensions (MMX) and Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE)technology that is embedded in Intel’s latest microprocessors.Similar technology exists also in other modern microprocessors.Six-fold speed-up relative to the fastest previously knownSmith–Waterman implementation on the same hardware wasachieved by an optimized 8-way parallel processing approach. A speedof more than 150 million cell updates per second was obtained on asingle Intel Pentium III 500 MHz microprocessor.

Christian Overton,Saul Surrey,Christian J. Stoeckert Jr.	NULL	Motivation: A protocol is described to attach expression patternsto genes represented in a collection of hybridization arrayexperiments. Discrete values are used to provide an easilyinterpretable description of differential expression. Binningcutoffs for each sample type are chosen automatically, depending onthe desired false-positive rate for the predictions of differentialexpression. Confidence levels are derived for the statement thatchanges in observed levels represent true changes in expression. Wehave a novel method for calculating this confidence, which givesbetter results than the standard methods. Our method reflects thebroader change of focus in the field from studying a few genes withmany replicates to studying many (possibly thousands) of genessimultaneously, but with relatively few replicates. Our approachdiffers from standard methods in that it exploits the fact thatthere are many genes on the arrays. These are used to estimate foreach sample type an appropriate distribution that is employed tocontrol the false-positive rate of the predictions made.Satisfactory results can be obtained using this method with as fewas two replicates.Results: The method is illustrated through applications tomacroarray and microarray datasets. The first is an erythroiddevelopment dataset that we have generated using nylon filterarrays. Clones for genes whose expression is known in these cellswere assigned expression patterns which are in accordance with whatwas expected and which are not picked up by the standards methods.Moreover, genes differentially expressed between normal and leukemiccells were identified. These included genes whose expression wasaltered upon induction of the leukemic cells to differentiate. Thesecond application is to the microarray data by Alizadehetal.(2000).

Curtis Jamison,James W. Thomas,Eric D. Green	NULL	Motivation: The construction of physical maps based on bacterialclones [e.g. bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)] is valuablefor a number of molecular genetics applications, including thehigh-resolution mapping of genomic regions of interest and theidentification of clones suitable for systematic sequencing. Acommon approach for large-scale screening of bacterial clonelibraries involves the hybridization of high-density arrays ofimmobilized, lysed colonies with collections of DNA probes. The useof a multiplex hybridization screening strategy, whereby pooledprobes are analysed en masse, simplifies the effort by reducing thetotal number of parallel experiments required. However, thisapproach generates large amounts of hybridization-based data thatmust be carefully analysed, assimilated, and disambiguated in acareful but efficient manner.Results: To facilitate the screening of high-density clone arraysby a multiplex hybridization approach, we have written a programcalled ComboScreen. This program provides an organizationalframework and analytical tools required for the high-throughputhybridization screening of clone arrays with pools of probes.

960	A systematic approach to dynamic programming in bioinformatics	http://robert@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de	REVIEW	33	30	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Robert Giegerich	NULL	Motivation: Dynamic programming is probably the most popularprogramming method in bioinformatics. Sequence comparison, generecognition, RNA structure prediction and hundreds of other problemsare solved by ever new variants of dynamic programming. Currently,the development of a successful dynamic programming algorithm is amatter of experience, talent and luck. The typical matrix recurrencerelations that make up a dynamic programming algorithm are intricateto construct, and difficult to implement reliably. No generalproblem independent guidance is available.Results: This article introduces a systematic method forconstructing dynamic programming solutions to problems inbiosequence analysis. By a conceptual splitting of the algorithminto a recognition and an evaluation phase, algorithm development issimplified considerably, and correct recurrences can be derivedsystematically. Without additional effort, the method produces anearly, executable prototype expressed in a functional programminglanguage. The method is quite generally applicable, and, whileprogramming effort decreases, no overhead in terms of ultimateprogram efficiency is incurred.Contact:robert@techfak.uni-bielefeld.deWork partially supported by a grant from theAustralian National University.	2000-08-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165377300002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/8/665/190161/A-systematic-approach-to-dynamic-programming-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.665	NULL	http://robert@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de	NULL	NULL

In order to solve the task of computingmultiple alignments in affordable time, the most commonly usedmultiple alignment methods have to use heuristics. Nevertheless, thecomputation ofoptimalmultiple alignments is important inits own right, and it provides a means of evaluating heuristicapproaches or serves as a subprocedure of heuristic alignmentmethods.Results: We present an algorithm that uses the divide-and-conqueralignment approach together with recent results on search spacereduction to speed up the computation of multiple sequencealignments. The method is adaptive in that depending on the time onewants to spend on the alignment, a better, up to optimal alignmentcan be obtained. To speed up the computation in the optimalalignment step, we apply theA∗A∗\mathcal{A}^{*}algorithmwhich leads to a procedure provably more efficient than previousexact algorithms.

  include numerical comparisons"	http://savageau@umich.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	10	47	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Rui Alves,Michael A. Savageau	NULL	Motivation: The method of mathematically controlled comparisonhas been used for some time to determine which of two alternativeregulatory designs is better according to specific quantitativecriteria for functional effectiveness. In some cases, the resultsobtained using this technique are general and independent ofparameter values and the answers are clear-cut. In others, theresult might be general, but the demonstration is difficult andnumerical results with specific parameter values can help to clarifythe situation. In either case, numerical results with specificparameter values can also provide an answer to the question of howmuch larger the values might be. In contrast, a more ambiguousresult is obtained when either of the alternatives can have thelarger value for a given systemic property, depending on thespecific values of the parameters. In any case, introduction ofspecific values for the parameters reduces the generality of theresults. Therefore, we have been motivated to develop and applystatistical methods that would permit the use of numerical valuesfor the parameters and yet retain some of the generality that makesmathematically controlled comparison so attractive.Results: We illustrate this new numerical method in astep-by-step application using a very simple didactic example. Wealso validate the results by comparison with the correspondingresults obtained using the previously developed analytical method.The analytical approach is briefly present for reference purposes,since some of the same key concepts are needed to understand thenumerical method and the results are needed for comparison. Thenumerical method confirms the qualitative differences between thesystemic behavior of alternative designs obtained from theanalytical method. In addition, the numerical method allows forquantification of the differences and it provides results that aregeneral in a statistical sense. For example, the older analyticalmethod showed that overall feedback inhibition in an unbranchedpathway makes the system more robust whereas it decreases thestability margin of the steady state. The numerical method showsthat the magnitudes of these differences are not comparable. Thedifferences in stability margins (1–2% on average) are smallwhen compared to the differences in robustness (50–100% onaverage). Furthermore, the numerical method shows that the systemwith overall feedback responds more quickly to change than theotherwise equivalent system without overall feedback. These resultssuggest reasons why overall feedback inhibition is such a prevalentregulatory pattern in unbranched biosynthetic pathways.Contact:savageau@umich.eduTo whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165748700005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/9/786/307648/Extending-the-method-of-mathematically-controlled	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.9.786	NULL	http://savageau@umich.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

Because thisproblem is not trivial, a large number of different assessmentmeasures have been proposed by various authors, and it has alreadybecome an active subfield of research (Moultet al.(1999)Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction(CASP): round III.Proteins, Suppl32–6). TheCASP (Moultet al.(1997) Critical assessment of methods ofproteins structure prediction (CASP): round II.Proteins,Suppl3, Dedicated Issue, Moultet al.(1999)Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction(CASP): round III.Proteins, Suppl32–6) andCAFASP (Fischeret al.(1999) CAFASP-1: critical assessmentof fully automated structure prediction methods.Proteins,Suppl3, 209–217) prediction experiments havedemonstrated that it has been difficult to choose one single,‘best’ method to be used in the evaluation.Consequently, the CASP3 evaluation was carried out using anextensive set of especially developed numerical measures, coupledwith human-expert intervention. As part of our efforts towards ahigher level of automation in the structure prediction field, herewe investigate the suitability of a fully automated, simple,objective, quantitative and reproducible method that can be used inthe automatic assessment of models in the upcoming CAFASP2experiment. Such a method should (a) produce one single number thatmeasures the quality of a predicted model and (b) perform similarlyto human-expert evaluations.Results: MaxSub is a new and independently developed method thatfurther builds and extends some of the evaluation methods introducedat CASP3. MaxSub aims at identifying the largest subset ofCαCαC_{{\alpha}}atoms of a model that superimpose‘well’ over the experimental structure, and produces asingle normalized score that represents the quality of the model.Because there exists no evaluation method for assessment measures ofpredicted models, it is not easy to evaluate how good our newmeasure is. Even though an exact comparison of MaxSub and the CASP3assessment is not straightforward, here we use a test-bed extractedfrom the CASP3 fold-recognition models. A rough qualitativecomparison of the performance of MaxSub vis-a-vis the human-expertassessment carried out at CASP3 shows that there is a good agreementfor the more accurate models and for the better predicting groups.As expected, some differences were observed among the medium to poormodels and groups. Overall, the top six predicting groups rankedusing the fully automated MaxSub are also the top six groups rankedat CASP3. We conclude that MaxSub is a suitable method for theautomatic evaluation of models.Availability: MaxSub is available at:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.htmlContact: {nomsiew,dfischer}@cs.bgu.ac.il;arne@biokemi.su.se;leszek@iimcb.gov.plSupplementaryInformation: Full tables are available at:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/∼∼{\sim}dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.html CASPweb site:http://PredictionCenter.llnl.gov/casp3/CAFASPweb site:http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/CAFASP2To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165748700004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/9/776/307645/MaxSub-an-automated-measure-for-the-assessment-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.9.776	NULL	http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/MaxSub/MaxSub.html,http://arne@biokemi.su.se,http://leszek@iimcb.gov.pl,http://PredictionCenter.llnl.gov/casp3/,http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dfischer/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

The QFC algorithmuses concise statistical variables as the ‘featurespace’ to characterize the quasi-periodic physico-chemicalproperties of multi-transmembrane proteins. For the case ofidentifying GPCRs, the variables are then used in a non-parametriclinear discriminant function to separate GPCRs from non-GPCRs. Thealgorithm runs in time linearly proportional to the number ofsequences, and performance on a test dataset shows 96% positiveidentification of known GPCRs. The QFC algorithm also works wellwith short random segments of proteins and it positively identifiedGPCRs at a level greater than 90% even with segments as short as 100amino acids. The primary advantage of the algorithm is that it doesnot directly use primary sequence patterns which may be subject tosampling bias. The utility of the new algorithm has beendemonstrated by the isolation from the Drosophila genome projectdatabase of a novel class of seven-transmembrane proteins which wereshown to be the elusive olfactory receptor genes of Drosophila.Availability: C++/Perl available fromhttp://jkim.eeb.yale.edu/index.htmlContact: Junhyong Kim, Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,Yale University, P.O.

We have developed Ballast, a program to predictlocal maximum segments (LMSs—i.e. sequence segments conservedrelatively to their flanking regions) from a single Blast databasesearch and to highlight these divergent homologues. The TBlastNdatabase searches can also be processed with the help of informationfrom a joint BlastP search.Results: We have applied the Ballast algorithm to BlastP searchesperformed with sequences belonging to well described dispersedfamilies (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; helicases) against theSwissProt 38 database. We show that Ballast is able to build anappropriate conservation profile and that LMSs are predicted thatare consistent with the signatures and motifs described in theliterature. Furthermore, by comparing the Blast, PsiBlast andBallast results obtained on a well defined database of structurallyrelated sequences, we show that the LMSs provide a scoring schemethat can concentrate on top ranking distant homologues better thanBlast.

  genome data"	http://p.lio@zoo.cam.ac.uk	ORIGINAL PAPER	10	48	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Pietro Liò,Marina Vannucci	NULL	Motivation: There is a growing literature on wavelet theory andwavelet methods showing improvements on more classical techniques,especially in the contexts of smoothing and extraction offundamental components of signals. G+Cpatterns occur atdifferent lengths (scales) and, for this reason, G+Cplotsare usually difficult to interpret. Current methods for genomeanalysis choose a window size and compute aχ2χ2{\chi}^{2}statistics of the average value for eachwindow with respect to the whole genome.Results: Firstly, wavelets are used to smoothG+Cprofiles to locate characteristic patterns in genomesequences. The method we use is based on performing aχ2χ2{\chi}^{2}statistics on the wavelet coefficients of aprofile; thus we do not need to choose a fixed window size, in thatthe smoothing occurs at a set of different scales. Secondly, awavelet scalogram is used as a measure for sequence profilecomparison; this tool is very general and can be applied to othersequence profiles commonly used in genome analysis. We showapplications to the analysis ofDeinococcus radioduranschromosome I, of two strains ofHelicobacter pylori(26695,J99) and two ofNeisseria meningitidis(serogroup B strainMC58 and serogroup A strain Z2491). We report a list of loci thathave different G+Ccontent with respect to the nearbyregions; the analysis ofN. meningitidisserogroup B showstwo new large regions with low G+Ccontent that are putativepathogenicity islands.Availability: Software and numerical results (profiles,scalograms, high and low frequency components) for all the genomesequences analyzed are available upon request from the authors.Contact:p.lio@zoo.cam.ac.ukTo whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165954000009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/10/932/223642/Finding-pathogenicity-islands-and-gene-transfer	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.10.932	NULL	http://p.lio@zoo.cam.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Kreil,Christophe Leroy,Stavros Hamodrakas,Chris Sander,Christos A. Ouzounis	NULL	Motivation: Sensitive detection and masking of low-complexityregions in protein sequences. Filtered sequences can be used insequence comparison without the risk of matching compositionallybiased regions. The main advantage of the method over similarapproaches is the selective masking of single residue types withoutaffecting other, possibly important, regions.Results: A novel algorithm for low-complexity region detectionand selective masking. The algorithm is based on multiple-passSmith–Waterman comparison of the query sequence against twentyhomopolymers with infinite gap penalties. The output of thealgorithm is both the masked query sequence for further analysis,e.g. database searches, as well as the regions of low complexity.The detection of low-complexity regions is highly specific forsingle residue types. It is shown that this approach is sufficientfor masking database query sequences without generating falsepositives. The algorithm is benchmarked against widely availablealgorithms using the 210 genes ofPlasmodium falciparumchromosome 2, a dataset known to contain a large number oflow-complexity regions.Availability: CAST (version 1.0) executable binaries areavailable to academic users free of charge under license.

We have developed a newmethod to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines(SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissuesamples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled orquestionable tissue results.Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samplesconsisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, andother normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experimentresults for 97802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result ofcomputational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmedto be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and theremoval of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues isachieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse asubset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highlydifferentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness ofthe SVM method, two previously published datasets from other typesof tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable tothose previously obtained.

Schmitt,Matthias Steinfath,John O’Brien,Henrik Seidel,Sebastian Meier-Ewert,Hans Lehrach,Uwe Radelof	NULL	Motivation: The choice of probes is an important feature ofhybridisation experiments. In this paper we present an algorithmthat optimises probes with respect to a training set of sequencesbased on Shannon entropy as a quality criterion. The practicalmotivation for our algorithm is oligonucleotide fingerprinting, amethod for the simultaneous identification of sequences (cDNA orgenomic DNA) by their hybridisation tags according to a set of shortprobes such as octamers, although the algorithm is of course notrestricted to that application.Results: We can show that our method is superior to the selectionof probes according to their frequencies, which is a widely usedstrategy, and to randomly chosen probe sets. The quality of probesets is assessed by a simulation pipeline that entails the set ofprobes as a simulation parameter. The performance of probe setstrained on sequences from different organisms shows additionallythat probes should be chosen with regard to the organism underanalysis. Case studies are presented on how constraints (G+CG+C\mathrm{G\ +\ C}-content, complexity of the individual probes) influencethe selection process.Availability: A description of the oligonucleotide fingerprintingpipeline is published on our web-pagehttp://www.molgen.mpg.de/~ag_onf/met.htm.An executable of the algorithm and probe lists designed for humanand rodents can be downloaded from the ftp-siteftp://ftp.molgen.mpg.de/pub/mpimg/probe_design/.Contact:herwig@molgen.mpg.deTo whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165954000004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/10/890/223501/Information-theoretical-probe-selection-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.10.890	NULL	http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~ag_onf/met.htm,http://herwig@molgen.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

  sequences and repeats of all lengths"	http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://baisnee@ics.uci.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	9	32	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Pierre Baldi,Pierre-François Baisnée	NULL	Motivation: DNA structure plays an important role in a variety ofbiological processes. Different di- and tri-nucleotide scales havebeen proposed to capture various aspects of DNA structure includingbase stacking energy, propeller twist angle, protein deformability,bendability, and position preference. Yet, a general framework forthe computational analysis and prediction of DNA structure is stilllacking. Such a framework should in particular address the followingissues: (1) construction of sequences with extremal properties; (2)quantitative evaluation of sequences with respect to a given genomicbackground; (3) automatic extraction of extremal sequences andprofiles from genomic databases; (4) distribution and asymptoticbehavior as the length Nof the sequences increases; and (5)complete analysis of correlations between scales.Results: We develop a general framework for sequence analysisbased on additive scales, structural or other, that addresses allthese issues. We show how to construct extremal sequences andcalibrate scores for automatic genomic and database extraction. Weshow that distributions rapidly converge to normality asNincreases. Pairwise correlations between scales dependboth on background distribution and sequence length and rapidlyconverge to an analytically predictable asymptotic value. For di-and tri-nucleotide scales, normal behavior and asymptoticcorrelation values are attained over a characteristic window lengthof about 10–15 bp. With a uniform background distribution,pairwise correlations between empirically-derived scales remainrelatively small and roughly constant at all lengths, except forpropeller twist and protein deformability which are positivelycorrelated. There is a positive (resp. negative) correlation betweendinucleotide base stacking (resp. propeller twist and proteindeformability) and AT-content that increases in magnitude withlength. The framework is applied to the analysis of various DNAtandem repeats. We derive exact expressions for counting the numberof repeat unit classes at all lengths. Tandem repeats are likely toresult from a variety of different mechanisms, a fraction of whichis likely to depend on profiles characterized by extreme structuralfeatures.Contact:pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu;baisnee@ics.uci.eduTo whom all correspondence should beaddressed.	2000-10-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000165954000003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/10/865/223470/Sequence-analysis-by-additive-scales-DNA-structure	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.10.865	NULL	http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://baisnee@ics.uci.edu	NULL	NULL
987	Bioinorganic motifs: towards functional classification of   metalloproteins	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~kirill/biometal/	REVIEW	35	50	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Kirill Degtyarenko	NULL	The habitat of bioinorganic motifs (BIMs) is at the interfaceof biological inorganic chemistry and bioinformatics. BIM is definedas a common structural feature shared by functionally related, butnot necessarily homologous, proteins, and consisting of the metalatom(s) and first coordination shell ligands. BIMs appear to besuitable for classification of metal centres at any level, fromgroups of unrelated proteins with similar function to differentfunctional states of the same protein, and for description ofpossible evolutionary relationships of metalloproteins. However, theyhave not attracted wide attention from the bioinformatics community.Although their presence is appreciated, they are difficult topredict—therefore the current ‘high-throughput’initiatives are likely to miss or ignore them altogether. The proteinsequence databases do not distinguish between proteins containingdifferent prosthetic groups (unless they have different sequences) orbetween apo- and holoprotein. On the other hand, the proteinstructure databases include data on ‘hetero compounds’ ofvarious origin but these data are often inconsistent. A number ofspecialized databases dealing with BIMs and attempts to classify them are reviewed.

Acomputer program is presented, Fels-Rand, that performs suchanalyses. A randomisation procedure is used to generate trees thatare fully resolved but whose structure is consistent with theoriginal tree.

Levy	NULL	Motivation: Sequence alignment techniques have been developedinto extremely powerful tools for identifying the folding familiesand function of proteins in newly sequenced genomes. For asufficiently low sequence identity it is necessary to incorporateadditional structural information to positively detect homologousproteins. We have carried out an extensive analysis of theeffectiveness of incorporating secondary structure informationdirectly into the alignments for fold recognition and identificationof distant protein homologs. A secondary structure similarity matrixbased on a database of three-dimensionally aligned proteins wasfirst constructed. An iterative application of dynamic programmingwas used which incorporates linear combinations of amino acid andsecondary structure sequence similarity scores. Initially, onlyprimary sequence information is used. Subsequently contributionsfrom secondary structure are phased in and new homologous proteinsare positively identified if their scores are consistent with thepredetermined error rate.Results: We used the SCOP40 database, where only PDB sequencesthat have 40% homology or less are included, to calibrate homologydetection by the combined amino acid and secondary structuresequence alignments. Combining predicted secondary structure withsequence information results in a 8–15% increase in homologydetection within SCOP40 relative to the pairwise alignments usingonly amino acid sequence data at an error rate of 0.01 errors perquery; a 35% increase is observed when the actual secondarystructure sequences are used. Incorporating predicted secondarystructure information in the analysis of six small genomes yields animprovement in the homology detection of∼∼{\sim}20% overSSEARCH pairwise alignments, but no improvement in the total numberof homologs detected over PSI-BLAST, at an error rate of 0.01 errorsper query. However, because the pairwise alignments based oncombinations of amino acid and secondary structure similarity aredifferent from those produced by PSI-BLAST and the error rates canbe calibrated, it is possible to combine the results of bothsearches. An additional 25% relative improvement in the number ofgenes identified at an error rate of 0.01 is observed when the datais pooled in this way. Similarly for the SCOP40 dataset, PSI-BLASTdetected 15% of all possible homologs, whereas the pooled resultsincreased the total number of homologs detected to 19%. Theseresults are compared with recent reports of homology detection usingsequence profiling methods.Availability: Secondary structure alignment homepage athttp://lutece.rutgers.edu/ssasContact:anders@rutchem.rutgers.edu;ronlevy@lutece.rutgers.eduSupplementaryInformation: Genome sequence/structure alignment results athttp://lutece.rutgers.edu/ss˙fold˙predictions.To whom correspondence should beaddressed.**Presentaddress: Genomic Science Laboratory, RIKEN Life Science TsukubaCenter, 3-1-1 Koya-dai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.	2000-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000166343700005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/11/988/216393/Iterative-sequence-secondary-structure-search-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/16.11.988	NULL	http://lutece.rutgers.edu/ssas,http://anders@rutchem.rutgers.edu,http://ronlevy@lutece.rutgers.edu,http://lutece.rutgers.edu/ss\|[dot]\|fold\|[dot]\|predictions	NULL	NULL

Statistical information ofshort nucleotide fragments was fully exploited in the predictionalgorithm. However, sequence similarities to known proteins, whichare becoming increasingly available due to recent rapid growth ofprotein database, were not used in the prediction. In this work, wepresent a new prediction algorithm based on both statistical andsimilarity information, which provides better performance insensitivity and specificity.Results: We evaluated the accuracy of ATGpr for predictingfullness of cDNA sequences from human clustered ESTs of UniGene, andwe obtained specificity, sensitivity, and correlation coefficient ofthis prediction. Specificity and sensitivity crossed at 46% over theATGpr score threshold of 0.33 and the maximum correlationcoefficient of 0.34 was obtained at this threshold. Without ATGpr wefound it effective to use alignments with known proteins forpredicting the fullness of cDNA sequences. That is, specificityincreased monotonously as similarity (identity of the alignments)increased. Specificity was achieved greater than 80% if identity wasgreater than 40%. For more effective prediction of fullness of cDNAsequences we combined the similarity (identity of query sequence)with known proteins and ATGpr score. As a result, specificity becamegreater than 80% if identity was greater than 20%.Availability: The prediction program, called ATGpr_ sim, isavailable athttp://www.hri.co.jp/atgpr/ATGpr˙sim.htmlContact:nisikawa@crl.hitachi.co.jpTo whom correspondence should beaddressed.**Presentaddress: Biosystems Research Department, Central ResearchLaboratory, Hitachi Ltd, 1-280 Higashi-Koigakubo, Kokubunji-shi,Tokyo, 185-8601, Japan.***Present address: Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co.

Several statistical tests have been developed to detectsignificant differences in tag frequency between two samples.However, which one of these tests has the greatest power to detectreal changes remains undetermined.Results: This paper compares three statistical tests fordetecting significant changes of gene expression in SAGEexperiments. The comparison makes use of Monte Carlo simulationthat, in essence, generates ‘virtual’ SAGE experiments.Our analysis shows that the Chi-square test has the best power androbustness.

Interestingly, those genes areclustered in Thermus, nevertheless they are scattered inDeinococcus. A similar gene cluster has only been found inPyrococcus. However, the phylogenetic analyses indicatedthat the deduced gene products fromDeinococcuswere themost closely related to the proteins encoded in the Thermus genecluster for lysine biosynthesis. Therefore, those genes had not beentransferred horizontally betweenPyrococcusandThermus. It is strongly suggested that a common ancestor ofDeinococcusandThermuspossessed the genes forlysine biosynthesis through the aminoadipate pathway. These had beenclustered through the evolution ofThermusor had beenscattered from the gene cluster through the evolution ofDeinococcus.

Therefore, new methods and tools forextracting more biological information from homology searches wouldbe advantageous.Results: We have developed a computational tool, ORI-GENE, toanalyze the results of sequence homology searches from theperspective of the evolution of selected sets of new genes. ORI-GENEhas a graphical interface and accomplishes two important tasks:first, based on the output of homology searches, it identifiesspecies with similar genes and displays their pattern ofdistribution on the phylogenetic tree. This function enables one toinfer the way in which a given gene may have propagated amongspecies over time. Second, from the distribution patterns, itpredicts the point at which a given gene may have been firstacquired (i.e. its ‘origin’), then classifies the geneon that basis. Because it makes use of available evolutionaryinformation to show the way in which genes cluster among species,ORI-GENE should be an effective tool for the screening andclassification of new genes revealed by genome analysis.Availability: ORI-GENE is retrievable via the Internet at:http://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/jouhou/ORI-GENE.Contact:hideaki.mizuno@roche.com;sarai@rtc.riken.go.jp*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.4Presentaddress: Nippon Roche Research Center, 200 Kajiwara, Kamakura,Kanagawa 249-8530, Japan.	2001-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000167396800008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/2/167/182181/ORI-GENE-gene-classification-based-on-the	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.2.167	NULL	http://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/jouhou/ORI-GENE,http://hideaki.mizuno@roche.com,http://sarai@rtc.riken.go.jp	NULL	NULL

DNA array technologies allow monitoringthousands of genes rapidly and efficiently. One of the interests ofthese studies is the search for correlated gene expression patterns,and this is usually achieved by clustering them. The Self-OrganisingTree Algorithm, (SOTA) (Dopazo,J. and Carazo,J.M. (1997)J. Mol.Evol.,44, 226–233), is a neural network thatgrows adopting the topology of a binary tree. The result of thealgorithm is a hierarchical cluster obtained with the accuracy androbustness of a neural network.Results: SOTA clustering confers several advantages overclassical hierarchical clustering methods. SOTA is a divisivemethod: the clustering process is performed from top to bottom, i.e.the highest hierarchical levels are resolved before going to thedetails of the lowest levels. The growing can be stopped at thedesired hierarchical level. Moreover, a criterion to stop thegrowing of the tree, based on the approximate distribution ofprobability obtained by randomisation of the original data set, isprovided. By means of this criterion, a statistical support for thedefinition of clusters is proposed. In addition, obtaining averagegene expression patterns is a built-in feature of the algorithm.Different neurons defining the different hierarchical levelsrepresent the averages of the gene expression patterns contained inthe clusters.Since SOTA runtimes are approximately linearwith the number of items to be classified, it is especially suitablefor dealing with huge amounts of data. The method proposed is verygeneral and applies to any data providing that they can be coded asa series of numbers and that a computable measure of similaritybetween data items can be used.Availability: A server running the program can be found at:http://bioinfo.cnio.es/sotarrayContact:jdopazo@cnio.es*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-02-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000167396800003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/2/126/182096/A-hierarchical-unsupervised-growing-neural-network	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.2.126	NULL	http://bioinfo.cnio.es/sotarray,http://jdopazo@cnio.es	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=wwwwdddd	NULL

For those papers determined to discuss this topic, therelevant information can be captured for the Database of InteractingProteins. Furthermore, suitable gene annotations can also becaptured.Results: Our Bayesian approach scores Medline abstracts forprobability of discussing the topic of interest according to thefrequencies of discriminating words found in the abstract.

Ding,Inna Dubchak	NULL	Motivation: Protein fold recognition is an important approach tostructure discovery without relying on sequence similarity. We studythis approach with new multi-class classification methods andexamined many issues important for a practical recognitionsystem.Results: Most current discriminative methods for protein foldprediction use the one-against-others method, which has thewell-known ‘False Positives’ problem. We investigatedtwo new methods: the unique one-against-others and theall-against-all methods. Both improve prediction accuracy by14–110% on a dataset containing 27 SCOP folds. We used theSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and the Neural Network (NN) learningmethods as base classifiers. SVMs converges fast and leads to highaccuracy. When scores of multiple parameter datasets are combined,majority voting reduces noise and increases recognition accuracy. Weexamined many issues involved with large number of classes,including dependencies of prediction accuracy on the number of foldsand on the number of representatives in a fold. Overall, recognitionsystems achieve 56% fold prediction accuracy on a protein testdataset, where most of the proteins have below 25% sequence identitywith the proteins used in training.Supplementary information:The protein parameter datasets used in this paper are availableonline (http://www.nersc.gov/~cding/protein).Contact:chqding@lbl.gov;ildubchak@lbl.gov*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168325600008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/4/349/328221/Multi-class-protein-fold-recognition-using-support	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.4.349	NULL	http://www.nersc.gov/~cding/protein,http://chqding@lbl.gov,http://ildubchak@lbl.gov	NULL	NULL

Sonnhammer	NULL	Motivation: Multi-domain proteins have evolved by insertions ordeletions of distinct protein domains. Tracing the history of acertain domain combination can be important for functionalannotation of multi-domain proteins, and for understanding thefunction of individual domains. In order to analyze the evolutionaryhistory of the domains in modular proteins it is desirable toinspect a phylogenetic tree based on sequence divergence with themodular architecture of the sequences superimposed on thetree.Result: A Java applet, NIFAS, that integrates graphicaldomain schematics for each sequence in an evolutionary tree wasdeveloped. NIFAS retrieves domain information from the Pfam databaseand uses CLUSTAL W to calculate a tree for a given Pfam domain. Thetree can be displayed with symbolic bootstrap values, and to allowthe user to focus on a part of the tree, the layout can be alteredby swapping nodes, changing the outgroup, and showing/collapsingsubtrees. NIFAS is integrated with the Pfam database and isaccessible over the internet (http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam).

  alignment"	http://ppevzner@cs.ucsd.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	36	53	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Abdullah N. Arslan,Ömer Eğecioğlu,Pavel A. Pevzner	NULL	The Smith–Waterman algorithm for local sequencealignment is one of the most important techniques in computationalmolecular biology. This ingenious dynamic programming approach wasdesigned to reveal the highly conserved fragments by discardingpoorly conserved initial and terminal segments. However, the existingnotion of local similarity has a serious flaw: it does not discardpoorly conserved intermediate segments. The Smith–Watermanalgorithm finds the local alignment with maximalscorebutit is unable to find local alignment with maximumdegreeofsimilarity (e.g. maximal percent of matches). Moreover, there isstill no efficient algorithm that answers the following naturalquestion: do two sequences share a (sufficiently long) fragment withmore than 70% of similarity? As a result, the local alignmentsometimes produces a mosaic of well-conserved fragments artificiallyconnected by poorly-conserved or even unrelated fragments. This maylead to problems in comparison of long genomic sequences andcomparative gene prediction as recently pointed out by Zhangetal.(Bioinformatics,15, 1012–1019,1999). In this paper we propose a new sequence comparison algorithm(normalized local alignment) that reports the regions withmaximum degree of similarity. The algorithm is based on fractionalprogramming and its running time isO(n2logn)O(n2logn)O(n^{2}\mathrm{log}n). In practice, normalized localalignment is only 3–5 times slower than the standardSmith–Waterman algorithm.Contact: {arslan,omer}@cs.ucsb.edu;ppevzner@cs.ucsd.edu	2001-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168325600005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/4/327/328203/A-new-approach-to-sequence-comparison-normalized	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.4.327	NULL	http://ppevzner@cs.ucsd.edu	NULL	NULL

We provide a systematic framework forassessing the results of clustering algorithms. Clusteringalgorithms attempt to partition the genes into groups exhibitingsimilar patterns of variation in expression level. Our methodologyis to apply a clustering algorithm to the data from all but oneexperimental condition. The remaining condition is used to assessthe predictive power of the resulting clusters—meaningfulclusters should exhibit less variation in the remaining conditionthan clusters formed by chance.Results: We successfully applied our methodology to compare sixclustering algorithms on four gene expression data sets. We foundour quantitative measures of cluster quality to be positivelycorrelated with external standards of cluster quality.Availability: The software is under development.Contact:kayee@cs.washington.eduSupplementaryinformation:http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/clusterorhttp://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ruzzo/cluster*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168325600003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/4/309/328189/Validating-clustering-for-gene-expression-data	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.4.309	NULL	http://kayee@cs.washington.edu,http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/cluster,http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ruzzo/cluster	NULL	NULL

Gibson,B. Brunk,J. Crabtree,J. Schug,S. Shen-Orr,G. C. Overton	NULL	Motivation and Results: A relational schema is described forcapturing highly parallel gene expression experiments usingdifferent technologies. This schema grew out of efforts to build adatabase for collaborators working on different biological systemsand using different types of platforms in their gene expressionexperiments as well as different types of image quantificationsoftware. The tables are conceptually organized into threecategories of information: Platform, Experiment (which includesimage scanning and quantification), and Data. The strengths of theschema are: (i) integrating information on array elements using agene index; (ii) describing samples using ontologies; (iii) reducingan experiment to a single RNA source for precise descriptions yetnot losing the relationships between experiments done at the sametime or for the same project; and (iv) maintaining both raw andprocessed (e.g. cleansed and normalized) data and recording how thedata is processed. The result is a novel schema, which can hold botharray and non-array data, is extensible for detailed experimentaldescriptions that are precise and consistent, and allows formeaningful comparisons of genes between experiments.Availability: The schema is available athttp://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/RAD2/schemaBrowserRAD.pl.Contact:stoeckrt@pcbi.upenn.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.2Presentaddress: Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute ofScience, Israel.	2001-04-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168325600002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/4/300/328181/A-relational-schema-for-both-array-based-and-SAGE	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.4.300	NULL	http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/RAD2/schemaBrowserRAD.pl,http://stoeckrt@pcbi.upenn.edu	NULL	NULL

This paper presentsPicasso, a procedure for deriving a minimal set of protein familyprofiles that cover all known protein sequences.Results: Picasso starts from highly overlapping sequenceneighbourhoods revealed by all-on-all pairwise Blast alignment.Overlaps are reduced by merging sequences or parts of sequences intomultiple alignments. For maximum unification, the multiplealignments must reach into the twilight zone of sequence similarity.Sensitive and selective profile–profile comparison allowsunification down to about 15% pairwise sequence identity. Familiesunified through a short conserved sequence motif are associated withmultiple full-length alignments describing different subfamilies.Domains that are mobile modules are identified based on theirassociation with different sets of neighbours. The result is 10000unified domain families (excluding singletons) representingfunctionally related proteins and recovering classical prolificdomain types in high numbers.

T. Silverstein,Elizabeth Shoop,James E. Johnson,Ernest F. Retzel	NULL	Motivation: Protein sequence classification is becoming anincreasingly important means of organizing the voluminous dataproduced by large-scale genome sequencing projects. At present,there are several independent classification methods. To aid thegeneral classification effort, we have created a unified proteinfamily resource, MetaFam. MetaFam is a protein family classificationbuilt upon 10 publicly-accessible protein family databases(Blocks+++, DOMO, Pfam, PIR-ALN, PRINTS, PROSITE, ProDom,PROTOMAP, SBASE, and SYSTERS). MetaFam’s family‘supersets’, as we call them, are created automaticallyusing set-theory to compare families among the databases. Familiesof one database are matched to those in another when theintersection of their members exceeds all other possible familypairings between the two databases. Pairwise family matches aredrawn together transitively to create a new list of protein familysupersets.Results: MetaFam family supersets have several useful features:(1) each superset contains more members than the families from whichit is composed, because each of the component family databases onlyworks with a subset of our full non-redundant set of proteins; (2)conflicting assignments can be pinpointed quickly, since ouranalysis identifies individual members that are in conflict with themajority consensus; (3) family descriptions that are absent fromautomated databases can frequently be assigned; (4) statistics havebeen computed comparing domain boundaries, family sizedistributions, and overall quality of MetaFam supersets; (5) thesupersets have been loaded into a relational database to allow forcomplex queries and visualization of the connections among familiesin a superset and the consensus of individual domain members; and(6) the quality of individual supersets has been assessed usingnumerous quantitative measures such as family consistency,connectedness, and size.

DNA, however, contains avariety of other signals related, for instance, to reading frame,codon bias, pairwise codon bias, splice sites and transcriptionregulation, nucleosome positioning and DNA structure. Here we studythe relationship between the genetic code and DNA structure andaddress two questions. First, to which degree does the degeneracy ofthe genetic code and the acceptable amino acid substitution patternsallow for the superimposition of DNA structural signals to proteincoding sequences? Second, is the origin or evolution of the geneticcode likely to have been constrained by DNA structure?Results: We develop an index for code flexibility with respect toDNA structure. Using five different di- or tri-nucleotide models ofsequence-dependent DNA structure, we show that the standard geneticcode provides a fair level of flexibility at the level of broadamino acid categories. Thus the code generally allows for thesuperimposition of any structural signal on any protein-codingsequence, through amino acid substitution. The flexibility observedat the level of single amino acids allows only for thesuperimposition of punctual and loosely positioned signals toconserved amino acid sequences. The degree of flexibility of thegenetic code is low or average with respect to several classes ofalternative codes. This result is consistent with the view that DNAstructure is not likely to have played a significant role in theorigin and evolution of the genetic code.Contact:pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu;baisnee@ics.uci.edu;brunak@cbs.dtu.dk;gorm@cbs.dtu.dk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168053800004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/3/237/189536/Flexibility-of-the-genetic-code-with-respect-to	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.3.237	NULL	http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://baisnee@ics.uci.edu,http://brunak@cbs.dtu.dk,http://gorm@cbs.dtu.dk	NULL	NULL

Most formal grammars in this field are expressedusing Definite Clause Grammars but these have computationallimitations which must be overcome. The present study provides a newDNA parsing system, comprising a logic grammar formalism calledBasic Gene Grammars and a bidirectional chart parserDNA-ChartParser.Results: The use of Basic Gene Grammars is demonstrated inrepresenting many formulations of the knowledge of Escherichia colipromoters, including knowledge acquired from human experts,consensus sequences, statistics (weight matrices), symboliclearning, and neural network learning. The DNA-ChartParser providesbidirectional parsing facilities for BGGs in handling overlappingcategories, gap categories, approximate pattern matching, andconstraints.

This entails a design approach from multicriteriadecision making. Values of some of the criteria are easy to computewhile others require intense calculations.Results: The reference point method was found to be tractable fortrading-off between deviations from ideal values of all thecriteria. Some criteria computations are based on dynamic programswith value iteration whose run time can be bounded by a low-degreepolynomial. For designing standard PCR primers, the scheme offers ina relative gain in computing speed of up to50:150:150\ :\ 1over ad-hoccomputational methods. Single PCR primer pairs have been used asmodel systems in order to simplify the quantization of thecomputational acceleration factors. The program has been structuredso as to facilitate the analysis of large numbers of primer pairswith minor modifications. The scheme significantly increases primerdesign throughput which in turn facilitates the use ofoligonucleotides in a wide range of applications including:multiplex PCR and other nucleic acid-based amplification systems, aswell as in zip code targeting, oligonucleotide microarrays andnucleic acid-based nanoengineering.Availability: A public version of the software DOPRIMER isaccessible underhttp://doprimer.interactiva.deContact:kaempke@faw.uni-ulm.de	2001-03-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168053800002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/3/214/189493/Efficient-primer-design-algorithms	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.3.214	NULL	http://doprimer.interactiva.de,http://kaempke@faw.uni-ulm.de	NULL	NULL
1053	Physical mapping with automatic capture of hybridization data	http://suchi@cs.uga.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	0	3	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	David Hall,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,Jonathan Arnold,Tongzhang Jiang	NULL	Motivation: Contig maps are a type of physical map that show thenative order of a set of overlapping genomic clones. Overlapsbetween clones can be detected by finding common sequences using anumber of experimental protocols including hybridization of probes.All current mapping algorithms of which we are aware require thathybridizations be scored using a fixed number of discrete values(typically 0/1 or high/medium/low). When hybridization data iscaptured automatically using digital equipment, this provides theopportunity for hybridization intensities to be used in mapconstruction. More fine-grained distinctions in the levels ofhybridization may be exploited by algorithms to generate moreaccurate physical maps.Results: We describe an approach to creating contig maps thatuses measured hybridization intensities instead of data scored witha fixed number of discrete values. We describe and compare fouralgorithms for creating physical maps with hybridizationintensities.

1056	A graph layout algorithm for drawing metabolic pathways	http://mywyb2@cam.ac.uk	ORIGINAL PAPER	67	57	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Moritz Y. Becker,Isabel Rojas	NULL	Motivation: A large amount of data on metabolic pathways isavailable in databases. The ability to visualise the complex datadynamically would be useful for building more powerful researchtools to access the databases. Metabolic pathways are typicallymodelled as graphs in which nodes represent chemical compounds, andedges represent chemical reactions between compounds. Thus, theproblem of visualising pathways can be formulated as a graph layoutproblem. Currently available visual interfaces to biochemicaldatabases either use static images or cannot cope well with morecomplex, non-standard pathways.Results: This paper presents a new algorithm for drawing pathwayswhich uses a combination of circular, hierarchic and force-directedgraph layout algorithms to compute positions of the graph elementsrepresenting main compounds and reactions. The algorithm isparticularly designed for cyclic or partially cyclic pathways or forcombinations of complex pathways. It has been tested on five samplepathways with promising results.Availability: On request from the authors.Contact:mywyb2@cam.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should be addressed at:Trinity College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TQ,UK.	2001-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168750700011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/5/461/277434/A-graph-layout-algorithm-for-drawing-metabolic	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.461	NULL	http://mywyb2@cam.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

  structure"	http://dgough@bioeng.ucsd.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	212	330	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Joel R. Bock,David A. Gough	NULL	Motivation: An ambitious goal of proteomics is to elucidate thestructure, interactions and functions of all proteins within cellsand organisms. The expectation is that this will provide a fullerappreciation of cellular processes and networks at the proteinlevel, ultimately leading to a better understanding of diseasemechanisms and suggesting new means for intervention. This paperaddresses the question: can protein–protein interactions bepredicted directly from primary structure and associated data? Usinga diverse database of known protein interactions, a Support VectorMachine (SVM) learning system was trained to recognize and predictinteractions based solely on primary structure and associatedphysicochemical properties.Results: Inductive accuracy of the trained system, defined hereas the percentage of correct protein interaction predictions forpreviously unseen test sets, averaged 80% for the ensemble ofstatistical experiments.

DMP works even inthe absence of a homologous protein of known function. Weinvestigate the utility of different ways of representing proteinsequence in DMP (residue frequencies, phylogeny, predictedstructure) using theEscherichia coligenome as amodel.Results: Using the different representations DMP learntprediction rules that were more accurate than default at every levelof function using every type of representation.

   A. Carriço,António Maretzek,Peter A. Noble,Madilyn Fletcher"	NULL	Motivation: Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is an iterativemapping technique that processes sequences of units, such asnucleotides in a DNA sequence or amino acids in a protein, in orderto find the coordinates for their position in a continuous space.This distribution of positions has two properties: it is unique, andthe source sequence can be recovered from the coordinates such thatdistance between positions measures similarity between thecorresponding sequences. The possibility of using the latterproperty to identify succession schemes have been entirelyoverlooked in previous studies which raises the possibility that CGRmay be upgraded from a mere representation technique to a sequencemodeling tool.Results: The distribution of positions in the CGR plane wereshown to be a generalization of Markov chain probability tables thataccommodates non-integer orders. Therefore, Markov models areparticular cases of CGR models rather than the reverse, as currentlyaccepted. In addition, the CGR generalization has both practical(computational efficiency) and fundamental (scale independence)advantages. These results are illustrated by usingEscherichiacoliK-12 as a test data-set, in particular, the genesthrA,thrBandthrCof the threonineoperon.Availability: A web page interface has been created whereanalyses of arbitrary sequences by CGR can be performed on-line(http://www.itqb.unl.pt:1111/biomat/resources/resources.htm).The test data-set used in this report is also included.Contact:almeidaj@musc.edu;mfletcher@biol.sc.edu	2001-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168750700007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/5/429/277428/Analysis-of-genomic-sequences-by-Chaos-Game	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.429	NULL	http://www.itqb.unl.pt:1111/biomat/resources/resources.htm,http://almeidaj@musc.edu,http://mfletcher@biol.sc.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Chan	NULL	Motivation: Almost all methods of chromosome recognition assumesupervised training; i.e. we are given correctly classifiedchromosomes to start the training phase. Noise, if any, is confinedonly in the representation of the chromosomes and not in theclassification of the chromosomes. During the recognition phase, theproblem is simply to calculate the string edit distance of theunknowns to the representatives chosen from the training phase andclassify the unknowns accordingly.Results: In this paper, a general method to tackle the difficultunsupervised induction problem is described. The success of themethod is demonstrated by showing how the inductive agent learnsweights in a dynamic manner that allows it to distinguish betweennoisy median and telocentric chromosomes without knowing theirproper labels. The process of learning is characterized as theprocess of finding the right distance function, i.e. the distancefunction that can nicely separate the classes.Contact:t-chan@u-aizu.ac.jp	2001-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168750700008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/5/438/277429/Unsupervised-classification-of-noisy-chromosomes	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.438	NULL	http://t-chan@u-aizu.ac.jp	NULL	NULL

Performing such comparisons entails finding many shortlocal alignments between sequences up to tens of megabases inlength. To process such long sequences efficiently, existingalgorithms find alignments by expanding around short runs ofmatching bases with no substitutions or other differences.Unfortunately, exact matches that are short enough to occur often insignificant alignments also occur frequently by chance in thebackground sequence. Thus, these algorithms must trade off betweenefficiency and sensitivity to features without long exactmatches.Results: We introduce a new algorithm,lsh-all-pairs,to find ungapped local alignments in genomic sequence with up to aspecified fraction of substitutions. The length and substitutionrate of these alignments can be chosen so that they appearfrequently in significant similarities yet still remain rare in thebackground sequence. The algorithm finds ungapped alignmentsefficiently using a randomized search technique,locality-sensitive hashing.

A major problem is obtainingthe region of interest from the stored sequences, which oftencontain but are not limited to that region. In addition, multiplealignment programs generally cannot deal with the large numbers ofsequences that are available for many HIV-1 regions. We set out toprovide our users with a tool that will retrieve and create aninitial alignment of the HIV sequences that are available for agiven genomic region.Results: The MPAlign (MultiplePairwiseAlignment) web interface is a collection of Perl scripts thatretrieves sequences from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database basedon a number of search parameters. All sequences werepairwise-aligned to a model sequence using the Hidden MarkovModel-based program HMMER. The HMMER model is general enough toaccommodate virtually all HIV-1 sequences stored in the database. Tocreate a multiple sequence alignment, gaps were inserted into thesequences during retrieval, so that they are aligned to one another.Retrieving and aligning the almost 560 gp120 sequences(∼∼{\sim}1500 nt) stored in the database is at least 1500 timesfaster than a similar Clustal alignment.Availability: Athttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov/Contact: Brian Gaschen atbkg@lanl.gov*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168750700005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/5/415/277426/Retrieval-and-on-the-fly-alignment-of-sequence	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.415	NULL	http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/,http://bkg@lanl.gov	NULL	NULL

Lukashin,Rainer Fuchs	NULL	Motivation: Cluster analysis of genome-wide expression data fromDNA microarray hybridization studies has proved to be a useful toolfor identifying biologically relevant groupings of genes andsamples. In the present paper, we focus on several important issuesrelated to clustering algorithms that have not yet been fullystudied.Results: We describe a simple and robust algorithm for theclustering of temporal gene expression profiles that is based on thesimulated annealing procedure. In general, this algorithm guaranteesto eventually find the globally optimal distribution of genes overclusters. We introduce an iterative scheme that serves to evaluatequantitatively the optimal number of clusters for each specific dataset. The scheme is based on standard approaches used in regularstatistical tests. The basic idea is to organize the search of theoptimal number of clusters simultaneously with the optimization ofthe distribution of genes over clusters. The efficiency of theproposed algorithm has been evaluated by means of a reverseengineering experiment, that is, a situation in which the correctdistribution of genes over clusters is knowna priori. Theemployment of this statistically rigorous test has shown that ouralgorithm places greater than 90% genes into correct clusters.Finally, the algorithm has been tested on real gene expression data(expression changes during yeast cell cycle) for which thefundamental patterns of gene expression and the assignment of genesto clusters are well understood from numerous previous studies.Availability: The source code of the program implementing thealgorithm is available upon request from the authors.Contact:alex_lukashin@biogen.com*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-05-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000168750700004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/5/405/277425/Analysis-of-temporal-gene-expression-profiles	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.405	NULL	http://alex_lukashin@biogen.com	NULL	NULL

  microarray data"	http://brettin@lanl.gov,http://home.lanl.gov/svdman	APPLICATIONS NOTE	39	58	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Michael E. Wall,Patricia A. Dyck,Thomas S. Brettin	NULL	Summary: We have developed two novel methods for SingularValue Decomposition analysis (SVD) of microarray data. The first is athreshold-based method for obtaining gene groups, and the second is amethod for obtaining a measure of confidence in SVD analysis. Genegroups are obtained by identifying elements of the left singularvectors, or gene coefficient vectors, that are greater in magnitudethan the thresholdWN−1/2WN−1/2WN^{{-}1/2}, whereNNNisthe number of genes, andWWWis a weight factor whose defaultvalue is 3. The groups are non-exclusive and may contain genes ofopposite (i.e. inversely correlated) regulatory response. Theconfidence measure is obtained by systematically deleting assays fromthe data set, interpolating the SVD of the reduced data set toreconstruct the missing assay, and calculating the Pearsoncorrelation between the reconstructed assay and the original data.This confidence measure is applicable when each experimental assaycorresponds to a value of parameter that can be interpolated, such astime, dose or concentration. Algorithms for the grouping method andthe confidence measure are available in a software application calledSVD Microarray ANalysis (SVDMAN). In addition to calculating the SVDfor generic analysis, SVDMAN provides a new means for usingmicroarray data to develop hypotheses for gene associations andprovides a measure of confidence in the hypotheses, thus extendingcurrent SVD research in the area of global gene expressionanalysis.Availability:ftp://bpublic.lanl.gov/compbio/softwareContact:brettin@lanl.govSupplementaryinformation:http://home.lanl.gov/svdman*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/566/272389/SVDMAN-singular-value-decomposition-analysis-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.566	NULL	http://brettin@lanl.gov,http://home.lanl.gov/svdman	NULL	NULL

Ward	NULL	Motivation: The completion of theArabidopsisgenomeoffers the first opportunity to analyze all of the membrane proteinsequences of a plant. The majority of integral membrane proteinsincluding transporters, channels, and pumps contain hydrophobicαα{\alpha}-helices and can be selected based on TransMembraneSpanning (TMS) domain prediction. By clustering the predictedmembrane proteins based on sequence, it is possible to sort themembrane proteins into families of known function, based onexperimental evidence or homology, or unknown function. Thisprovides a way to identify target sequences for future functionalanalysis.Results: An automated approach was used to select potentialmembrane protein sequences from the set of all predicted proteinsand cluster the sequences into related families. The recentlycompleted sequence ofArabidopsis thaliana, a model plant,was analyzed. Of the 25470 predicted protein sequences 4589 (18%)were identified as containing two or more membrane spanning domains.The membrane protein sequences clustered into 628 distinct familiescontaining 3208 sequences. Of these, 211 families (1764 sequences)either contained proteins of known function or showed homology toproteins of known function in other species. However, 417 families(1444 sequences) contained only sequences with no known function andno homology to proteins of known function. In addition, 1381sequences did not cluster with any family and no function could beassigned to 1337 of these.Availability: Results from the analysis of all proteins ofA.thaliana, source code for the programs, and links toprimary data are available at the following WWW site:http://www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsisContact:jward@tc.umn.edu	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/560/272387/Identification-of-novel-families-of-membrane	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.560	NULL	http://www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis,http://jward@tc.umn.edu	NULL	NULL

However,there is no ideal method for the identification of their limits. Inmost algorithms their length depends on the number of family membersand definitions of secondary structure.Results: The algorithm SCORE steps away from the conventionaldefinitions of the core to identify from large numbers of basisstructures those regions that can be considered structurally relatedto a target sequence. The use ofϕ,ψϕ,ψ{\phi},\ {\psi}constraints toaccurately pinpoint the regions that are conserved across a familyand environmentally constrained substitution tables to extend theseregions allows SCORE to rapidly (generally in under 1 s, an order ofmagnitude faster than methods such as MODELLER) identify and buildthe core of homology models from the alignments of the targetsequence to the basis structures. The SCORE algorithm was used tobuild 114 model cores. In only two cases was the core size less than50% of the structure and all the cores built had an RMSD of 3.7Âor less to the target structure.Availability: The algorithm is available upon request.Contact:charlotte@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/541/272375/SCORE-predicting-the-core-of-protein-models	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.541	NULL	http://charlotte@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Karp,Suzanne Paley,Jingchun Zhu	NULL	Problem statement: We have studied the relationships amongSWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and GenBank with two goals. First is to determinewhether users can reliably identify those proteins in SWISS-PROTwhose functions were determined experimentally, as opposed toproteins whose functions were predicted computationally. If thisinformation was present in reasonable quantities, it would allowresearchers to decrease the propagation of incorrect functionpredictions during sequence annotation, and to assemble training setsfor developing the next generation of sequence-analysis algorithms.Second is to assess the consistency between translated GenBanksequences and sequences in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.Results: (1) Contrary to claims by the SWISS-PROT authors, weconclude that SWISS-PROT does not identify a significant number ofexperimentally characterized proteins. (2) SWISS-PROT is moreincomplete than we expected in that version 38.0 from July 1999lacks many proteins from the full genomes of important organismsthat were sequenced years earlier. (3) Even if we combine SWISS-PROTand TrEMBL, some sequences from the full genomes are missing fromthe combined dataset. (4) In many cases, translated GenBank genes donot exactly match the corresponding SWISS-PROT sequences, forreasons that include missing or removed methionines, differingtranslation start positions, individual amino-acid differences, andinclusion of sequence data from multiple sequencing projects. Forexample, results show that forEscherichia coli, 80.6% ofthe proteins in the GenBank entry for the complete genome haveidentical sequence matches with SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL sequences, 13.4%have exact substring matches, and matches for 4.1% can be foundusing BLAST search; the remaining 2.0% ofE.coliproteinsequences (most of which are ORFs) have no clear matches toSWISS-PROT/TrEMBL. Although many of these differences can beexplained by the complexity of the DB, and by the curation processesused to create it, the scale of the differences is notable.Contact:pkarp@ai.sri.com*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/526/272368/Database-verification-studies-of-SWISS-PROT-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.526	NULL	http://pkarp@ai.sri.com	NULL	NULL

Altman	NULL	Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generatedata sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately,many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a completematrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such ashierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust tomissing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missingvalues. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, tominimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and toincrease the range of data sets to which these algorithms can beapplied. In this report, we investigate automated methods forestimating missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several methods forthe estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. Weimplemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular ValueDecomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearestneighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methodsusing a variety of parameter settings and over different real datasets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to theamount of missing data over the range of 1–20% missing values.We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust andsensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, andboth SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row averagemethod (as well as filling missing values with zeros).

The first level of analysis of these patterns requiresdetermining whether observed differences in expression aresignificant or not. Current methods are unsatisfactory due to thelack of a systematic framework that can accommodate noise,variability, and low replication often typical of microarraydata.Results: We develop a Bayesian probabilistic framework formicroarray data analysis. At the simplest level, we modellog-expression values by independent normal distributions,parameterized by corresponding means and variances with hierarchicalprior distributions. We derive point estimates for both parametersand hyperparameters, and regularized expressions for the variance ofeach gene by combining the empirical variance with a localbackground variance associated with neighboring genes. An additionalhyperparameter, inversely related to the number of empiricalobservations, determines the strength of the background variance.Simulations show that these point estimates, combined with at-test, provide a systematic inference approach thatcompares favorably with simplet-test or fold methods, andpartly compensate for the lack of replication.Availability: The approach is implemented in software calledCyber-T accessible through a Web interface atwww.genomics.uci.edu/software.html.The code is available as Open Source and is written in the freelyavailable statistical language R.Contact:pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu;tdlong@uci.edu*To whom correspondence should beaddressed.3Also atDepartment of Biological Chemistry, College of Medicine, Universityof California, Irvine.	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/509/272363/A-Bayesian-framework-for-the-analysis-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.509	NULL	http://www.genomics.uci.edu/software.html,http://pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu,http://tdlong@uci.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

Conversion of overlap data to probe-like dataelements would facilitate comparison and uniform integration ofoverlap data and probe data using software developed for analysis ofSTS data.Results: We show that overlap data can be effectively convertedto probe-like data elements by extracting maximal sets of mutuallyoverlapping clones. We call these setsvirtual probes,since each set determines a site in the genome corresponding to theregion which is common among the clones of the set. Finding thevirtual probes is equivalent to finding the maximal cliques of agraph. We modify a known maximal-clique algorithm such that it findsall virtual probes in a large dataset within minutes. We illustratethe algorithm by converting fingerprint and Alu-PCR overlap data tovirtual probes. The virtual probes are then analyzed usingdouble-linkage intersection graphs and structure graphs to show thatmethods designed for STS data are also applicable to overlap datarepresented as virtual probes. Next we show that virtual probes canproduce a uniform integration of different kinds of mapping data, inparticular STS probe data and fingerprint and Alu-PCR overlap data.The integrated virtual probes produce longer double-linkage contigsthan STS probes alone, and in conjunction with structure graphs theyfacilitate the identification and elimination of anomalies. Thus,the virtual-probe technique provides: (i) a new way to examineoverlap data; (ii) a basis on which to compare overlap data andprobe data using the same systems and standards; and (iii) a uniqueand useful way to uniformly integrate overlap data with probedata.Availability: Freely available on request.Contact:eharley@cs.toronto.edu	2001-06-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000169404700002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/6/487/272360/Uniform-integration-of-genome-mapping-data-using	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.6.487	NULL	http://eharley@cs.toronto.edu	NULL	NULL

Researchers have looked for various types ofsignals around the transcriptional start site (TSS), viz.oligo-nucleotide statistics, potential binding sites for corefactors, clusters of binding sites, proximity to CpG islands etc..The proximity of CpG islands to gene starts is now a well establishedfact, although until recently, it was based on very little genomicdata. In this work we explore the possibility of enhancing thepromoter prediction accuracy by combining CpG island information witha few other, biologically motivated, seemingly independent signals,that cover most of the known knowledge. We benchmarked the method ona much larger genomic datasets compared to previous studies. We wereable to improve slightly upon current prediction accuracy.Furthermore, we observe that CpG islands are the most dominantsignals and the other signals do not improve the prediction. Thissuggests that the computational prediction of promoters for geneswith no associated CpG-island (typically having tissue-specificexpression) looking only at the immediate neighborhood of the TSS maynot even be possible. We suggest some biological experiments andstudies to better understand the biology of transcription.Contact:Sridhar.Hannenhalli@celera.com;Samuel.Levy@celera.com	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS90%2f261673	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S90/261673/Promoter-prediction-in-the-human-genome	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S90	NULL	http://Sridhar.Hannenhalli@celera.com,http://Samuel.Levy@celera.com	NULL	NULL
1086	An insight into domain combinations	http://apic@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk	ORIGINAL PAPER	24	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Gordana Apic,Julian Gough,Sarah A. Teichmann	NULL	Domains are the building blocks of all globular proteins,and are units of compact three-dimensional structure as well asevolutionary units. There is a limited repertoire of domain families,so that these domain families are duplicated and combined indifferent ways to form the set of proteins in a genome. Proteins aregene products. The processes that produce new genes are duplicationand recombination as well as gene fusion and fission. We attempt togain an overview of these processes by studying the structuraldomains in the proteins of seven genomes from the three kingdoms oflife: Eubacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. We use here the domain andsuperfamily definitions in Structural Classification of ProteinsDatabase (SCOP) in order to map pairs of adjacent domains in genomesequences in terms of their superfamily combinations. We find 624 outof the 764 superfamilies in SCOP in these genomes, and the 624families occur in 585 pairwise combinations. Most families areobserved in combination with one or two other families, while a fewfamilies are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour. Thistype of pattern can be described by a scale-free network. Finally, westudy domain repeats and we compare the set of the domaincombinations in the genomes to those in PDB, and discuss theimplications for structural genomics.Contact:apic@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS83%2f261633	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S83/261633/An-insight-into-domain-combinations	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S83	NULL	http://apic@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk	NULL	NULL

Many methods have been described that identify sequencemotifs enriched in transcription control regions of genes that sharesimilar gene expression patterns. Here we present an alternativeapproach that evaluates the transcriptional information contained byspecific sequence motifs by computing for each motif the meanexpression profile of all genes that contain the motif in theirtranscription control regions. These genome-mean expression profiles(GMEP’s) are valuable for visualizing the relationship betweengenome sequences and gene expression data, and for characterizing thetranscriptional importance of specific sequence motifs. Analysis ofGMEP’s calculated from a dataset of 519 whole-genome microarrayexperiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show a significantcorrelation between GMEP’s of motifs that are reversecomplements, a result that supports the relationship betweenGMEP’s and transcriptional regulation. Hierarchical clusteringof GMEP’s identifies clusters of motifs that correspond tobinding sites of well-characterized transcription factors.

Given areference partitionthatapproximates the correct clustering of the samples, our featurefiltering procedure ranks the features according to their intrinsicdiscriminability, relevance to the reference partition, andirredundancy to other relevant features, and uses this ranking toselect the features to be used in the following round of clustering.Our clustering algorithm, which is based on the concept of anormalized cut, clusters the samples into a new reference partitionon the basis of the selected features.

Thusthe motivation to develop the first interaction-based proteininteraction map prediction algorithm.A technique to predictprotein-protein interaction maps across organisms is introduced, the‘interaction-domain pair profile’ method. The method usesa high-quality protein interaction map with interaction domaininformation as input to predict an interaction map in anotherorganism. It combines sequence similarity searches with clusteringbased on interaction patterns and interaction domain information. Weapply this approach to the prediction of an interaction map ofEscherichia coli from the recently published interaction map of thehuman gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Results are compared withpredictions of a second inference method based only on full-lengthprotein sequence similarity — the “naive” method.The domain-based method is shown to i) eliminate a significant amountof false-positives of the naive method that are the consequences ofmulti-domain proteins; ii) increase the sensitivity compared to thenaive method by identifying new potential interactions.Availability: Contact the authors.Contact:vschachter@hybrigenics.fr	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS296%2f262498	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S296/262498/Protein-protein-interaction-map-inference-using	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S296	NULL	http://vschachter@hybrigenics.fr	NULL	NULL

Blackwell	NULL	Physical map assembly is the inference of genome structurefrom experimental data. Map assembly depends on the integration ofdiverse data including sequence tagged site (STS) marker content,clone sizing, and restriction digest fingerprints (RDF). Asexperimentally measured data, these are uncertain and error prone.Physical map assembly from error free data is straightforward and canbe accomplished in linear time in the number of clones, but theassembly of an optimal map from error prone data is an NP-hardproblem. We present an alternative approach to physical map assemblythat is based on a probabilistic view of the data and seeks toidentify those features of the map that can be reliably inferred fromthe available data. With this approach, we achieve a number of goals.These include the use of multiple data sources, appropriaterepresentation of uncertainties in the underlying data, the use ofclone length information in fingerprint map assembly, and the use ofhigher order information in map assembly. By higher orderinformation, we mean relationships that are not expressible in termsof neighbouring clone relationships. These include triplet andmultiple clone overlaps, the uniqueness of STS position, andfingerprint marker locations. In a probabilistic view of physicalmapping, we assert that all of the many possible map assemblies areequally likely a priori. Given experimental data, we can only statewhich assemblies are more likely than others given the experimentalobservations. Parameters of interest are then derived as likelihoodweighted averages over map assemblies. Ideally these averages shouldbe sums or integrals over all possible map assemblies, butcomputationally this is not feasible for real-world map assemblyproblems. Instead, sampling is used to asymptotically approach thedesired parameters. Software implementing our probabilistic approachto mapping has been written. Assembly of mixed RDF and STS mapscontaining up to 60 clones can be accomplished on a desktop PC withrun times under an hour.Availability:http://stl.wustl.edu/software/gibbsmap/Contact:states@ccb.wustl.edu	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS262%2f262404	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S262/262404/Probabilistic-approaches-to-the-use-of-higher	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S262	NULL	http://stl.wustl.edu/software/gibbsmap/,http://states@ccb.wustl.edu	NULL	NULL

To circumvent theseshortcomings, we propose the use of a single coherent probabilisticmodel, that encompasses much of the rich structure in the genomicexpression data, while incorporating additional information such asexperiment type, putative binding sites, or functional information.We show how this model can be learned from the data, allowing us todiscover patterns in the data and dependencies between the geneexpression patterns and additional attributes. The learned modelrevealscontext-specificrelationships, that exist only overa subset of the experiments in the dataset. We demonstrate the powerof our approach on synthetic data and on two real-world geneexpression data sets for yeast. For example, we demonstrate a novelfunctionality that falls naturally out of our framework: predictingthe “cluster” of the array resulting from a gene mutationbased only on the gene’s expression pattern in the context ofother mutations.Contact:eran@cs.stanford.edu	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS243%2f262333	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S243/262333/Rich-probabilistic-models-for-gene-expression	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S243	NULL	http://eran@cs.stanford.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Here weuse an ensemble of bi-directional recurrent neural networkarchitectures and evolutionary information to improve thestate-of-the-art in contact prediction using a large corpus ofcurated data. The ensemble is used to discriminate between twodifferent states of residue contacts, characterized by a contactnumber higher or lower than the average value of the residuedistribution. The ensemble achieves performances ranging from 70.1%to 73.1% depending on the radius adopted to discriminate contacts(6Âto12Â). These performances representgains of 15% to 20% over the base line statistical predictors alwaysassigning an aminoacid to the most numerous state, 3% to 7% betterthan any previous method.

Pevzner,Haixu Tang	NULL	For the last twenty years fragment assembly was dominatedby the “overlap - layout - consensus” algorithms that areused in all currently available assembly tools. However, the limitsof these algorithms are being tested in the era of genomic sequencingand it is not clear whether they are the best choice for large-scaleassemblies. Although the “overlap - layout - consensus”approach proved to be useful in assembling clones, it facesdifficulties in genomic assemblies: the existing algorithms makeassembly errors even in bacterial genomes. We abandoned the“overlap - layout - consensus” approach in favour of anew Eulerian Superpath approach that outperforms the existingalgorithms for genomic fragment assembly (Pevzneret al.2001 InProceedings of the Fifth Annual InternationalConference on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB-01),256–26). In this paper we describe our new EULER-DB algorithmthat, similarly to the Celera assembler takes advantage of clone-endsequencing by using the double-barreled data. However, in contrast tothe Celera assembler, EULER-DB does not mask repeats but uses theminstead as a powerful tool for contig ordering. We also describe anew approach for the Copy Number Problem: “How many times agiven repeat is present in the genome?”. For longnearly-perfect repeats this question is notoriously difficult andsome copies of such repeats may be “lost” in genomicassemblies. We describe our EULER-CN algorithm for the Copy NumberProblem that proved to be successful in difficult sequencingprojects.Contact:ppevzner@ucsd.edu	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS225%2f262277	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S225/262277/Fragment-assembly-with-double-barreled-data	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S225	NULL	http://ppevzner@ucsd.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Exact exhaustive methods can solvethe problem only for short signals with a limited number ofmutations. In this work, we extend exhaustive enumeration also tolonger patterns. More in detail, the basic version of algorithmpresented in this paper, given as input a set of sequences and anerror ratio ε < 1, finds all patterns that occur in atleastqsequences of the set with at mostεmmutations, wheremis the length of the pattern.The only restriction is imposed on the location of mutations alongthe signal. That is, a valid occurrence of a pattern can present atmost ⌈εi⌉ mismatches in the firstinucleotides, and so on. However, we show how the algorithmcan be used also when no assumption can be made on the position ofmutations. In this case, it is also possible to have an estimate ofthe probability of finding a signal according to the signal length,the error ratio, and the input parameters.

Due to the strongly hydrophobic amino acidcomposition of transmembrane domains, suboptimal results are obtainedwhen general-purpose scoring matrices such as BLOSUM are used.Recently, a transmembrane-specific score matrix called PHAT was shownto perform much better than BLOSUM. In this article, we derive atransmembrane score matrix family, called SLIM, which has severaldistinguishing features. In contrast to currently used matrices, SLIMis non-symmetric. The asymmetry arises because different backgroundcompositions are assumed for the transmembrane query and the unknowndatabase sequences. We describe the mathematical model behind SLIM indetail and show that SLIM outperforms PHAT both on simulated data andin a realistic setting.

Croning	NULL	G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are found in greatnumbers in most eukaryotic genomes. They are responsible for sensinga staggering variety of structurally diverse ligands, with theiractivation resulting in the initiation of a variety of cellularsignalling cascades. The physiological response that is observedfollowing receptor activation is governed by the guaninenucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) to which a particularreceptor chooses to couple. Previous investigations have demonstratedthat the specificity of the receptor-G protein interaction isgoverned by the intracellular domains of the receptor. Despite manystudies it has proven very difficult to predictde novo,from the receptor sequence alone, the G proteins to which a GPCR ismost likely to couple. We have used a data-mining approach, combiningpattern discovery with membrane topology prediction, to find patternsof amino acid residues in the intracellular domains of GPCR sequencesthat are specific for coupling to a particular functional class of Gproteins. A prediction system was then built, being based upon thesediscovered patterns. We can report this approach was successful inthe prediction of G protein coupling specificity of unknownsequences. Such predictions should be of great use in providingin silicocharacterisation of newly cloned receptorsequences and for improving the annotation of GPCRs stored in proteinsequence databases.

These molecular patterns can be revealedroutinely on a genomic scale. However, class prediction based onthese patterns is an under-determined problem, due to the extremehigh dimensionality of the data compared to the usually small numberof available samples. This makes a reduction of the datadimensionality necessary. Here we demonstrate how phenotypic classescan be predicted by combining feature selection and discriminantanalysis.

In the post-genomic viewof cellular function, each biological entity is seen in the contextof a complex network of interactions. Accordingly, we modelfunctional space by representing protein-protein-interaction data asundirected graphs. We suggest a general approach to generateinteraction maps of cellular networks in the presence of hugeamounts of fragmented and incomplete data, and to deriverepresentations of large networks which hide clutter while keepingthe essential architecture of the interaction space. This isachieved by contracting the graphs according to domain-specifichierarchical classifications. The key concept here is the notion ofinduced interaction, which allows the integration, comparison andanalysis of interaction data from different sources and differentorganisms at a given level of abstraction.Results: We apply this approach to compute the overlap betweenthe DIP compendium of interaction data and a dataset of yeasttwo-hybrid experiments. The architecture of this network isscale-free, as frequently seen in biological networks, and thisproperty persists through many levels of abstraction. Connections inthe network can be projected downwards from higher levels ofabstraction down to the level of individual proteins. As an example,we describe an algorithm for fold assignment by network context.This method currently predicts protein folds at 30% accuracy withoutany requirement of detectable sequence similarity of the queryprotein to a protein of known structure. We used this algorithm tocompile a list of structural assignments for previously unassignedgenes from yeast.

One important use of such databases is the ability tosearch for experiments that have similar gene expression levels as aquery, potentially identifying previously unsuspected relationshipsamong cellular states. Such searches depend crucially on the metricused to assess the similarity between pairs of experiments. Thecomplex joint distribution of gene expression levels, particularlytheir correlational structure and non-normality, make simplesimilarity metrics such as Euclidean distance or correlationalsimilarity scores suboptimal for use in this application. We presenta similarity metric for gene expression array experiments that takesinto account the complex joint distribution of expression values. Weprovide a computationally tractable approximation to this measure,and have implemented a database search tool based on it. We discussimplementation issues and efficiency, and we compare our new metricto other standard metrics.Contact:larry.hunter@uchsc.edu	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS115%2f261793	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S115/261793/GEST-a-gene-expression-search-tool-based-on-a	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S115	NULL	http://larry.hunter@uchsc.edu	NULL	NULL

  method for gene expression data"	http://heydebre@molgen.mpg.de	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Anja von Heydebreck,Wolfgang Huber,Annemarie Poustka,Martin Vingron	NULL	We present a new class discovery method for microarray geneexpression data. Based on a collection of gene expression profilesfrom different tissue samples, the method searches for binary classdistinctions in the set of samples that show clear separation in theexpression levels of specific subsets of genes. Several mutuallyindependent class distinctions may be found, which is difficult toobtain from most commonly used clustering algorithms. Each classdistinction can be biologically interpreted in terms of itssupporting genes. The mathematical characterization of the favoredclass distinctions is based on statistical concepts. By analyzingthree data sets from cancer gene expression studies, we demonstratethat our method is able to detect biologically relevant structures,for example cancer subtypes, in an unsupervised fashion.Contact:heydebre@molgen.mpg.de	2001-06-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f17%2fsuppl_1%2fS107%2f261752	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/suppl_1/S107/261752/Identifying-splits-with-clear-separation-a-new	10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S107	NULL	http://heydebre@molgen.mpg.de	NULL	NULL

1123	Codon adaptation index as a measure of dominating codon bias	http://www.ihes.fr/~materials	ORIGINAL PAPERS	230	136	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	A. Carbone,A. Zinovyev,F. Képès	NULL	We propose a simple algorithm to detect dominating synonymous codon usage bias in genomes. The algorithm is based on a precise mathematical formulation of the problem that lead us to use the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) as a ‘universal’ measure of codon bias. This measure has been previously employed in the specific context of translational bias. With the set of coding sequences as a sole source of biological information, the algorithm provides a reference set of genes which is highly representative of the bias. This set can be used to compute the CAI of genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including those whose functional annotation isnotyet available. An important application concerns the detection of a reference set characterizing translational bias which is known to correlate to expression levels; in this case, the algorithm becomes a key tool to predict gene expression levels, to guide regulatory circuit reconstruction, and to compare species. The algorithm detects also leading–lagging strands bias, GC-content bias, GC3 bias, and horizontal gene transfer. The approach is validated on 12 slow-growing and fast-growing bacteria,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Caenorhabditis elegansandDrosophila melanogaster.Availability:http://www.ihes.fr/~materials.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2005/241992/Codon-adaptation-index-as-a-measure-of-dominating	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg272	NULL	http://carbone@ihes.fr,http://www.ihes.fr/~materials	NULL	NULL
1124	A novel strategy for microarray quality control using Bayesian networks	http://sigwww.cs.tut.fi/TICSP/SpotQuality/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	13	36	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Sampsa Hautaniemi,Henrik Edgren,Petri Vesanen,Maija Wolf,Anna-Kaarina Järvinen,Olli Yli-Harja,Jaakko Astola,Olli Kallioniemi,Outi Monni	NULL	Motivation:High-throughput microarray technologies enable measurements of the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel. However, microarray printing, hybridization and washing may create substantial variability in the quality of the data. As erroneous measurements may have a drastic impact on the results by disturbing the normalization schemes and by introducing expression patterns that lead to incorrect conclusions, it is crucial to discard low quality observations in the early phases of a microarray experiment. A typical microarray experiment consists of tens of thousands of spots on a microarray, making manual extraction of poor quality spots impossible. Thus, there is a need for a reliable and general microarray spot quality control strategy.Results:We suggest a novel strategy for spot quality control by using Bayesian networks, which contain many appealing properties in the spot quality control context. We illustrate how a non-linear least squares based Gaussian fitting procedure can be used in order to extract features for a spot on a microarray. The features we used in this study are: spot intensity, size of the spot, roundness of the spot, alignment error, background intensity, background noise, and bleeding. We conclude that Bayesian networks are a reliable and useful model for microarray spot quality assessment.Supplementary information:http://sigwww.cs.tut.fi/TICSP/SpotQuality/	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2031/242096/A-novel-strategy-for-microarray-quality-control	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg275	NULL	http://sampsa.hautaniemi@tut.fi,http://sigwww.cs.tut.fi/TICSP/SpotQuality/	NULL	NULL

1134	An unsupervised hierarchical dynamic self-organizing approach to cancer class discovery and marker gene identification in microarray data	http://www.mame.mu.oz.au/mechatronics/journalinfo/Hsu2003supp.pdf	ORIGINAL PAPERS	25	50	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Arthur L. Hsu,Sen-Lin Tang,Saman K. Halgamuge	NULL	Motivation:Current Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) approaches to gene expression pattern clustering require the user to predefine the number of clusters likely to be expected. Hierarchical clustering methods used in this area do not provide unique partitioning of data. We describe an unsupervised dynamic hierarchical self-organizing approach, which suggests an appropriate number of clusters, to perform class discovery and marker gene identification in microarray data. In the process of class discovery, the proposed algorithm identifies corresponding sets of predictor genes that best distinguish one class from other classes. The approach integrates merits of hierarchical clustering with robustness against noise known from self-organizing approaches.Results:The proposed algorithm applied to DNA microarray data sets of two types of cancers has demonstrated its ability to produce the most suitable number of clusters. Further, the corresponding marker genes identified through the unsupervised algorithm also have a strong biological relationship to the specific cancer class. The algorithm tested on leukemia microarray data, which contains three leukemia types, was able to determine three major and one minor cluster. Prediction models built for the four clusters indicate that the prediction strength for the smaller cluster is generally low, therefore labelled as uncertain cluster. Further analysis shows that the uncertain cluster can be subdivided further, and the subdivisions are related to two of the original clusters. Another test performed using colon cancer microarray data has automatically derived two clusters, which is consistent with the number of classes in data (cancerous and normal).Availability:JAVA software of dynamic SOM tree algorithm is available upon request for academic use.Supplementary information:A comparison of rectangular and hexagonal topologies for GSOM is available fromhttp://www.mame.mu.oz.au/mechatronics/journalinfo/Hsu2003supp.pdf	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2131/242700/An-unsupervised-hierarchical-dynamic-self	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg296	NULL	http://alhs@mame.mu.oz.au,http://www.mame.mu.oz.au/mechatronics/journalinfo/Hsu2003supp.pdf	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL

Linge,Michael Habeck,Wolfgang Rieping,Michael Nilges	NULL	Motivation: In the light of several ongoing structural genomics projects, faster andmore reliable methods for structure calculation from NMR data are in greatdemand. The major bottleneck in the determination of solution NMR structuresis the assignment of NOE peaks (nuclear Overhauser effect).

These networks are often very large andcomplex. To properly understand and analyze the global properties ofmetabolic networks, methods for rationally representing and quantitatively analyzing their structure are needed.Results:In this work, the metabolic networks of 80 fully sequenced organisms arein silicoreconstructed from genome data and an extensively revisedbioreaction database. The networks are represented as directed graphs andanalyzed by using the‘ breadth first searching algorithm to identify theshortest pathway (path length) between any pair of the metabolites. Theaverage path length of the networks are then calculated and compared for allthe organisms. Different from previous studies the connections throughcurrent metabolites and cofactors are deleted to make the path lengthanalysis physiologically more meaningful. The distribution of the connectiondegree of these networks is shown to follow the power law, indicating thatthe overall structure of all the metabolic networks has the characteristicsof a small world network.

Using the information about genes (locus, allele, mutation rate, fitness, etc.), we attempt to explain population demographic data. This population evolution study could complement and enhance biologists’ understanding about genes.Results: We present a general approach to study population genetics in complex situations. In the present approach, multiple allele inheritance, multiple loci inheritance, natural selection and mutations are allowed simultaneously in order to consider a more realistic situation. A simulation program is presented so that readers can readily carry out studies with their own parameters. It is shown that the multiplicity of the loci greatly affects the demographic results of fractional population ratios. Furthermore, the study indicates that some high infant mortality rates due to congenital anomalies can be attributed to multiple loci inheritance.Availability: The simulation program can be downloaded fromhttp://won.hongik.ac.kr/~mhchung/index_files/yapop.htm.In order to run this program, one needs Visual Studio .NET platform, which can be downloaded fromhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/default.asp.Contact:mhchung@hongik.ac.kr*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/256/372713/Fractional-populations-in-multiple-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.256	NULL	http://won.hongik.ac.kr/~mhchung/index_files/yapop.htm,http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/default.asp,http://mhchung@hongik.ac.kr	NULL	NULL

using Gene Ontology"	http://harhay@email.marc.usda.gov	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	16	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Gregory P. Harhay,John W. Keele	NULL	Motivation: The number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in GenBank has now surpassed200 000 for cattle and 100 000 for swine. The Institute of Genome Research(TIGR) has organized these sequences into approximately 60 000 non-redundantconsensus sequences (identified by TIGR Gene Indices) for cattle and 40 000for swine. Anonymous ESTs are of limited value unless they are connected tofunction. Functional information is difficult to manage electronicallybecause of heterogeneity of meaning and form among databases. The GeneOntology (GO) Consortium has produced ontologies for gene function withconsistent meaning and form across species. Linking livestock EST to genefunction through similarity with sequences from other annotation-richmammals could accelerate: (1) the discovery of positional candidate genesunderlying a livestock quantitative trait locus (QTL) and (2) comparativemapping between livestock and other mammals (e.g. humans, mouse and rat). Weinitiated this investigation to determine if incorporation of the GO intothe annotation process could accelerate livestock positional candidate genediscovery.Results: We have associated livestock ESTs with GO nodes through sequencesimilarity to the NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq). Positional candidategenes are identified within minutes that otherwise required days.

Karp,Natalya F. Noy,Russ B. Altman	NULL	Motivation: A critical element of the computational infrastructure required for functional genomics is a shared language for communicating biological data and knowledge. The Gene Ontology (GO;http://www.geneontology.org) provides a taxonomy of concepts and their attributes for annotating gene products. As GO increases in size, its ongoing construction and maintenance becomes more challenging. In this paper, we assess the applicability of a Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS), Protégé-2000, to the maintenance and development of GO.Results: We transferred GO to Protégé-2000 in order to evaluate its suitability for GO. The graphical user interface supported browsing and editing of GO. Tools for consistency checking identified minor inconsistencies in GO and opportunities to reduce redundancy in its representation. The Protégé Axiom Language proved useful for checking ontological consistency. The PROMPT tool allowed us to track changes to GO. Using Protégé-2000, we tested our ability to make changes and extensions to GO to refine the semantics of attributes and classify more concepts.Availability: Gene Ontology in Protégé-2000 and the associated code are located athttp://smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/gokbms/.

However, predicting G-protein coupling based on theamino acid sequence of a receptor has been a daunting task. Whileexperimental data for G-protein coupling exist, published models that relyon sequence based prediction are few. In this study, we have developed aNaive Bayes model to successfully predict G-protein couplingspecificity by training over 80 GPCRs with known coupling. Eachintracellular domain of GPCRs was treated as a discrete random variable,conditionally independent of one another. In order to determine theconditional probability distributions of these variables, ClustalW-generatedphylogenetic trees were used as an approximation for the clustering of theintracellular domain sequences. The sampling of an intracellular domainsequence was achieved by identifying the cluster containing the homologuewith the highest sequence similarity.Results:Out of 55 GPCRs validated, the model yielded a correctclassification rate of 72%. Our model also predicted multiple G-proteincoupling for most of the GPCRs in the validation set.

Homologous sequences have a much lower global similarity if the different regions are much longer than the similar regions.Results: We present a generalized global alignment algorithm for comparing sequences with intermittent similarities, an ordered list of similar regions separated by different regions. A generalized global alignment model is defined tohandle sequences with intermittent similarities. A dynamic programming algorithm is designed to compute an optimal general alignment in time proportional to the product of sequence lengths and in space proportional to the sum of sequence lengths. The algorithm is implemented as a computer program named GAP3 (Global Alignment Program Version 3). The generalized global alignment model is validated by experimental results produced with GAP3 on both DNA and protein sequences.

The differences in evolutionary pattern between functional regions can thus be observed genome-wide in a whole set of organisms. The diverse evolutionary pattern of different functional regions can be exploited in the process of genomic annotation. The modelling of evolution by the existing comparative gene finders leaves room for improvement.Results: A probabilistic model of both genome structure and evolution is designed. This type of model is called an Evolutionary Hidden Markov Model (EHMM), being composed of an HMM and a set of region-specific evolutionary models based on a phylogenetic tree. All parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood, including the phylogenetic tree. It can handle any number of aligned genomes, using their phylogenetic tree to model the evolutionary correlations. The time complexity of all algorithms used for handling the model are linear in alignment length and genome number. The model is applied to the problem of gene finding. The benefit of modelling sequence evolution is demonstrated both in a range of simulations and on a set of orthologous human/mouse gene pairs.Availability: Free availability over the Internet on www server:http://www.birc.dk/Software/evogene.Contact:jsp@daimi.au.dk*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/219/372690/Gene-finding-with-a-hidden-Markov-model-of-genome	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.219	NULL	http://www.birc.dk/Software/evogene,http://jsp@daimi.au.dk	NULL	NULL

features with  gene regulation"	http://nclarke@jhmi.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	5	19	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Neil D. Clarke,Joshua A. Granek	NULL	Motivation: Genome sequences and transcriptome analyses allow the correlation betweengene regulation and DNA sequence features to be studied at the whole-genomelevel. To quantify these correlations, metrics are needed that can beapplied to any sequence feature, regardless of its statistical distribution.It is also desirable for the metric values to be determined objectively,that is, without the use of subjective threshold values.Results: We compare two metrics for quantifying the correlation of DNA sequencefeatures with gene regulation. Each of the metrics is calculated from arank-ordering of genes based on the value of the sequence feature ofinterest. The first metric is the area under the curve for a receiveroperator characteristic plot (ROC AUC), a common way of summarizing thetradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for different values of aprediction criterion. We call the second metric the mean normalizedconditional probability (MNCP). The MNCP can be thought of as the predictivevalue of the sequence feature averaged over all regulated genes. Thestatistical significance (P-value) of each metric can be estimated from simulations. Importantly, theP-value of the MNCP metric is less dramatically affected by the presence of false positives among the set ofco-regulated genes than is the ROC AUC. This is especially useful inanalyzing gene sets identified by DNA microarray analysis because such datacannot distinguish direct regulation by transcription factor binding fromindirect regulation. We demonstrate that these two metrics, taken together,are useful tools for defining the binding site representation and regulatorycontrol regions that best explain the difference between genes that areregulated by a given transcription factor and those that are not.Applications to other gene features are also described.Availability: A Python program for calculating the ROC AUC and MNCP metric values giveninput rank orders is available fromftp://ftp.bs.jhmi.edu/users/nclarke/MNCP/Contact:nclarke@jhmi.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/212/372683/Rank-order-metrics-for-quantifying-the-association	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.212	NULL	http://nclarke@jhmi.edu	NULL	NULL

Oneaspect of this is that current methods of statistical analysis do notadequately utilize the information inherent in the large data sets generatedin a microarray experiment and require a tradeoff between detectionsensitivity and specificity.Results: We present a multistep procedure for analysis of mRNAexpression data obtained from cDNA array methods. To identify and classifydifferentially expressed genes, results from standard pairedt-test ofnormalized data are compared with those from a novel method, denoted anassociative analysis. This method associates experimental gene expressionspresented as residuals in regression analysis against control averagedexpressions to a common standard—the family of similarly computedresiduals for low variability genes derived from control experiments. Byassociating changes in expression of a given gene to a large family ofequally expressed genes of the control group, this method utilizes the largedata sets inherent in microarray experiments to increase both specificityand sensitivity. The overall procedure is illustrated by tabulation of geneswhose expression differs significantly between Snell dwarf mice (dw/dw) andtheir phenotypically normal littermates (dw/+, +/+). Of the 2352 genesexamined only 450–500 were expressed above the background levels observedin nonexpressed genes and of these 120 were established as differentiallyexpressed in dwarf mice at a significance level that excludes appearance offalse positive determinations.Contact:igor-dozmorov@omrf.ouhsc.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/204/372677/An-associative-analysis-of-gene-expression-array	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.204	NULL	http://igor-dozmorov@omrf.ouhsc.edu	NULL	NULL

oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias"	http://www.bioconductor.org,http://bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu,http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html	ORIGINAL PAPER	1310	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	B.M. Bolstad,R.A Irizarry,M. Åstrand,T.P. Speed	NULL	Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons.The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor projecthttp://www.bioconductor.org.Contact:bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu.Supplementary information: Additional figures may be found athttp://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/185/372664/A-comparison-of-normalization-methods-for-high	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.185	NULL	http://www.bioconductor.org,http://bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu,http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html	NULL	NULL
1170	"A study of accuracy and precision in oligonucleotide
arrays: extracting more signal at large concentrations"	http://felix@funes.rockefeller.edu	ORIGINAL PAPER	6	34	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Felix Naef,Nicholas D. Socci,Marcelo Magnasco	NULL	Motivation: Despite the success and popularity of oligonucleotide arrays as a high-throughput technique for measuring mRNA expression levels, quantitative calibration studies have until now been limited. The main reason is that suitable data was not available. However, calibration data recently produced by Affymetrix now permits detailed studies of the intensity dependent sensitivity. Given a certain transcript concentration, it is of particular interest to know whether current analysis methods are capable of detecting differential expression ratios of 2 or higher.Results: Using the calibration data, we demonstrate that while current techniques are capable of detecting changes in the low to mid concentration range, the situation is noticeably worse for high concentrations. In this regime, expression changes as large as 4 fold are severely biased, and changes of 2 are often undetectable. Such effects are mainly the consequence of the sequence specific binding properties of probes, and not the result of optical saturation in the fluorescence measurements. GeneChips are manufactured such that each transcript is probed by a set of sequences with a wide affinity range. We show that this property can be used to design a method capable of reducing the high intensity bias. The idea behind our methods is to transfer the weight of a measurement to a subset of probes with optimal linear response at a given concentration, which can be achieved using local embedding techniques.Availability: Program source code will be sent electronically upon request.Contact:felix@funes.rockefeller.edu*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/178/372659/A-study-of-accuracy-and-precision-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.178	NULL	http://felix@funes.rockefeller.edu	NULL	NULL

Hitzmann	NULL	Motivation: 2D fluorescence spectra provide information from intracellular compounds. Fluorophores like trytophan, tyrosine and phenylalanin as well asNADH and flavins make the corresponding measurement systems very important forbioprocess supervision and control. The evaluation is usually based onchemometric modelling using for their calibration procedure off-linemeasurements of the desired process variables. Due to the data driven approachlots of off-line measurements are required. Here a methodology is presented,which enables to perform a calibration procedure of chemometric models withoutany further measurement.Results:The necessary information for the calibration procedure is provided bymeans of thea prioriknowledge about the process, i.e. a mathematical model,whose model parameters are estimated during the calibration procedure, as wellas the fact that the substrate should be consumed at the end of the process run.The new methodology for chemometric calibration is applied for a batchcultivation of aerobically grownS. cerevisiaeon the glucose Schatzmann medium.As will be presented the chemometric models, which are determined by thismethod, can be used for prediction during new process runs.Availability:The MATHLAB routine is free available on request from the authors.Contact:Hitzmann@IFTC.Uni-Hannover.de*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-01-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000180913600002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/2/173/372652/Chemometric-Modelling-based-on-2D-Fluorescence	10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.173	NULL	http://Hitzmann@IFTC.Uni-Hannover.de	NULL	NULL

Whipple,John J. Collins,Matthias Mann	NULL	Motivation: The complete genomes of a number of organisms have already beensequenced. However, the vast majority of annotated genes are derived by geneprediction methods. It is important to not only validate the predictedcoding regions but also to identify genes that may have been missed by theseprograms.Methods: We searched the entireC.elegansgenomic sequence database maintained by the Sanger Center using human c-Src sequence in a TBLASNsearch. We have confirmed one of the predicted regions by isolation of acDNA and carried out a phylogenetic analysis of Src kinase family members inthe worm, fly and several vertebrate species.Results: Our analysis identified a novel tyrosine kinase in theC.elegansgenome that contains functional features typical of the Src family kinasesthat we have designated as Src-1. The open reading frame contains aconserved N-terminal myristoylation site and a tyrosine residue within theC-terminus that is crucial for regulating the activity of Src kinases.

Bhalla	NULL	Motivation: Analysis of cellular signaling interactions is expectedto pose an enormous informatics challenge, perhaps even larger thananalyzing the genome. The complex networks arising from signaling processesare traditionally represented as block diagrams. A key step in the evolutiontoward a more quantitative understanding of signaling is to explicitlyspecify the kinetics of all chemical reaction steps in a pathway. Technicaladvances in proteomics and high-throughput protein interaction assayspromise a flood of such quantitative data. While annotations, molecularinformation and pathway connectivity have been compiled in severaldatabases, and there are several proposals for general cell modeldescription languages, there is currently little experience with databasesof chemical kinetics and reaction level models of signaling networks.Results: The Database of Quantitative Cellular Signaling is arepository of models of signaling pathways.

D. Yandell	NULL	Motivation: The recent explosion of interest in mining thebiomedical literature for associations between defined entities such asgenes, diseases and drugs has made apparent the need for robust methods ofidentifying occurrences of these entities in biomedical text. Suchconcept-based indexing is strongly dependent on the availability of acomprehensive ontology or lexicon of biomedical terms. However, suchontologies are very difficult and expensive to construct, and often requireextensive manual curation to render them suitable for use by automaticindexing programs. Furthermore, the use of statistically salient nounphrases as surrogates for curated terminology is not without difficulties,due to the lack of high-quality part-of-speech taggers specific to medicalnomenclature.Results: We describe a method of improving the quality ofautomatically extracted noun phrases by employing prior knowledge during theHMM training procedure for the tagger. This enhancement, when combined withappropriate training data, can greatly improve the quality and relevance ofthe extracted phrases, thereby enabling greater accuracy in downstreamliterature mining tasks.Contact:bmajoros@tigr.org*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-02-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181303000012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/3/402/258454/Identification-of-key-concepts-in-biomedical	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg010	NULL	http://bmajoros@tigr.org	NULL	NULL

Moore	NULL	Motivation: Polymorphisms in human genes are being described inremarkable numbers. Determining which polymorphisms and which environmentalfactors are associated with common, complex diseases has become a dauntingtask. This is partly because the effect of any single genetic variation willlikely be dependent on other genetic variations (gene–gene interaction orepistasis) and environmental factors (gene–environment interaction).Detecting and characterizing interactions among multiple factors is both astatistical and a computational challenge. To address this problem, we havedeveloped a multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method for collapsinghigh-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension thus permittinginteractions to be detected in relatively small sample sizes. In this paper,we describe the MDR approach and an MDR software package.Results: We developed a program that integrates MDR with across-validation strategy for estimating the classification and predictionerror of multifactor models. The software can be used to analyzeinteractions among 2–15 genetic and/or environmental factors.

The probabilitythat a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the teststatistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in themeasurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates theproblem. In this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem byadopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order toaddress the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDRcontrolling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution,and compare their performance to that of the naïve application of thelinear step-up procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance isexamined relative to their ease of implementation.Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDRcontrolling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retainsubstantially more power then the family-wise error rate controllingprocedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distributionof each test statistics substantially improves the performance over thenaïve one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a moresophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resamplethe joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDRcontrol.Availability: An R program that adjustsp-values using FDR controlling procedures is freely available over the Internet atwww.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenjaContact:anatr@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-02-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181303000007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/3/368/258230/Identifying-differentially-expressed-genes-using	10.1093/bioinformatics/btf877	NULL	http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenja,http://anatr@post.tau.ac.il	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=11111111	NULL

McDonald	NULL	Motivation: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposonsconstitute a substantial fraction of most eukaryotic genomes and arebelieved to have a significant impact on genome structure and function.Conventional methods used to search for LTR retrotransposons in genomedatabases are labor intensive. We present an efficient, reliable andautomated method to identify and analyze members of this important class oftransposable elements.Results: We have developed a new data-mining program, LTR_STRUC(LTRretrotransposonstructure program) which identifies and automatically analyzesLTR retrotransposons in genome databases by searching for structuralfeatures characteristic of such elements. LTR_STRUC has significantadvantages over conventional search methods in the case of LTRretrotransposon families having low sequence homology to known queries orfamilies with atypical structure (e.g.non-autonomous elements lackingcanonical retroviral ORFs) and is thus a discovery tool that complementsestablished methods. LTR_STRUC finds LTR retrotransposons using analgorithm that encompasses a number of tasks that would otherwise have to beinitiated individually by the user. For each LTR retrotransposon found,LTR_STRUC automatically generates an analysis of a variety of structuralfeatures of biological interest.Availability: The LTR_STRUC program is currently available as aconsole application free of charge to academic users from the authors.	2003-02-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181303000006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/3/362/258249/LTR-STRUC-a-novel-search-and-identification	10.1093/bioinformatics/btf878	NULL	http://gm@uga.edu,http://mcgene@uga.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=11111111	NULL

Maizel, Jr.	NULL	Motivation: Growing evidence demonstrates that local well-ordered structures are closely correlated withcis-acting elements in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The prediction of a well-ordered folding sequence (WFS) in genomic sequences is very helpful in the determination of local RNA elements with structure-dependent functions in mRNAs.Results:In this study, the quality of local WFS is assessed by the energy difference (Ediff) between the free energies of the global minimal structure folded in the segment and its corresponding optimal restrained structure (ORS).The ORS is an optimal structure under the condition in which none of the base-pairs in the global minimal structure is allowed to form.Those WFSs in HIV-1 mRNA, various ferritin mRNAs and genomic sequences containinglet-7RNA gene were searched by a novel method, ed_scan. Our results indicate that the detected WFSs are coincident with known Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA, iron-responsive elements in ferritin mRNAs and smalllet-7 RNAs inCaenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis briggsaeandDrosophila melanogastergenomic sequences. Statistical significance of the WFS is addressed by a quantitative measureZscrethat is az-score ofEdiffand extensive random simulations. We suggest that WFSs with high statistical significance have structural roles involving their sequence information.Availability: The source code of ed_scan is available via anonymous ftp asftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/users/shuyun/scan/ed_scan.tar.Contact:shuyun@orleans.ncifcrf.gov*To whom correspondenceshould be addressed.	2003-02-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000181303000005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/3/354/257980/Discovering-well-ordered-folding-patterns-in	10.1093/bioinformatics/btf826	NULL	http://shuyun@orleans.ncifcrf.gov	NULL	NULL

We present here improvements to the method we introduced previously: the ‘hybrid protein model’ (de Brevern and Hazout,Theor. Chem.

Every local fold is learned by looking for the most similar pattern present in the hybrid protein and modifying it slightly. Finally each position corresponds to a cluster of similar 3D local folds.Results: In this paper, we describe improvements to our method for building an optimal hybrid protein: (i) ‘baby training,’ which is defined as the introduction of large structure fragments and the progressive reduction in the size of training fragments; and (ii) the deletion of the redundant parts of the hybrid protein.

Alexandre	NULL	Motivation: As more and more whole genomes are available, there is a need for new methods to compare large sequences and transfer biological knowledge from annotated genomes to related new ones. BLAST is not suitable to compare multimegabase DNA sequences. MegaBLAST is designed to compare closely related large sequences. Some tools to detect repeats in large sequences have already been developed such as MUMmer or REPuter. They also have time or space restrictions. Moreover, in terms of applications, REPuter only computes repeats and MUMmer works better with related genomes.Results: We present a heuristic method, named FORRepeats, which is based on a novel data structure called factor oracle. In the first step it detects exact repeats in large sequences. Then, in the second step, it computes approximate repeats and performs pairwise comparison. We compared its computational characteristics with BLAST and REPuter. Results demonstrate that it is fast and space economical.

T-cell recognition was long considered exquisitely specific. Recent data also indicate that it is highly flexible, and one receptor may recognize thousands of different peptides. Deciphering the patterns of peptides that elicit a MHC restricted T-cell response is critical for vaccine development.Results:For the first time we develop a support vector machine (SVM) for T-cell epitope prediction with an MHC type I restricted T-cell clone.

Exact recognition of TISs in eukaryotic genes is one of the most important tasks in gene-finding algorithms. However, the task has not been satisfactorily fulfilled up to the present. Here, we propose a cooperatively scanning model for recognizing TISs and the first exons of eukaryotic genes on the basis of the structural characteristics of multi-exon genes.Results:The model was employed to cooperatively scan the TISs and 3′ splicing sites in eukaryotic genes, and the TISs and the first exons of 132 mammalian gene sequences are identified to evaluate the model. Accuracy of exactly recognizing the TISs and the first exons has been found to amount respectively to 64.4 and 51.5%. We believe that the model will be a useful tool for genome annotation and that it can be easily incorporated into other algorithms to achieve higher accuracy in recognizing TISs and the first exons.Availability:The program is available upon request.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000015&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1972/231092/Recognizing-translation-initiation-sites-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg261	NULL	http://yhwangwz@263.net	NULL	NULL

1205	Background rareness-based iterative multiple sequence alignment algorithm for regulatory element detection	http://compbio.ornl.gov/mira/index.html	ORIGINAL PAPERS	2	10	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Chandrasegaran Narasimhan,Philip LoCascio,Edward Uberbacher	NULL	Motivation:Experimental methods capable of generating sets of co-regulated genes have become commonplace, however, recognizing the regulatory motifs responsible for this regulation remains difficult. As a result, computational detection of transcription factor binding sites in such data sets has been an active area of research. Most approaches have utilized either Gibbs sampling or greedy strategies to identify such elements in sets of sequences. These existing methods have varying degrees of success depending on the strength and length of the signals and the number of available sequences. We present a new deterministic iterative algorithm for regulatory element detection based on a Markov chain background. As in other methods, sequences in the entire genome and the training set are taken into account in order to discriminate against commonly occurring signals and produce patterns, which are significant in the training set.Results:The results of the algorithm compare favorably with existing tools on previously known and newly compiled data sets. The iteration based search appears rather rigorous, not only finding the binding sites, but also showing how the binding site stands out from genomic background. The approach used to score the results is critical and a discussion of various scoring schemes and options is also presented. Benchmarking of several methods shows that while most tools are good at detecting strong signals, Gibbs sampling algorithms give inconsistent results when the regulatory element signal becomes weak. A Markov chain based background model alleviates the drawbacks of MAP (maximum a posteriori log likelihood) scores.Availability:Available on request from the authors.Supplementary information:Data and the results presented in this paper are available on the web athttp://compbio.ornl.gov/mira/index.html	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1952/231221/Background-rareness-based-iterative-multiple	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg266	NULL	http://uberbacherec@ornl.gov,http://compbio.ornl.gov/mira/index.html	NULL	NULL

Lee	NULL	Motivation:In microarray studies gene discovery based on fold-change values is often misleading because error variability for each gene is heterogeneous under different biological conditions and intensity ranges. Several statistical testing methods for differential gene expression have been suggested, but some of these approaches are underpowered and result in high false positive rates because within-gene variance estimates are based on a small number of replicated arrays.Results:We propose to use local-pooled-error (LPE) estimates and robust statistical tests for evaluating significance of each gene's differential expression. Our LPE estimation is based on pooling errors within genes and between replicate arrays for genes in which expression values are similar. We have applied our LPE method to compare gene expression in naïve and activated CD8+T-cells. Our results show that the LPE method effectively identifies significant differential-expression patterns with a small number of replicated arrays.Availability:The methodology is implemented with S-PLUS and R functions available athttp://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/bioinformatics	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1945/231161/Local-pooled-error-test-for-identifying	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg264	NULL	http://nj7w@virginia.edu,http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/bioinformatics	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL
1207	Modes and clustering for time-warped gene expression profile data	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	11	23	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Xueli Liu,Hans-Georg Müller	NULL	Motivation:The study of the dynamics of regulatory processes has led to increased interest for the analysis of temporal gene expression level data. To address the dynamics of regulation, expression data are collected repeatedly over time. It is difficult to statistically represent the resulting high-dimensional data. When regulatory processes determine gene expression, time-warping is likely to be present, i.e. the sample of gene expression trajectories reflects variation not only in terms of the expression amplitudes, but also in terms of the temporal structure of gene expression.Results:A non-parametric time-synchronized iterative mean updating technique is proposed to find an overall representation that corresponds to a mode of a sample of expression profiles, viewed as a random sample in function space. The proposed algorithm explores the application of previous work of Hall and Heckman to genome-wide expression data and provides an extension that includes random time-warping with the aim to synchronize timescales across genes. The proposed algorithm is universally applicable for the construction of modes for functional data with time-warping. We demonstrate the construction of mode functions for a sample ofDrosophilagene expression data. The algorithm can be applied to define clusters among the observed trajectories of gene expression, without any kind of prior non-time-warped clustering, as illustrated in the numerical example.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1937/231061/Modes-and-clustering-for-time-warped-gene	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg257	NULL	http://mueller@wald.ucdavis.edu	NULL	NULL

1209	Automatic discovery and classification of bioinformatics Web sources	NULL	ATLANTA CONFERENCE PAPERS	1	11	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Daniel Rocco,Terence Critchlow	NULL	Motivation:The World Wide Web provides an incredible resource to genomics researchers in the form of query access to distributed data sources—e.g. BLAST sequence homology search interfaces. The number of these autonomous sources and their rate of change outpaces the speed at which they can be manually classified, meaning that the available data is not being utilized to its full potential. Manually maintaining a wrapper library will not scale to accommodate the growth of genomics data sources on the Web, challenging us to produce an automated system that can find, classify and wrap new sources without constant human intervention. Previous research has not addressed the problem of automatically locating, classifying and integrating classes of bioinformatics data sources.Results:This paper presents an overview of a system for finding classes of bioinformatics data sources and integrating them behind a unified interface. We describe our approach for automatic classification of new Web sources into relevance categories that eliminates the human effort required to maintain a current repository of sources. Our approach is based on a meta-data description of classes of interesting sources that describes the important features of an entire class of services without tying that description to any particular Web source. We examine the features of this format in the context of BLAST sources to show how it relates to Web sources that are being described. We then show how a description can be used to determine if an arbitrary Web source is an instance of the described service. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we have constructed a prototype that correctly classifies approximately two-thirds of the BLAST sources we tested. We conclude with a discussion of these results, the factors that affect correct automatic classification and areas for future study.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1927/231498/Automatic-discovery-and-classification-of	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg353	NULL	http://rockdj@cc.gatech.edu	NULL	NULL
1210	Prediction of regulatory networks: genome-wide identification of transcription factor targets from gene expression data	http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip	ATLANTA CONFERENCE PAPERS	42	81	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Jiang Qian,Jimmy Lin,Nicholas M. Luscombe,Haiyuan Yu,Mark Gerstein	NULL	Motivation:Defining regulatory networks, linking transcription factors (TFs) to their targets, is a central problem in post-genomic biology. One might imagine one could readily determine these networks through inspection of gene expression data. However, the relationship between the expression timecourse of a transcription factor and its target is not obvious (e.g. simple correlation over the timecourse), and current analysis methods, such as hierarchical clustering, have not been very successful in deciphering them.Results:Here we introduce an approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the targets of a transcription factor by identifying subtle relationships between their expression profiles. In particular, we used SVMs to predict the regulatory targets for 36 transcription factors in theSaccharomyces cerevisiaegenome based on the microarray expression data from many different physiological conditions. We trained and tested our SVM on a data set constructed to include a significant number of both positive and negative examples, directly addressing data imbalance issues. This was non-trivial given that most of the known experimental information is only for positives. Overall, we found that 63% of our TF–target relationships were confirmed through cross-validation. We further assessed the performance of our regulatory network identifications by comparing them with the results from two recent genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments. Overall, we find the agreement between our results and these experiments is comparable to the agreement (albeit low) between the two experiments. We find that this network has a delocalized structure with respect to chromosomal positioning, with a given transcription factor having targets spread fairly uniformly across the genome.Availability:The overall network of the relationships is available on the web athttp://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1917/231387/Prediction-of-regulatory-networks-genome-wide	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg347	NULL	http://Mark.Gerstein@yale.edu,http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip	NULL	NULL

Lukashev,Rainer Fuchs	NULL	Motivation:Interpretation of high-throughput gene expression profiling requires a knowledge of the design principles underlying the networks that sustain cellular machinery. Recently a novel approach based on the study of network topologies has been proposed. This methodology has proven to be useful for the analysis of a variety of biological systems, including metabolic networks, networks of protein–protein interactions, and gene networks that can be derived from gene expression data. In the present paper, we focus on several important issues related to the topology of gene expression networks that have not yet been fully studied.Results:The networks derived from gene expression profiles for both time series experiments in yeast and perturbation experiments in cell lines are studied. We demonstrate that independent from the experimental organism (yeast versus cell lines) and the type of experiment (time courses versus perturbations) the extracted networks have similar topological characteristics suggesting together with the results of other common principles of the structural organization of biological networks. A novel computational model of network growth that reproduces the basic design principles of the observed networks is presented. Advantage of the model is that it provides a general mechanism to generate networks with different types of topology by a variation of a few parameters. We investigate the robustness of the network structure to random damages and to deliberate removal of the most important parts of the system and show a surprising tolerance of gene expression networks to both kinds of disturbance.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1909/231305/Topology-of-gene-expression-networks-as-revealed	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg333	NULL	http://alex_lukashin@biogen.com	NULL	NULL

The biochemical purification of protein complexes followed by identification of components by mass spectrometry is currently the method, which delivers the most reliable information—albeit that the data sets are still difficult to interpret.Consolidating individual experiments into protein complexes, especially for high-throughput screens, is complicated by many contaminants, the occurrence of proteins in otherwise dissimilar purifications due to functional re-use and technical limitations in the detection. A non-redundant collection of protein complexes from experimental data would be useful for biological interpretation, but manual assembly is tedious and often inconsistent.Results:Here, we introduce a measure to define similarity within collections of purifications and generate a set of minimally redundant, comprehensive complexes using unsupervised clustering.Availability:Programs and results are freely available fromhttp://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/Docu/purclust/	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1901/231339/A-comprehensive-set-of-protein-complexes-in-yeast	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg344	NULL	http://roland.krause@cellzome.com,http://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/Docu/purclust/	NULL	NULL

Wolf,Eugene V. Koonin	NULL	Motivation:The distributions of many genome-associated quantities, including the membership of paralogous gene families can be approximated with power laws. We are interested in developing mathematical models of genome evolution that adequately account for the shape of these distributions and describe the evolutionary dynamics of their formation.Results:We show that simple stochastic models of genome evolution lead to power-law asymptotics of protein domain family size distribution. These models, called Birth, Death and Innovation Models (BDIM), represent a special class of balanced birth-and-death processes, in which domain duplication and deletion rates are asymptotically equal up to the second order. The simplest, linear BDIM shows an excellent fit to the observed distributions of domain family size in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. However, the stochastic version of the linear BDIM explored here predicts that the actual size of large paralogous families is reached on an unrealistically long timescale. We show that introduction of non-linearity, which might be interpreted as interaction of a particular order between individual family members, allows the model to achieve genome evolution rates that are much better compatible with the current estimates of the rates of individual duplication/loss events.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1889/231430/Simple-stochastic-birth-and-death-models-of-genome	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg351	NULL	http://koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov	NULL	NULL

The algorithm (1) first finds a layout of connected components of an entire network, (2) finds a global layout of nodes with respect to pivot nodes within a connected component and (3) refines the local layout of each connected component by first relocating midnodes with respect to their cutvertices and direct neighbors of the cutvertices and then by relocating all nodes with respect to their neighbors within distance 2. Advantages of this algorithm over classical graph drawing methods include: (1) it is an order of magnitude faster, (2) it can directly visualize data from protein interaction databases and (3) it provides several abstraction and comparison operations for effectively analyzing large-scale protein interaction networks.Availability:http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/interviewer/	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1882/231359/A-fast-layout-algorithm-for-protein-interaction	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg346	NULL	http://khan@inha.ac.kr,http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/interviewer/	NULL	NULL
1215	Learning to predict protein–protein interactions from protein sequences	NULL	ATLANTA CONFERENCE PAPERS	70	103	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Shawn M. Gomez,William Stafford Noble,Andrey Rzhetsky	NULL	In order to understand the molecular machinery of the cell, we need to know about the multitude of protein–protein interactions that allow the cell to function. High-throughput technologies provide some data about these interactions, but so far that data is fairly noisy. Therefore, computational techniques for predicting protein–protein interactions could be of significant value. One approach to predicting interactionsin silicois to produce from first principles a detailed model of a candidate interaction. We take an alternative approach, employing a relatively simple model that learns dynamically from a large collection of data. In this work, we describe anattraction–repulsionmodel, in which the interaction between a pair of proteins is represented as the sum of attractive and repulsive forces associated with small, domain- or motif-sized features along the length of each protein. The model is discriminative, learning simultaneously from known interactions and from pairs of proteins that are known (or suspected) not to interact. The model is efficient to compute and scales well to very large collections of data. In a cross-validated comparison using known yeast interactions, the attraction–repulsion method performs better than several competing techniques.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1875/231466/Learning-to-predict-protein-protein-interactions	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg352	NULL	http://sgomez@pasteur.fr	NULL	NULL
1216	Greedily building protein networks with confidence	NULL	ATLANTA CONFERENCE PAPERS	7	36	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Joel S. Bader	NULL	Motivation:With genome sequences complete for human and model organisms, it is essential to understand how individual genes and proteins are organized into biological networks. Much of the organization is revealed by proteomics experiments that now generate torrents of data. Extracting relevant complexes and pathways from high-throughput proteomics data sets has posed a challenge, however, and new methods to identify and extract networks are essential. We focus on the problem of building pathways starting from known proteins of interest.Results:We have developed an efficient, greedy algorithm, SEEDY, that extracts biologically relevant biological networks from protein–protein interaction data, building out from selected seed proteins. The algorithm relies on our previous study establishing statistical confidence levels for interactions generated by two-hybrid screens and inferred from mass spectrometric identification of protein complexes. We demonstrate the ability to extract known yeast complexes from high-throughput protein interaction data with a tunable parameter that governs the trade-off between sensitivity and selectivity. DNA damage repair pathways are presented as a detailed example. We highlight the ability to join heterogeneous data sets, in this case protein–protein interactions and genetic interactions, and the appearance of cross-talk between pathways caused by re-use of shared components.Significance and comparison:The significance of the SEEDY algorithm is that it is fast, running time O[(E+V) logV] forVproteins andEinteractions, a single adjustable parameter controls the size of the pathways that are generated, and an associatedP-value indicates the statistical confidence that the pathways are enriched for proteins with a coherent function. Previous approaches have focused on extracting sub-networks by identifying motifs enriched in known biological networks. SEEDY provides the complementary ability to perform a directed search based on proteins of interest.Availability:SEEDY software (Perl source), data tables and confidence score models (R source) are freely available from the author.	2003-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186179000002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/15/1869/231530/Greedily-building-protein-networks-with-confidence	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg358	NULL	http://jbader@bme.jhu.edu	NULL	NULL

Using an improved Voronoi procedure, we calculate reference packing densities for different regions in the protein interior. Furthermore, we want to clarify where cavities are located.Results:Sets of reference packing densities are provided for regions in proteins that differ in their distance to the surface and to internal cavities, supplementing previous data. Packing in the protein interior is tight but generally inhomogeneous. There are about 4.4 cavities per 100 amino acids in protein structures, they occur in all regions, most frequently in a depth of 2.5–3.6 Å underneath the Connolly surface. However, the deepest protein regions have a lower mean packing density than circumjacent regions, because more contacts to cavities occur in the core.Availability/Supplementary information:Calculation software and detailed packing data are available on request.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2112/242595/Inhomogeneous-molecular-density-reference-packing	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg292	NULL	http://cornelius.froemmel@charite.de	NULL	NULL

Sanchez-Villeda,M. Polacco,M. McMullen,S. Schroeder,J. Gardiner,G. Davis,S. Havermann,Y. Yim,I. Vroh Bi,E. Coe	NULL	Motivation:Because of the unique biological features, a bioinformatic platform for the integrated genetic and physical map of maize is required for storing, integrating, accessing and visualizing the underlying data.Results:The goal of the Maize Mapping Project is to develop a fully integrated genetic and physical map for maize. To display this integrated map, we have developed iMap. iMap has three main components: a relational database (iMapDB), a map graphic browser (iMap Viewer) and a search utility (iMap Search). iMapDB is populated with current genetic and physical map data, describing relationships among genetic loci, molecular markers and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs. The database also contains integrated information produced by applying a set of anchoring rules to assign BAC contigs to specific locations on the genetic map. The iMap Viewer and iMap Search functions are combined in the user interface to allow viewing and retrieving many types of genetic and physical map data. The iMap Viewer features side-by-side chromosome-based displays of the genetic map and associated BAC contigs. For each genetic locus, information about marker type or contig can be viewed via pop-up windows that feature links to external data resources. Searches can be conducted for genetic locus, probe or sequence accession number; search results include relevant map positions, anchored BAC contigs and links to the graphical display of relevant chromosomes. iMap can be accessed athttp://www.maizemap.orgAvailability:The iMap utility package is available for non-commercial use upon request from the authors.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900013&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2105/242511/iMap-a-database-driven-utility-to-integrate-and	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg289	NULL	http://fangz@missouri.edu,http://www.maizemap.org	NULL	NULL

Lewis,William Stafford Noble	NULL	Motivation:Unsupervised analysis of microarray gene expression data attempts to find biologically significant patterns within a given collection of expression measurements. For example, hierarchical clustering can be applied to expression profiles of genes across multiple experiments, identifying groups of genes that share similiar expression profiles. Previous work using the support vector machine supervised learning algorithm with microarray data suggests that higher-order features, such as pairwise and tertiary correlations across multiple experiments, may provide significant benefit in learning to recognize classes of co-expressed genes.Results:We describe a generalization of the hierarchical clustering algorithm that efficiently incorporates these higher-order features by using a kernel function to map the data into a high-dimensional feature space. We then evaluate the utility of the kernel hierarchical clustering algorithm using both internal and external validation. The experiments demonstrate that the kernel representation itself is insufficient to provide improved clustering performance. We conclude that mapping gene expression data into a high-dimensional feature space is only a good idea when combined with a learning algorithm, such as the support vector machine that does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.Availability:Supplementary data atwww.cs.columbia.edu/compbio/hiclust.

1222	A Bayesian missing value estimation method for gene expression profile data	http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/~shige-o/tools/	ORIGINAL PAPERS	234	263	3	Bioinformatics Oxford	Shigeyuki Oba,Masa-aki Sato,Ichiro Takemasa,Morito Monden,Ken-ichi Matsubara,Shin Ishii	NULL	Motivation:Gene expression profile analyses have been used in numerous studies covering a broad range of areas in biology. When unreliable measurements are excluded, missing values are introduced in gene expression profiles. Although existing multivariate analysis methods have difficulty with the treatment of missing values, this problem has received little attention. There are many options for dealing with missing values, each of which reaches drastically different results. Ignoring missing values is the simplest method and is frequently applied. This approach, however, has its flaws. In this article, we propose an estimation method for missing values, which is based on Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA). Although the methodology that a probabilistic model and latent variables are estimated simultaneously within the framework of Bayes inference is not new in principle, actual BPCA implementation that makes it possible to estimate arbitrary missing variables is new in terms of statistical methodology.Results:When applied to DNA microarray data from various experimental conditions, the BPCA method exhibited markedly better estimation ability than other recently proposed methods, such as singular value decomposition andK-nearest neighbors. While the estimation performance of existing methods depends on model parameters whose determination is difficult, our BPCA method is free from this difficulty. Accordingly, the BPCA method provides accurate and convenient estimation for missing values.Availability:The software is available athttp://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/~shige-o/tools/	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900011&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2088/242445/A-Bayesian-missing-value-estimation-method-for	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg287	NULL	http://ishii@is.aist-nara.ac.jp,http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/~shige-o/tools/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=dddddddd	NULL

A picture of footprints after the interaction of the HIV-1 Ψ-RNA packaging region with drugs	http://humbertogd@cbq.uclv.edu.cu,http://humbertogd@navegalia.com	ORIGINAL PAPERS	1	0	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	Humberto González Díaz,Ronal Ramos de Armas,Reinaldo Molina	NULL	Motivation:Many experts worldwide have highlighted the potential of RNA molecules as drug targets for the chemotherapeutic treatment of a range of diseases. In particular, the molecular pockets of RNA in the HIV-1 packaging region have been postulated as promising sites for antiviral action. The discovery of simpler methods to accurately represent drug–RNA interactions could therefore become an interesting and rapid way to generate models that are complementary to docking-based systems.Results:The entropies of a vibrational Markov chain have been introduced here as physically meaningful descriptors for the local drug–nucleic acid complexes. A study of the interaction of the antibiotic Paromomycin with the packaging region of the RNA present in type-1 HIV has been carried out as an illustrative example of this approach. A linear discriminant function gave rise to excellent discrimination among 80.13% of interacting/non-interacting sites. More specifically, the model classified 36/45 nucleotides (80.0%) that interacted with paromomycin and, in addition, 85/106 (80.2%) footprinted (non-interacting) sites from the RNA viral sequence were recognized. The model showed a high Matthews’ regression coefficient (C = 0.64). The Jackknife method was also used to assess the stability and predictability of the model by leaving out adenines, C, G, or U. Matthews’ coefficients and overall accuracies for these approaches were between 0.55 and 0.68 and 75.8 and 82.7, respectively. On the other hand, a linear regression model predicted the local binding affinity constants between a specific nucleotide and the aforementioned antibiotic (R2= 0.83,Q2= 0.825). These kinds of models may play an important role either in the discovery of new anti-HIV compounds or in the elucidation of their mode of action.Availability:On request from the corresponding author (humbertogd@cbq.uclv.edu.cuorhumbertogd@navegalia.com)	2003-11-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fbioinformatics%2farticle%2f19%2f16%2f2079%2f242417	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2079/242417/Markovian-negentropies-in-bioinformatics-1-A	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg285	NULL	http://humbertogd@vodafone.es,http://humbertogd@cbq.uclv.edu.cu,http://humbertogd@navegalia.com	NULL	NULL

Due to some special features of gene expression data, several new methods have been proposed, including the weighted voting scheme of Golubet al., the compound covariate method of Hedenfalket al. (originally proposed by Tukey), and the shrunken centroids method of Tibshiraniet al. These methods look different and are more or lessad hoc.Results:We point out a close connection of the three methods with a linear regression model. Casting the classification problem in the general framework of linear regression naturally leads to new alternatives, such as partial least squares (PLS) methods and penalized PLS (PPLS) methods. Using two real data sets, we show the competitive performance of our new methods when compared with the other three methods.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900009&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2072/242357/Linear-regression-and-two-class-classification	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg283	NULL	http://weip@biostat.umn.edu	NULL	NULL

Dorssers,Guido Jenster	NULL	Motivation:To evaluate microarray data, clustering is widely used to group biological samples or genes. However, problems arise when comparing heterologous databases. As the clustering algorithm searches for similarities between experiments, it will most likely first separate the data sets, masking relationships that exist between samples from different databases.Results:We developed a program, Venn Mapper, to calculate the statistical significance of the number of co-occurring differentially expressed genes in any of the two experiments. For proof of principle, we analysed a heterologous data set of 170 microarrays including breast and prostate cancer microarray analyses. Significant overlap was found in an unsupervised analysis between metastasized prostate cancer and metastasized breast cancer and BRCA mutated breast cancer. A comparison between single microarray data and the averaged breast and prostate data sets was also evaluated. This analysis suggests that genes expressed higher in stromal cells are also implicated in metastatic prostate cancer and BRCA mutated breast cancer. The Venn Mapper program identifies overlaps between samples from heterologous data sets and directly extracts the genes responsible for the overlap. From this information novel biological hypotheses may be addressed.Availability:Venn Mapper is freely available onhttp://www.erasmusmc.nl/gatcplatformSupplementary information:http://www.erasmusmc.nl/gatcplatform/vennmapper.html	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2065/242310/Venn-Mapping-clustering-of-heterologous-microarray	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg282	NULL	http://g.jenster@erasmusmc.nl,http://www.erasmusmc.nl/gatcplatform,http://www.erasmusmc.nl/gatcplatform/vennmapper.html	NULL	NULL
1226	Protein structural class identification directly from NMR spectra using averaged chemical shifts*	NULL	ORIGINAL PAPERS	5	20	0	Bioinformatics Oxford	S.P. Mielke,V.V. Krishnan	NULL	Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of proteins is integral to understanding their functions, and a necessity in the era of proteomics. A wide range of computational methods is employed to estimate the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of proteins. Comprehensive experimental methods, on the other hand, are limited to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. The full characterization of individual structures, using either of these techniques, is extremely time intensive. The demands of high throughput proteomics necessitate the development of new, faster experimental methods for providing structural information. As a first step toward such a method, we explore the possibility of determining the structural classes of proteins directly from their NMR spectra, prior to resonance assignment, using averaged chemical shifts. This is achieved by correlating NMR-based information with empirical structure-based information available in widely used electronic databases. The results are analyzed statistically for their significance. The robustness of the method as a structure predictor is probed by applying it to a set of proteins of unknown structure. Our results show that this NMR-based method can be used as a low-resolution tool for protein structural class identification.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900007&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2054/242243/Protein-structural-class-identification-directly	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg280	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Gilder	NULL	Motivation:As research into disease pathology and cellular function continues to generate vast amounts of data pertaining to protein, gene and small molecule (PGSM) interactions, there exists a critical need to capture these results in structured formats allowing for computational analysis. Although many efforts have been made to create databases that store this information in computer readable form, populating these sources largely requires a manual process of interpreting and extracting interaction relationships from the biological research literature. Being able to efficiently and accurately automate the extraction of interactions from unstructured text, would greatly improve the content of these databases and provide a method for managing the continued growth of new literature being published.Results:In this paper, we describe a system for extracting PGSM interactions from unstructured text. By utilizing a lexical analyzer and context free grammar (CFG), we demonstrate that efficient parsers can be constructed for extracting these relationships from natural language with high rates of recall and precision. Our results show that this technique achieved a recall rate of 83.5% and a precision rate of 93.1% for recognizing PGSM names and a recall rate of 63.9% and a precision rate of 70.2% for extracting interactions between these entities. In contrast to other published techniques, the use of a CFG significantly reduces the complexities of natural language processing by focusing on domain specific structure as opposed to analyzing the semantics of a given language. Additionally, our approach provides a level of abstraction for adding new rules for extracting other types of biological relationships beyond PGSM relationships.Availability:The program and corpus are available by request from the authors.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900006&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2046/242199/Extraction-of-protein-interaction-information-from	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg279	NULL	http://gilder@research.ge.com,http://jtemkin1@comcast.net	NULL	NULL

We developed and tested an algorithm that finds optimal matches between two families of proteins by comparing their distance matrices. A distance matrix provides a measure of the sequence similarity of proteins within a family. Since the protein sets of interest may have dozens of proteins each, the use of an efficient approximate solution is necessary. Therefore the approach we have developed consists of aMetropolis Monte Carlooptimization algorithm which explores the search space of possible matches between two distance matrices. We demonstrate that by using this algorithm we are able to accurately match chemokines and chemokine-receptors as well as the tgfβ family of ligands and their receptors.	2003-11-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000186448900005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/16/2039/242166/Inferring-protein-interactions-from-phylogenetic	10.1093/bioinformatics/btg278	NULL	http://matteope@proteinpathways.com	NULL	NULL
