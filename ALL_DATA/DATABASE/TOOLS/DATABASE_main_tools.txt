At well over 27 000 terms, the descriptiveness of GO has increased rapidly in line with the biological data it represents. Therefore, it is vital to be able to easily and quickly mine the functional information that has been made available through these GO terms being associated with gene products. QuickGO is a fast, web-based tool for browsing the GO and all associated GO annotations provided by the GOA group. After undergoing a redevelopment, QuickGO is now able to offer many more features beyond simple browsing. Users have responded well to the new tool and given very positive feedback about its usefulness. This tutorial will demonstrate how some of these features could be useful to the researcher wanting to discover more about their dataset, particular areas of biology or to find new ways of directing their research.Database URL:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO	0.0	4	1	258	293	252	256	0.263237475901	0.20328830638	0.122651068542	0.110166578702	1.84030330076	-0.0896102113225	-0.942320682667	NULL	5.78741169395	-3.19082188455

This can be facilitated by putting accessible and automated approaches analysing the current wealth of ‘omic’-scale data in the hands of researchers who are directly addressing biological questions. Data integration techniques and standardized, automated, high-throughput analyses are needed to manage the data available as well as to help narrow down the excessive number of target gene possibilities presented by modern databases and system-level resources. Here we present CancerMA, an online, integrated bioinformatic pipeline for automated identification of novel candidate cancer markers/targets; it operates by means of meta-analysing expression profiles of user-defined sets of biologically significant and related genes across a manually curated database of 80 publicly available cancer microarray datasets covering 13 cancer types. A simple-to-use web interface allows bioinformaticians and non-bioinformaticians alike to initiate new analyses as well as to view and retrieve the meta-analysis results. The functionality of CancerMA is shown by means of two validation datasets.Database URL:http://www.cancerma.org.uk	1.0	4	2	105	147	244	76	0.248406601966	0.242710496269	0.161916413357	0.149350896759	0.937286571422	4.26473749001	0.807076405278	NULL	4.43372958673	-0.665017941902

Single-target drugs may not always produce desired physiological effects on the entire biological system, even if they have successfully regulated the activities of their designated targets. On the other hand, multicomponent therapy, in which two or more agents simultaneously interact with multiple targets, has attracted growing attention. Many drug combinations consisting of multiple agents have already entered clinical practice, especially in treating complex and refractory diseases. Drug combination database (DCDB), launched in 2010, is the first available database that collects and organizes information on drug combinations, with an aim to facilitate systems-oriented new drug discovery. Here, we report the second major release of DCDB (Version 2.0), which includes 866 new drug combinations (1363 in total), consisting of 904 distinctive components. These drug combinations are curated from ∼140 000 clinical studies and the food and drug administration (FDA) electronic orange book.

Towards that end, he or she will search a variety of public and propriety databases for information linking that protein to the observed AE. However, these databases tend to present all available information about a protein, which can be overwhelming, limiting the ability to find information about the specific toxicity being investigated. ToxReporter compiles information from a broad selection of resources and limits display of the information to user-selected areas of interest. ToxReporter is a PERL-based web-application which utilizes a MySQL database to streamline this process by categorizing public and proprietary domain-derived information into predefined safety categories according to a customizable lexicon. Users can view gene information that is ‘red-flagged’ according to the safety issue under investigation. ToxReporter also uses a scoring system based on relative counts of the red-flags to rank all genes for the amount of information pertaining to each safety issue and to display their scored ranking as an easily interpretable ‘Tox-At-A-Glance’ chart. Although ToxReporter was originally developed to display safety information, its flexible design could easily be adapted to display disease information as well.Database URL:ToxReporter is freely available athttps://github.com/mgosink/ToxReporter.	0.0	6	5	254	179	84	3	0.0934902795538	0.0882240032203	0.0761618019306	0.0713343476908	5.39664347394	3.01920028385	6.00032296899	NULL	3.95166220192	-12.71265614

Next-generation sequencing technology has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume of genomic data for pigs. However, the limited amount of variation data provided by dbSNP, and non-congruent criteria used for calling variation, present considerable hindrances to the utility of this data. We used a uniform pipeline, based on GATK, to identify non-redundant, high-quality, whole-genome SNPs from 280 pigs and 6 outgroup species. A total of 64.6 million SNPs were identified in 280 pigs and 36.8 million in the outgroups. We then used LUMPY to identify a total of 7 236 813 structural variations (SVs) in 211 pigs. Positively selected loci were identified through five statistical tests of different evolutionary attributes of the SNPs. Combining the non-redundant variations and the evolutionary selective scores, we built the first pig-specific variation database, PigVar (http://www.ibiomedical.net/pigvar/), which is a web-based open-access resource. PigVar collects parameters of the variations including summary lists of the locations of the variations within protein-coding and long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, whether the SNPs are synonymous or non-synonymous, their ancestral and derived states, geographic sampling locations, as well as breed information.

Although its genome sequence was originally published in 2007, the two reference public annotations still presents at least 80% of the genes simply classified as hypothetical or putative proteins. Furthermore, it is notable the absence of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences fromLeishmaniaspecies in public databases. These poorly annotated coding genes and ncRNAs could be important players for the understanding of this protozoan biology, the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions and disease control. Herein, we performed a new prediction and annotation ofL. braziliensisprotein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, using recently developed predictive algorithms and updated databases. In summary, we identified 11 491 ORFs, with 5263 (45.80%) of them associated with proteins available in public databases. Moreover, we identified for the first time the repertoire of 11 243 ncRNAs belonging to different classes distributed along the genome. The accuracy of our predictions was verified by transcriptional evidence using RNA-seq, confirming that they are actually generating real transcripts. These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com), which represents an improvement on the publicly available data related to genomic annotation forL. braziliensis.

In developing MGIS, we selected a generic database schema (Chado), the robust content management system Drupal for the user interface, and Tripal, a set of Drupal modules which links the Chado schema to Drupal. MGIS allows germplasm collection examination, accession browsing, advanced search functions, and germplasm orders. Additionally, we developed unique graphical interfaces to compare accessions and to explore them based on their taxonomic information.

19	http://www.mirnalyze.in	20	[126]	miRnalyze	The various pathophysiological processes occurring in living systems are known to be orchestrated by delicate interplays and cross-talks between different genes and their regulators. Among the various regulators of genes, there is a class of small non-coding RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Although, the relative simplicity of miRNAs and their ability to modulate cellular processes make them attractive therapeutic candidates, their presence in large numbers make it challenging for experimental researchers to interpret the intricacies of the molecular processes they regulate. Most of the existing bioinformatic tools fail to address these challenges. Here, we present a new web resource ‘miRnalyze’ that has been specifically designed to directly identify the putative regulation of cell signaling pathways by miRNAs. The tool integrates miRNA-target predictions with signaling cascade members by utilizing TargetScanHuman 7.1 miRNA-target prediction tool and the KEGG pathway database, and thus provides researchers with in-depth insights into modulation of signal transduction pathways by miRNAs. miRnalyze is capable of identifying common miRNAs targeting more than one gene in the same signaling pathway—a feature that further increases the probability of modulating the pathway and downstream reactions when using miRNA modulators. Additionally, miRnalyze can sort miRNAs according to the seed-match types and TargetScan Context ++ score, thus providing a hierarchical list of most valuable miRNAs. Furthermore, in order to provide users with comprehensive information regarding miRNAs, genes and pathways, miRnalyze also links to expression data of miRNAs (miRmine) and genes (TiGER) and proteome abundance (PaxDb) data. To validate the capability of the tool, we have documented the correlation of miRnalyze’s prediction with experimental confirmation studies.Database URL:http://www.mirnalyze.in	0.0	19	20	169	132	195	102	0.245459650592	0.238136933061	0.212373385668	0.16206895834	-2.65479335965	3.2852587078	-5.61649023983	NULL	1.15277615873	-9.05976200743

However, the rate at which new information is being published makes manual curation increasingly unable to cope. Devising new curation strategies that leverage upon data mining and text analysis is, therefore, a promising avenue to help life science databases to cope with the deluge of novel information. In this article, we describe the integration of text mining technologies in the curation pipeline of the RegulonDB database, and discuss how the process can enhance the productivity of the curators.Specifically, a named entity recognition approach is used to pre-annotate terms referring to a set of domain entities which are potentially relevant for the curation process. The annotated documents are presented to the curator, who, thanks to a custom-designed interface, can select sentences containing specific types of entities, thus restricting the amount of text that needs to be inspected. Additionally, a module capable of computing semantic similarity between sentences across the entire collection of articles to be curated is being integrated in the system. We tested the module using three sets of scientific articles and six domain experts. All these improvements are gradually enabling us to obtain a high throughput curation process with the same quality as manual curation.	0.0	13	21	266	254	242	257	0.322218666625	0.252963445817	0.248981843913	0.217315557742	4.75843098506	0.613508720999	0.541716858079	NULL	8.53767206542	1.33002408952

This will facilitate the reuse of these data for further analysis. We have collected genomic data for 86 silkworm pathogens from 4 taxa (fungi, microsporidia, bacteria and viruses) and from 4 lepidopteran hosts, and developed the open-access Silkworm Pathogen Database (SilkPathDB) to make this information readily available. The implementation of SilkPathDB involves integrating Drupal and GBrowse as a graphic interface for a Chado relational database which houses all of the datasets involved. The genomes have been assembled and annotated for comparative purposes and allow the search and analysis of homologous sequences, transposable elements, protein subcellular locations, including secreted proteins, and gene ontology.

These environmental metagenomic sequences often show little or no similarity to AR sequences from clinical isolates using standard classification criteria. In addition, existing AR databases provide no information about flanking sequences containing regulatory or mobile genetic elements. To help address this issue, we created an annotated database of DNA and protein sequences derived exclusively from environmental metagenomic sequences showing AR in laboratory experiments.

Machine Learning (ML) methods are becoming fundamental in annotating unknown proteins and their heterogeneous properties. We present ASAP (Amino-acid Sequence Annotation Prediction), a universal ML framework for predicting residue-level properties. ASAP extracts numerous features from raw sequences, and supports easy integration of external features such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, intrinsically disorder or PSSM profiles. Features are then used to train ML classifiers. ASAP can create new classifiers within minutes for a variety of tasks, including PTM prediction (e.g. cleavage sites by convertase, phosphoserine modification). We present a detailed case study for ASAP: CleavePred, an ASAP-based model to predict protein precursor cleavage sites, with state-of-the-art results. Protein cleavage is a PTM shared by a wide variety of proteins sharing minimal sequence similarity. Current rule-based methods suffer from high false positive rates, making them suboptimal. The high performance of CleavePred makes it suitable for analyzing new proteomes at a genomic scale. The tool is attractive to protein design, mass spectrometry search engines and the discovery of new bioactive peptides from precursors.

This information needs to be concise and consistent in today’s ever-increasing bioinformatic era, for complementary data aggregators to easily map databases to one another. In order to facilitate exchange of information on genomic samples and their derived data, the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) Data Standard is intended to provide a platform based on a documented agreement to promote the efficient sharing and usage of genomic sample material and associated specimen information in a consistent way. The new data standard presented here build upon existing standards commonly used within the community extending them with the capability to exchange data on tissue, environmental and DNA sample as well as sequences.

In this paper, we describe the framework of the collaborative BioC task and discuss our findings based on the user survey. This track consisted of eight subtasks including gene/protein/organism named entity recognition, protein–protein/genetic interaction passage identification and annotation visualization. Using BioC as their data-sharing and communication medium, nine teams, world-wide, participated and contributed either new methods or improvements of existing tools to address different subtasks of the BioC track. Results from different teams were shared in BioC and made available to other teams as they addressed different subtasks of the track. In the end, all submitted runs were merged using a machine learning classifier to produce an optimized output.

As all of these data were derived from the same diverse panel of lines, the database also allows various types of genetic mapping (including characterization of phenotypic QTLs, pQTLs; expression QTLs, eQTLs and metabolic QTLs, mQTLs). MODEM is thus designed to promote a better understanding of maize genetic architecture and deep functional annotation of the complex maize genome (and potentially those of other crop plants) and to explore the genotype–phenotype relationships and regulation of maize kernel development at multiple scales, which is also comprehensive for developing novel methods. MODEM is additionally designed to link with other databases to make full use of current resources, and it provides visualization tools for easy browsing.

USP works by extending a given DNA motif, in 5′→3′, 3′ →5′ or both directions by adding one nucleotide at each step, and calculates the frequency of each extended motif in the genome by Frequency Counter programme. This step is iterated till the frequency of the extended motif becomes unity in the genome. Thus, for each given motif, we get three possible unique sequences. Closest Sequence Finder program predicts off-target drug binding in the genome. Inclusion of DNA-Protein structural information further makes Onco-Regulon a highly informative repository for gene specific drug development.

Regulatory transcription factors (TFs) symbolize a key component of the genome and are the most significant targets for producing stress tolerant crop and hence functional genomic studies of these TFs are important. Therefore, here we have constructed a web-accessible TFs database forP. vulgaris, called PvTFDB, which contains 2370 putative TF gene models in 49 TF families. This database provides a comprehensive information for each of the identified TF that includes sequence data, functional annotation, SSRs with their primer sets, protein physical properties, chromosomal location, phylogeny, tissue-specific gene expression data, orthologues,cis-regulatory elements and gene ontology (GO) assignment. Altogether, this information would be used in expediting the functional genomic studies of a specific TF(s) of interest. The objectives of this database are to understand functional genomics study of common bean TFs and recognize the regulatory mechanisms underlying various stress responses to ease breeding strategy for variety production through a couple of search interfaces including gene ID, functional annotation and browsing interfaces including by family and by chromosome.

Nevertheless, the misalignment between text and annotations happens quite often because different systems tend to use different software development environments, e.g. ASCII vs. Unicode. We first implemented the BioC Viewer to assist BioGRID curators as a part of the BioCreative V BioC track (Collaborative Biocurator Assistant Task). For the BioC track, the BioC Viewer helped curate protein-protein interaction and genetic interaction pairs appearing in full-text articles. Here, we describe the BioC Viewer itself as well as improvements made to the BioC Viewer since the BioCreative V Workshop to address the misalignment issue of BioC annotations. While uploading BioC files, a BioC merge process is offered when there are files from the same full-text article. If there is a mismatch between an annotated offset and text, the BioC Viewer adjusts the offset to correctly align with the text.

Whereas, many public databases of Eukaryotic multi-exon genes are available, there are only two specialized databases for SEGs. The present work addresses the need for a more extensive and diverse database by creating SinEx DB, a publicly available, searchable database of predicted SEGs from 10 completely sequenced mammalian genomes including human. SinEx DB houses the DNA and protein sequence information of these SEGs and includes their functional predictions (KOG) and the relative distribution of these functions within species.

To help the scientific community and database curators deal with this issue, we have developed an application, neXtA5, which prioritizes the literature for specific curation requirements. Our system, neXtA5, is a curation service composed of three main elements. The first component is a named-entity recognition module, which annotates MEDLINE over some predefined axes. This report focuses on three axes: Diseases, the Molecular Function and Biological Process sub-ontologies of the Gene Ontology (GO). The automatic annotations are then stored in a local database, BioMed, for each annotation axis. Additional entities such as species and chemical compounds are also identified. The second component is an existing search engine, which retrieves the most relevant MEDLINE records for any given query. The third component uses the content of BioMed to generate an axis-specific ranking, which takes into account the density of named-entities as stored in the Biomed database. The two ranked lists are ultimately merged using a linear combination, which has been specifically tuned to support the annotation of each axis. The fine-tuning of the coefficients is formally reported for each axis-driven search. Compared with PubMed, which is the system used by most curators, the improvement is the following: +231% for Diseases, +236% for Molecular Functions and +3153% for Biological Process when measuring the precision of the top-returned PMID (P0 or mean reciprocal rank). The current search methods significantly improve the search effectiveness of curators for three important curation axes. Further experiments are being performed to extend the curation types, in particular protein–protein interactions, which require specific relationship extraction capabilities. In parallel, user-friendly interfaces powered with a set of JSON web services are currently being implemented into the neXtProt annotation pipeline.Available on:http://babar.unige.ch:8082/neXtA5Database URL:http://babar.unige.ch:8082/neXtA5/fetcher.jsp	0.0	5	47	21	186	198	266	0.204403195838	0.156537800865	0.146851776786	0.141549797292	4.88244145306	-0.419442573009	0.134610826493	NULL	8.55603130003	0.851233309076

Conducting simulation studies can become a complicated task as several challenges can occur, such as the selection of an appropriate simulation tool and the specification of parameters in the simulation model. Although abundant simulated data have been generated for human genetic research, currently there is no public database designed specifically as a repository for these simulated data. With the lack of such a database, for similar studies, similar simulations may have been repeated, which resulted in redundant work. Thus, we created an online platform, the Genetic Epidemiology Simulation Database (GESDB), for simulation data sharing and discussion of simulation techniques for genetic epidemiology studies. GESDB consists of a database for storing simulation scripts, simulated data and documentation from published articles as well as a discussion forum, which provides a platform for discussion of the simulated data and exchanging simulation ideas. Moreover, summary statistics such as the simulation tools that are most commonly used and datasets that are most frequently downloaded are provided. The statistics will be informative for researchers to choose an appropriate simulation tool or select a common dataset for method comparisons.

Several arthropod genomes are available at present and many others will be sequenced in the near future in the context of the i5K initiative, offering opportunities for reconstructing, modelling and comparing their metabolic networks. In-depth analysis of these genomic data through metabolism reconstruction is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the biology of arthropods, thereby allowing the development of new strategies to control harmful species. In this context, we present here ArthropodaCyc, a dedicated BioCyc collection of databases using the Cyc annotation database system (CycADS), allowing researchers to perform reliable metabolism comparisons of fully sequenced arthropods genomes. Since the annotation quality is a key factor when performing such global genome comparisons, all proteins from the genomes included in the ArthropodaCyc database were re-annotated using several annotation tools and orthology information. All functional/domain annotation results and their sources were integrated in the databases for user access. Currently, ArthropodaCyc offers a centralized repository of metabolic pathways, protein sequence domains, Gene Ontology annotations as well as evolutionary information for 28 arthropod species.

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA elements frequently found in plants and are suggested to play important roles in plant sex chromosome evolution. The genomes of several dioecious plants have been sequenced, offering an opportunity to annotate and mine the TE data. However, comprehensive and unified annotation of TEs in these dioecious plants is still lacking. In this study, we constructed a dioecious plant transposable element database (DPTEdb). DPTEdb is a specific, comprehensive and unified relational database and web interface. We used a combination ofde novo, structure-based and homology-based approaches to identify TEs from the genome assemblies of previously published data, as well as our own. The database currently integrates eight dioecious plant species and a total of 31 340 TEs along with classification information. DPTEdb provides user-friendly web interfaces to browse, search and download the TE sequences in the database. Users can also use tools, including BLAST, GetORF, HMMER, Cut sequence and JBrowse, to analyze TE data. Given the role of TEs in plant sex chromosome evolution, the database will contribute to the investigation of TEs in structural, functional and evolutionary dynamics of the genome of dioecious plants.

Launched in 2011 and built by the same core team as the successful MIBBI portal, BioSharing harnesses community curation to collate and cross-reference resources across the life sciences from around the world. BioSharing makes these resources findable and accessible (the core of the FAIR principle). Every record is designed to be interlinked, providing a detailed description not only on the resource itself, but also on its relations with other life science infrastructures. Serving a variety of stakeholders, BioSharing cultivates a growing community, to which it offers diverse benefits. It is a resource for funding bodies and journal publishers to navigate the metadata landscape of the biological sciences; an educational resource for librarians and information advisors; a publicising platform for standard and database developers/curators; and a research tool for bench and computer scientists to plan their work. BioSharing is working with an increasing number of journals and other registries, for example linking standards and databases to training material and tools. Driven by an international Advisory Board, the BioSharing user-base has grown by over 40% (by unique IP address), in the last year thanks to successful engagement with researchers, publishers, librarians, developers and other stakeholders via several routes, including a joint RDA/Force11 working group and a collaboration with the International Society for Biocuration.

With Argo's graphical annotation interface, domain experts can then make use of the workflows' automatically generated output to curate information of interest.With the continuously rising need to understand the aetiology of diseases as well as the demand for their informed diagnosis and personalised treatment, the curation of disease-relevant information from medical and clinical documents has become an indispensable scientific activity. In the Fifth BioCreative Challenge Evaluation Workshop (BioCreative V), there was substantial interest in the mining of literature for disease-relevant information. Apart from a panel discussion focussed on disease annotations, the chemical-disease relations (CDR) track was also organised to foster the sharing and advancement of disease annotation tools and resources.This article presents the application of Argo’s capabilities to the literature-based annotation of diseases. As part of our participation in BioCreative V’s User Interactive Track (IAT), we demonstrated and evaluated Argo’s suitability to the semi-automatic curation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotypes.

CollecTF is a community-oriented database documenting experimentally validated transcription factor (TF)-binding sites in the Bacteria domain. In its quest to become a community resource for the annotation of transcriptional regulatory elements in bacterial genomes, CollecTF aims to move away from the conventional data-repository paradigm of domain-specific databases. Through the adoption of well-established ontologies, identifiers and collaborations, CollecTF has progressively become also a portal for the annotation and submission of information on transcriptional regulatory elements to major biological sequence resources (RefSeq, UniProtKB and the Gene Ontology Consortium). This fundamental change in database conception capitalizes on the domain-specific knowledge of contributing communities to provide high-quality annotations, while leveraging the availability of stable information hubs to promote long-term access and provide high-visibility to the data. As a submission portal, CollecTF generates TF-binding site information through direct annotation of RefSeq genome records, definition of TF-based regulatory networks in UniProtKB entries and submission of functional annotations to the Gene Ontology. As a database, CollecTF provides enhanced search and browsing, targeted data exports, binding motif analysis tools and integration with motif discovery and search platforms.

However, there exist no resources for the exploration of E3-ligase-associated regulatory networks of for ubiquitylated proteins in humans. Therefore, the UbiNet database was developed to provide a full investigation of protein ubiquitylation networks by incorporating experimentally verified E3 ligases, ubiquitylated substrates and protein–protein interactions (PPIs). To date, UbiNet has accumulated 43 948 experimentally verified ubiquitylation sites from 14 692 ubiquitylated proteins of humans. Additionally, we have manually curated 499 E3 ligases as well as two E1 activating and 46 E2 conjugating enzymes. To delineate the regulatory networks among E3 ligases and ubiquitylated proteins, a total of 430 530 PPIs were integrated into UbiNet for the exploration of ubiquitylation networks with an interactive network viewer. A case study demonstrated that UbiNet was able to decipher a scheme for the ubiquitylation of tumor proteins p63 and p73 that is consistent with their functions. Although the essential role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is well studied, UbiNet revealed that Mdm2 and additional E3 ligases might be implicated in the regulation of other tumor proteins by protein ubiquitylation.

However, no effective vaccine that protects the host from HIV infection is available and HIV is still spreading at an alarming rate, despite effective antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. In order to develop effective therapies, we need to expand our knowledge of the interaction between HIV and host proteins. In contrast to virus proteins, which often rapidly evolve drug resistance mutations, the host proteins are essentially invariant within all humans. Thus, if we can identify the host proteins needed for virus replication, such as those involved in transporting viral proteins to the cell surface, we have a chance of interrupting viral replication. There is no proteome resource that summarizes this interaction, making research on this subject a difficult enterprise. In order to fill this gap in knowledge, we curated a resource presents detailed annotation on the interaction between the HIV proteome and host proteins. Our resource was produced in collaboration with ViralZone and used manual curation techniques developed by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

As next-generation sequencing technologies improve, the amount of literature containing genomic variant data, such as new functions or related phenotypes, rapidly increases. Because numerous articles are published every day, it is almost impossible to manually curate all the variant information from the literature. Many researchers focus on creating an improved automated biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) method that extracts useful variants and their functional information from the literature. However, there is no gold-standard data set that contains texts annotated with variants and their related functions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Biomedical entity Relation ONcology COrpus (BRONCO) that contains more than 400 variants and their relations with genes, diseases, drugs and cell lines in the context of cancer and anti-tumor drug screening research.

SCI experimental methods, data and domain knowledge are locked in the largely unstructured text of scientific publications, making large scale integration with existing bioinformatics resources and subsequent analysis infeasible. The lack of standard reporting for experiment variables and results also makes experiment replicability a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we have developed RegenBase, a knowledge base of SCI biology. RegenBase integrates curated literature-sourced facts and experimental details, raw assay data profiling the effect of compounds on enzyme activity and cell growth, and structured SCI domain knowledge in the form of the first ontology for SCI, using Semantic Web representation languages and frameworks. RegenBase uses consistent identifier schemes and data representations that enable automated linking among RegenBase statements and also to other biological databases and electronic resources.

Although several international consortia and public resource centres offer services for plant research data management, valuable digital assets remains unpublished and thus inaccessible to the scientific community. Recently, the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research and the German Plant Phenotyping Network have jointly initiated the Plant Genomics and Phenomics Research Data Repository (PGP) as infrastructure to comprehensively publish plant research data. This covers in particular cross-domain datasets that are not being published in central repositories because of its volume or unsupported data scope, like image collections from plant phenotyping and microscopy, unfinished genomes, genotyping data, visualizations of morphological plant models, data from mass spectrometry as well as software and documents.The repository is hosted at Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research using e!DAL as software infrastructure and a Hierarchical Storage Management System as data archival backend. A novel developed data submission tool was made available for the consortium that features a high level of automation to lower the barriers of data publication. After an internal review process, data are published as citable digital object identifiers and a core set of technical metadata is registered at DataCite. The used e!DAL-embedded Web frontend generates for each dataset a landing page and supports an interactive exploration.

Different literature searches of MEDLINE abstracts were performed using specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) for oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. A curated gene-to-publication assignment yielded a total of 1370 genes related to HN cancer. The diversity of results allowed identifying novel and mostly unexplored gene associations, revealing,for example, that processes linked to response to steroid hormone stimulus are significantly enriched in genes related to HN carcinomas.

Current standardized methodologies are based on microscopic determinations, which is time consuming and prone to identification uncertainties. The use of DNA-barcoding has been proposed as a way to avoid these flaws. Combining barcoding with next-generation sequencing enables collection of a large quantity of barcodes from natural samples. These barcodes are identified as certain diatom taxa by comparing the sequences to a reference barcoding library using algorithms. Proof of concept was recently demonstrated for synthetic and natural communities and underlined the importance of the quality of this reference library. We present an open-access and curated reference barcoding database for diatoms, called R-Syst::diatom, developed in the framework of R-Syst, the network of systematic supported by INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research), seehttp://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en. R-Syst::diatom links DNA-barcodes to their taxonomical identifications, and is dedicated to identify barcodes from natural samples. The data come from two sources, a culture collection of freshwater algae maintained in INRA in which new strains are regularly deposited and barcoded and from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) nucleotide database. Two kinds of barcodes were chosen to support the database: 18S (18S ribosomal RNA) andrbcL (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), because of their efficiency. Data are curated using innovative (Declic) and classical bioinformatic tools (Blast, classical phylogenies) and up-to-date taxonomy (Catalogues and peer reviewed papers). Every 6 months R-Syst::diatom is updated.

We included gene sets associated with severity, concurrent conditions, tissue sources and networks. The published scientific literature is the primary repository for all information documenting human disease. We used semantic data mining to retrieve and extract the articles pertaining to preeclampsia-associated genes and performed manual curation. We deposited the articles, genes, preeclampsia phenotypes and other supporting information into the dbPEC. It is publicly available and freely accessible. Previously, we developed a database for preterm birth (dbPTB) using a similar approach. Using the gene sets in dbPTB, we were able to successfully analyze a genome-wide study of preterm birth including 4000 women and children. We identified important genes and pathways associated with preterm birth that were not otherwise demonstrable using genome-wide approaches. dbPEC serves not only as a resources for genes and articles associated with preeclampsia, it is a robust source of gene sets to analyze a wide range of high-throughput data for gene set enrichment analysis.Database URL:http://ptbdb.cs.brown.edu/dbpec/	0.0	6	85	272	155	258	257	0.328130042693	0.106699578915	0.104142195882	0.101810686911	2.32423676939	5.68341966772	-4.00932306926	NULL	-2.55312269847	-6.97766370911

However, sample manual annotation is a highly labor intensive process and requires familiarity with the terminologies used. We have therefore developed an interactive annotation tool, EXTRACT, which helps curators identify and extract standard-compliant terms for annotation of metagenomic records and other samples. Behind its web-based user interface, the system combines published methods for named entity recognition of environment, organism, tissue and disease terms. The evaluators in the BioCreative V Interactive Annotation Task found the system to be intuitive, useful, well documented and sufficiently accurate to be helpful in spotting relevant text passages and extracting organism and environment terms. Comparison of fully manual and text-mining-assisted curation revealed that EXTRACT speeds up annotation by 15–25% and helps curators to detect terms that would otherwise have been missed.Database URL:https://extract.hcmr.gr/	2.0	7	86	192	21	198	266	0.241291387378	0.194593223787	0.193220751764	0.178247067083	3.18968526984	1.45043865069	1.83453553051	NULL	7.54778010738	1.74701407198

Therefore, studies on spatial interactions between chromatin have created a new avenue for elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in disease pathogenesis. Recently, a growing number of chromatin interactions have been revealed by means of 3C, 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET and Hi-C technologies. To interpret and utilize these interactions, we constructed chromatin–chromatin spatial interaction (CCSI) database by integrating and annotating 91 sets of chromatin interaction data derived from published literature, UCSC database and NCBI GEO database, resulting in a total of 3 017 962 pairwise interactions (false discovery rate < 0.05), covering human, mouse and yeast.A web interface has been designed to provide access to the chromatin interactions. The main features of CCSI are (i) showing chromatin interactions and corresponding genes, enhancers and SNPs within the regions in the search page; (ii) offering complete interaction datasets, enhancer and SNP information in the download page; and (iii) providing analysis pipeline for the annotation of interaction data.

Unfortunately, the increasing market demand towards virgin olive oil could often result in its adulteration with less expensive oils, which is a serious problem for the public and quality control evaluators of virgin olive oil. Therefore, to avoid frauds, olive cultivar identification and virgin olive oil authentication have become a major issue for the producers and consumers of quality control in the olive chain. Presently, genetic traceability using SSR is the cost effective and powerful marker technique that can be employed to resolve such problems. However, to identify an unknown monovarietal virgin olive oil cultivar, a reference system has become necessary. Thus, an Olive Genetic Diversity Database (OGDD) (http://www.bioinfo-cbs.org/ogdd/) is presented in this work. It is a genetic, morphologic and chemical database of worldwide olive tree and oil having a double function. In fact, besides being a reference system generated for the identification of unkown olive or virgin olive oil cultivars based on their microsatellite allele size(s), it provides users additional morphological and chemical information for each identified cultivar. Currently, OGDD is designed to enable users to easily retrieve and visualize biologically important information (SSR markers, and olive tree and oil characteristics of about 200 cultivars worldwide) using a set of efficient query interfaces and analysis tools.

Currently, there are numerous databases that offer information on specific organisms or models, but none offer a global understanding on relationships between organisms, their interactions and capabilities within their niche, as well as their role as part of a system, in this case, their role in symbiosis. We have developed the SymbioGenomesDB as a community database resource for laboratories which intend to investigate and use information on the genetics and the genomics of organisms involved in these relationships. The ultimate goal of SymbioGenomesDB is to host and support the growing and vast symbiotic–host relationship information, to uncover the genetic basis of such associations. SymbioGenomesDB maintains a comprehensive organization of information on genomes of symbionts from diverse hosts throughout the Tree of Life, including their sequences, their metadata and their genomic features. This catalog of relationships was generated using computational tools, custom R scripts and manual integration of data available in public literature. As a highly curated and comprehensive systems database, SymbioGenomesDB provides web access to all the information of symbiotic organisms, their features and links to the central database NCBI.

Over the past decade, high-throughput technologies such as the Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays have provided new perspectives into the pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Public transcriptomic data repositories, namely Gene Expression Omnibus and curated ArrayExpress, enable researchers to conduct integrative meta-analysis; increasing the power to detect differentially regulated genes in disease and explore patterns of gene dysregulation across biologically related studies. The reliability of retrospective, large-scale integrative analyses depends on an appropriate combination of related datasets, in turn requiring detailed meta-annotations capturing the experimental setup. In most cases, we observe huge variation in compliance to defined standards for submitted metadata in public databases. Much of the information to complete, or refine meta-annotations are distributed in the associated publications. For example, tissue preparation or comorbidity information is frequently described in an article’s supplementary tables. Several value-added databases have employed additional manual efforts to overcome this limitation. However, none of these databases explicate annotations that distinguish human and animal models in neurodegeneration context. Therefore, adopting a more specific disease focus, in combination with dedicated disease ontologies, will better empower the selection of comparable studies with refined annotations to address the research question at hand. In this article, we describe the detailed development ofNeuroTransDB,a manually curated database containing metadata annotations for neurodegenerative studies.

Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs are themselves regulated by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or ‘miRNA sponges’ that contain miRNA binding sites. These competitive molecules can sequester miRNAs to prevent them interacting with their natural targets to play critical roles in various biological and pathological processes. It has become increasingly important to develop a high quality database to record and store ceRNA data to support future studies. To this end, we have established the experimentally supported miRSponge database that contains data on 599 miRNA-sponge interactions and 463 ceRNA relationships from 11 species following manual curating from nearly 1200 published articles. Database classes include endogenously generated molecules including coding genes, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, along with exogenously introduced molecules including viral RNAs and artificial engineered sponges. Approximately 70% of the interactions were identified experimentally in disease states. miRSponge provides a user-friendly interface for convenient browsing, retrieval and downloading of dataset. A submission page is also included to allow researchers to submit newly validated miRNA sponge data.Database URL:http://www.bio-bigdata.net/miRSponge.	2.0	6	102	169	60	180	205	0.211498415171	0.199765830213	0.190864065284	0.170624290901	-2.61258331021	4.79954718709	-4.89909073518	NULL	1.45908896676	-8.66705873472
107	http://www.regnetworkweb.org	108	NULL	RegNetwork	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance to numerous biological processes. Nowadays, an increasing amount of gene regulatory relationships have been documented in various databases and literature. However, to more efficiently exploit such knowledge for biomedical research and applications, it is necessary to construct a genome-wide regulatory network database to integrate the information on gene regulatory relationships that are widely scattered in many different places. Therefore, in this work, we build a knowledge-based database, named ‘RegNetwork’, of gene regulatory networks for human and mouse by collecting and integrating the documented regulatory interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes from 25 selected databases. Moreover, we also inferred and incorporated potential regulatory relationships based on transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs into RegNetwork. As a result, RegNetwork contains a comprehensive set of experimentally observed or predicted transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships, and the database framework is flexibly designed for potential extensions to include gene regulatory networks for other organisms in the future. Based on RegNetwork, we characterized the statistical and topological properties of genome-wide regulatory networks for human and mouse, we also extracted and interpreted simple yet important network motifs that involve the interplays between TF-miRNA and their targets. In summary, RegNetwork provides an integrated resource on the prior information for gene regulatory relationships, and it enables us to further investigate context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions based on domain-specific experimental data.Database URL:http://www.regnetworkweb.org	4.0	11	103	209	132	141	111	0.320004354245	0.26174431829	0.230919432106	0.225809498894	-1.95691601335	0.97312730149	-4.3061889945	NULL	3.07494744353	-5.78528284804

The aim of our portal comprehensive resources for cancer NGS data analysis (CRCDA) is to provide a collection of different NGS tools and pipelines under diverse classes with cancer pathways and databases and furthermore, literature information from PubMed. The literature data was constrained to 18 most common cancer types such as breast cancer, colon cancer and other cancers that exhibit in worldwide population. NGS-cancer tools for the convenience have been categorized into cancer genomics, cancer transcriptomics, cancer epigenomics, quality control and visualization. Pipelines for variant detection, quality control and data analysis were listed to provide out-of-the box solution for NGS data analysis, which may help researchers to overcome challenges in selecting and configuring individual tools for analysing exome, whole genome and transcriptome data. An extensive search page was developed that can be queried by using (i) type of data [literature, gene data and sequence read archive (SRA) data] and (ii) type of cancer (selected based on global incidence and accessibility of data). For each category of analysis, variety of tools are available and the biggest challenge is in searching and using the right tool for the right application. The objective of the work is collecting tools in each category available at various places and arranging the tools and other data in a simple and user-friendly manner for biologists and oncologists to find information easier. To the best of our knowledge, we have collected and presented a comprehensive package of most of the resources available in cancer for NGS data analysis.

However, it is unlikely that all studies will use the same data collection protocols. As a result, retrospective standardization is often required, which involves matching of original (unstructured or locally coded) data to widely used coding or ontology systems such as SNOMED CT (clinical terms), ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease) and HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology). This data curation process is usually a time-consuming process performed by a human expert. To help mechanize this process, we have developed SORTA, a computer-aided system for rapidly encoding free text or locally coded values to a formal coding system or ontology. SORTA matches original data values (uploaded in semicolon delimited format) to a target coding system (uploaded in Excel spreadsheet, OWL ontology web language or OBO open biomedical ontologies format). It then semi- automatically shortlists candidate codes for each data value using Lucene and n-gram based matching algorithms, and can also learn from matches chosen by human experts. We evaluated SORTA’s applicability in two use cases. For the LifeLines biobank, we used SORTA to recode 90 000 free text values (including 5211 unique values) about physical exercise to MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) codes. For the CINEAS clinical symptom coding system, we used SORTA to map to HPO, enriching HPO when necessary (315 terms matched so far). Out of the shortlists at rank 1, we found a precision/recall of 0.97/0.98 in LifeLines and of 0.58/0.45 in CINEAS. More importantly, users found the tool both a major time saver and a quality improvement because SORTA reduced the chances of human mistakes. Thus, SORTA can dramatically ease data (re)coding tasks and we believe it will prove useful for many more projects.Database URL:http://molgenis.org/sortaor as an open source download fromhttp://www.molgenis.org/wiki/SORTA	1.0	6	106	97	183	254	255	0.107074288737	0.10493305483	0.0981949782813	0.0931169471068	5.398747049	0.909395066533	-2.42402040971	NULL	9.7198899286	-1.63118485333

There are on-going efforts to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the stage transition process via the application of high-throughput epigenomics, genomics and proteomics techniques. Given the range of experimental conditions and the typical yield from such high-throughput techniques, a new challenge arises: how to effectively collect, organize and disseminate the generated data for subsequent data analysis. Here, we describe toxoMine, which provides a powerful interface to support sophisticated integrative exploration of high-throughput experimental data and metadata, providing researchers with a more tractable means toward understanding how genetic and/or epigenetic factors play a coordinated role in determining pathogenicity ofT. gondii. As a data warehouse, toxoMine allows integration of high-throughput data sets with publicT. gondiidata. toxoMine is also able to execute complex queries involving multiple data sets with straightforward user interaction. Furthermore, toxoMine allows users to define their own parameters during the search process that gives users near-limitless search and query capabilities. The interoperability feature also allows users to query and examine data available in other InterMine systems, which would effectively augment the search scope beyond what is available to toxoMine. toxoMine complements the major community database ToxoDB by providing a data warehouse that enables more extensive integrative studies forT. gondii. Given all these factors, we believe it will become an indispensable resource to the greater infectious disease research community.Database URL:http://toxomine.org	0.0	5	118	226	227	128	253	0.120352152721	0.108875126178	0.0995994177226	0.0962029715935	-1.58177945708	2.70588548484	2.18941667142	NULL	-0.643365409472	-2.52182013777

However, a comprehensive resource for cataloguing the evolutionary rate at codon sites and their corresponding nucleotide and protein domain sequence alignments has not been developed. To address this gap in knowledge, EvoDB (an Evolutionary rates DataBase) was compiled. Nucleotide sequences and their corresponding protein domain data including the associated seed alignments from the PFAM-A (protein family) database were used to estimate evolutionary rate (ω = dN/dS) profiles at codon sites for each entry. EvoDB contains 98.83% of the gapped nucleotide sequence alignments and 97.1% of the evolutionary rate profiles for the corresponding information in PFAM-A. As the identification of codon sites under positive selection and their position in a sequence profile is usually the most sought after information for molecular evolutionary biologists, evolutionary rate profiles were determined under the M2a model using the CODEML algorithm in the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) suite of software. Validation of nucleotide sequences against amino acid data was implemented to ensure high data quality. EvoDB is a catalogue of the evolutionary rate profiles and provides the corresponding phylogenetic trees, PFAM-A alignments and annotated accession identifier data. In addition, the database can be explored and queried using known evolutionary rate profiles to identify domains under similar evolutionary constraints and pressures. EvoDB is a resource for evolutionary, phylogenetic studies and presents a tier of information untapped by current databases.Database URL:http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/fire/evodb	0.0	5	119	203	82	267	163	0.156800990011	0.139634053383	0.13831581414	0.1031988045	-0.0309202523924	-4.88002992176	3.74675222091	NULL	-1.50001836183	3.75218447911

To accelerate the identification and functional understanding of T3SEs, we present BEAN 2.0 as an integrated web resource to predict, analyse and store T3SEs. BEAN 2.0 includes three major components. First, it provides an accurate T3SE predictor based on a hybrid approach. Using independent testing data, we show that BEAN 2.0 achieves a sensitivity of 86.05% and a specificity of 100%. Second, it integrates a set of online sequence analysis tools. Users can further perform functional analysis of putative T3SEs in a seamless way, such as subcellular location prediction, functional domain scan and disorder region annotation. Third, it compiles a database covering 1215 experimentally verified T3SEs and constructs two T3SE-related networks that can be used to explore the relationships among T3SEs. Taken together, by presenting a one-stop T3SE bioinformatics resource, we hope BEAN 2.0 can promote comprehensive understanding of the function and evolution of T3SEs.Database URL:http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/bean/	1.0	5	120	41	27	261	24	0.170737436771	0.132613779074	0.113758508618	0.113457696577	-3.4770482504	0.675787453128	-2.39694271983	NULL	2.40975077996	-4.69497399117

A simple, regular motif was originally proposed to describe G4-forming sequences. More recently, however, formation of G4 was discovered to depend, at least in part, on the contextual backdrop of neighboring sequences. Prediction of G4 folding is thus becoming more challenging as G4 outlier structures, not described by the originally proposed motif, are increasingly reported. Recent observations thus call for a comprehensive tool, capable of consolidating the expanding information on tested G4s, in order to conduct systematic comparative analyses of G4-promoting sequences. The G4RNA Database we propose was designed to help meet the need for easily-retrievable data on known RNA G4s. A user-friendly, flexible query system allows for data retrieval on experimentally tested sequences, from many separate genes, to assess G4-folding potential. Query output sorts data according to sequence position, G4 likelihood, experimental outcomes and associated bibliographical references.

In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of identified neuropeptides. Therefore, we have developed NeuroPep, a comprehensive resource of neuropeptides, which holds 5949 non-redundant neuropeptide entries originating from 493 organisms belonging to 65 neuropeptide families. In NeuroPep, the number of neuropeptides in invertebrates and vertebrates is 3455 and 2406, respectively. It is currently the most complete neuropeptide database. We extracted entries deposited in UniProt, the database (www.neuropeptides.nl) and NeuroPedia, and used text mining methods to retrieve entries from the MEDLINE abstracts and full text articles. All the entries in NeuroPep have been manually checked. 2069 of the 5949 (35%) neuropeptide sequences were collected from the scientific literature. Moreover, NeuroPep contains detailed annotations for each entry, including source organisms, tissue specificity, families, names, post-translational modifications, 3D structures (if available) and literature references. Information derived from these peptide sequences such as amino acid compositions, isoelectric points, molecular weight and other physicochemical properties of peptides are also provided. A quick search feature allows users to search the database with keywords such as sequence, name, family, etc., and an advanced search page helps users to combine queries with logical operators like AND/OR.

The third generation of proteomics was provoked to bridge this gap. Targeted and untargeted post-translational modification (PTM) studies are the most important parts of today’s proteomics. Considering the expensive and time-consuming nature of experimental methods, computational methods are developed to study, analyze, predict, count and compute the PTM annotations on proteins. The enrichment analysis softwares are among the common computational biology and bioinformatic software packages. The focus of such softwares is to find the probability of occurrence of the desired biological features in any arbitrary list of genes/proteins. We introduce Post-translational modification Enrichment Integration and Matching Analysis (PEIMAN) software to explore more probable and enriched PTMs on proteins. Here, we also represent the statistics of detected PTM terms used in enrichment analysis in PEIMAN software based on the latest released version of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

142	http://mirgate.bioinfo.cnio.es	143	NULL	miRGate	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding elements involved in the post-transcriptional down-regulation of gene expression through base pairing with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Through this mechanism, several miRNA–mRNA pairs have been described as critical in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including early embryonic development and pathological conditions. Many of these pairs (such as miR-15 b/BCL2 in apoptosis or BART-6/BCL6 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas) were experimentally discovered and/or computationally predicted. Available tools for target prediction are usually based on sequence matching, thermodynamics and conservation, among other approaches. Nevertheless, the main issue on miRNA–mRNA pair prediction is the little overlapping results among different prediction methods, or even with experimentally validated pairs lists, despite the fact that all rely on similar principles. To circumvent this problem, we have developed miRGate, a database containing novel computational predicted miRNA–mRNA pairs that are calculated using well-established algorithms. In addition, it includes an updated and complete dataset of sequences for both miRNA and mRNAs 3′-Untranslated region from human (including human viruses), mouse and rat, as well as experimentally validated data from four well-known databases.

The striking ability to survive several stresses usually used for food preservation makesL. monocytogenesone of the biggest concerns to the food industry, while the high mortality of listeriosis in specific groups of humans makes it a great concern for public health. Previous studies have shown that a regulatory network involving alternative sigma (σ) factors and transcription factors is pivotal to stress survival. However, few studies have evaluated at the metabolic networks controlled by these regulatory mechanisms. TheL. monocytogenesBioCyc database uses the strain 10403S as a model. Computer-generated initial annotation for all genes also allowed for identification, annotation and display of predicted reactions and pathways carried out by a single cell. Further ongoing manual curation based on published data as well as database mining for selected genes allowed the more refined annotation of functions, which, in turn, allowed for annotation of new pathways and fine-tuning of previously defined pathways to moreL. monocytogenes-specific pathways. Using RNA-Seq data, several transcription start sites and promoter regions were mapped to the 10403S genome and annotated within the database. Additionally, the identification of promoter regions and a comprehensive review of available literature allowed the annotation of several regulatory interactions involving σ factors and transcription factors.

Phosphorylation can affect protein–protein interactions (PPIs), abolishing interaction with previous binding partners or enabling new interactions. Extracting phosphorylation information coupled with PPI information from the scientific literature will facilitate the creation of phosphorylation interaction networks of kinases, substrates and interacting partners, toward knowledge discovery of functional outcomes of protein phosphorylation. Increasingly, PPI databases are interested in capturing the phosphorylation state of interacting partners. We have previously developed the eFIP (Extracting Functional Impact of Phosphorylation) text mining system, which identifies phosphorylated proteins and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. In this work, we present several enhancements for the eFIP system: (i) text mining for full-length articles from the PubMed Central open-access collection; (ii) the integration of the RLIMS-P 2.0 system for the extraction of phosphorylation events with kinase, substrate and site information; (iii) the extension of the PPI module with new trigger words/phrases describing interactions and (iv) the addition of the iSimp tool for sentence simplification to aid in the matching of syntactic patterns. We enhance the website functionality to: (i) support searches based on protein roles (kinases, substrates, interacting partners) or using keywords; (ii) link protein entities to their corresponding UniProt identifiers if mapped and (iii) support visual exploration of phosphorylation interaction networks using Cytoscape. The evaluation of eFIP on full-length articles achieved 92.4% precision, 76.5% recall and 83.7% F-measure on 100 article sections.

Currently, EpiDBase encompasses 5784 unique ligands (11 422 entries) of various epigenetic markers such as writers, erasers and readers. The EpiDBase includes experimental IC50values, ligand molecular weight, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor count, XlogP, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings, InChIKey, two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures. A catalog of all epidbase ligands based on the molecular weight is also provided. A structure editor is provided for 3D visualization of ligands. EpiDBase is integrated with tools like text search, disease-specific search, advanced search, substructure, and similarity analysis. Advanced analysis can be performed using substructure and OpenBabel-based chemical similarity fingerprints. The EpiDBase is curated to identify unique molecular scaffolds. Initially, molecules were selected by removing peptides, macrocycles and other complex structures and then processed for conformational sampling by generating 3D conformers. Subsequent filtering through Zinc Is Not Commercial (ZINC: a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening) and Lilly MedChem regular rules retained many distinctive drug-like molecules. These molecules were then analyzed for physicochemical properties using OpenBabel descriptors and clustered using various methods such as hierarchical clustering, binning partition and multidimensional scaling. EpiDBase provides comprehensive resources for further design, development and refinement of small molecule modulators of epigenetic markers.Database URL:www.epidbase.org	0.0	6	151	87	201	235	84	0.256957527967	0.192295716048	0.145895321233	0.127650684471	3.95158179597	-5.86239291734	2.54299658057	NULL	-5.4561515133	6.75286555794

The structures and functions of most ncRNAs are however still unknown. Most of the available RNA structural databases rely heavily on known 3D structures, and contextually correlate base pairing geometry with actual 3D RNA structures. None of the databases provide any direct information about stabilization energies. However, the intrinsic interaction energies of constituent base pairs can provide significant insights into their roles in the overall dynamics of RNA motifs and structures. Quantum mechanical (QM) computations provide the only approach toward their accurate quantification and characterization. ‘RNA Base Pair Count, Geometry and Stability’ (http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST) brings together information, extracted from literature data, regarding occurrence frequency, experimental and quantum chemically optimized geometries, and computed interaction energies, for non-canonical base pairs observed in a non-redundant dataset of functional RNA structures. The database is designed to enable the QM community, on the one hand, to identify appropriate biologically relevant model systems and also enable the biology community to easily sift through diverse computational results to gain theoretical insights which could promote hypothesis driven biological research.Database URL:http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST	1.0	5	152	52	121	7	28	0.231290818887	0.157433088116	0.145801441764	0.14250694436	-1.04941828136	-4.5238464448	-2.04754290276	NULL	-4.46714209732	3.70974480099

However, many relevant tools consider a limited number of pathway sources, missing out on many genes and gene-to-gene connections. Simply pooling several pathways sources would result in redundancy and the lack of systematic pathway interrelations. To address this, we exercised a combination of hierarchical clustering and nearest neighbor graph representation, with judiciously selected cutoff values, thereby consolidating 3215 human pathways from 12 sources into a set of 1073 SuperPaths. Our unification algorithm finds a balance between reducing redundancy and optimizing the level of pathway-related informativeness for individual genes. We show a substantial enhancement of the SuperPaths’ capacity to infer gene-to-gene relationships when compared with individual pathway sources, separately or taken together. Further, we demonstrate that the chosen 12 sources entail nearly exhaustive gene coverage. The computed SuperPaths are presented in a new online database, PathCards, showing each SuperPath, its constituent network of pathways, and its contained genes.

ProtoBug platform presents the relatedness of complete proteomes from 17 insects as well as a proteome of the crustacean,Daphnia pulex. The represented proteomes from insects include louse, bee, beetle, ants, flies and mosquitoes. Based on an unsupervised clustering method, protein sequences were clustered into a hierarchical tree, called ProtoBug. ProtoBug covers about 300 000 sequences that are partitioned to families. At the default setting, all sequences are partitioned to ∼20 000 families (excluding singletons). From the species perspective, each of the 18 analysed proteomes is composed of 5000–8000 families. In the regime of the advanced operational mode, the ProtoBug provides rich navigation capabilities for touring the hierarchy of the families at any selected resolution. A proteome viewer shows the composition of sequences from any of the 18 analysed proteomes. Using functional annotation from an expert system (Pfam) we assigned domains, families and repeats by 4400 keywords that cover 73% of the sequences. A strict inference protocol is applied for expanding the functional knowledge. Consequently, secured annotations were associated with 81% of the proteins, and with 70% of the families (≥10 proteins each). ProtoBug is a database and webtool with rich visualization and navigation tools. The properties of each family in relation to other families in the ProtoBug tree, and in view of the taxonomy composition are reported.

However, the majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of key catabolic protein families and of proteins of documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given protein family of AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization of individual protein superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses the deficiencies of homology-based protein function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways.

However, annotation pipelines often do not consider small reading frames likely to be expressed. BactPepDB, available online athttp://bactpepdb.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr, is a database that aims at providing an exhaustive re-annotation of all complete prokaryotic genomes—chromosomal and plasmid DNA—available in RefSeq for coding sequences ranging between 10 and 80 amino acids. The identified peptides are classified as (i) previously identified in RefSeq, (ii) entity-overlapping (intragenic) or intergenic, and (iii) potential pseudogenes—intergenic sequences corresponding to a portion of a previously annotated larger gene. Additional information is related to homologs within order, predicted signal sequence, transmembrane segments, disulfide bonds, secondary structure, and the existence of a related 3D structure in the Protein Databank. As a result, BactPepDB provides insights about candidate peptides, and provides information about their conservation, together with some of their expected biological/structural features.

Kin-driver is a manual expert-curated database that pays special attention to activating mutations (AMs) and can serve as a validation set to develop new generation tools focused on the prediction of gain-of-function driver mutations. It also offers an easy and intuitive environment to facilitate the visualization and analysis of mutations in PKs. Because all mutations are mapped onto a multiple sequence alignment, analogue positions between kinases can be identified and tentative new mutations can be proposed for studying by transferring annotation. Finally, our database can also be of use to clinical and translational laboratories, helping them to identify uncommon AMs that can correlate with response to new antitumor drugs.

To facilitate the exploration of osmoprotectants, we have developed the first online resource, ‘Dragon Explorer of Osmoprotection associated Pathways’ (DEOP) that gathers and presents curated information about osmoprotectants, complemented by information about reactions and pathways that use or affect them. A combined total of 141 compounds were confirmed osmoprotectants, which were matched to 1883 reactions and 834 pathways. DEOP can also be used to map genes or microbial genomes to potential osmoprotection-associated pathways, and thus link genes and genomes to other associated osmoprotection information.

The first objective is to accelerate research involving metagenomic functional interactions by providing a database of metagenomic operon candidates. Proximons represent a special subset of directons (series of contiguous co-directional genes) where each member gene is in close proximity to its neighbours with respect to intergenic distance. As a result, proximons represent significant operon candidates where some subset of proximons is the set of true metagenomic operons. Proximons are well suited for the inference of metagenomic functional networks because predicted functional linkages do not rely on homology-dependent information that is frequently unavailable in metagenomic scenarios. The second objective is to explore representations for semistructured biological data that can offer an alternative to the traditional relational database approach. In particular, we use a serialized object implementation and advocate aData as Datapolicy where the same serialized objects can be used at all levels (database, search tool and saved user file) without conversion or the use of human-readable markups.

Although biomedical research related to biomarkers has increased over the years and substantial effort has been expended to obtain results in these studies, the specific results obtained often contain ambiguities, and the results might contradict each other. Therefore, the information gathered from these studies must be appropriately integrated and organized to facilitate experimentation on biomarkers. In this study, we used liver cancer as the target and developed a text-mining–based curation system named LiverCancerMarkerRIF, which allows users to retrieve biomarker-related narrations and curators to curate supporting evidence on liver cancer biomarkers directly while browsing PubMed. In contrast to most of the other curation tools that require curators to navigate away from PubMed and accommodate distinct user interfaces or Web sites to complete the curation process, our system provides a user-friendly method for accessing text-mining–aided information and a concise interface to assist curators while they remain at the PubMed Web site. Biomedical text-mining techniques are applied to automatically recognize biomedical concepts such as genes, microRNA, diseases and investigative technologies, which can be used to evaluate the potential of a certain gene as a biomarker. Through the participation in the BioCreative IV user-interactive task, we examined the feasibility of using this novel type of augmented browsing-based curation method, and collaborated with curators to curate biomarker evidential sentences related to liver cancer.

Impacts during early neurodevelopment might also predispose to late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. The neural tube develops from its precursor tissue, the neural plate, in a patterning process that is determined by compartmentalization into morphogenetic units, the action of local signaling centers and a well-defined and locally restricted expression of genes and their interactions. While public databases provide gene expression data with spatio-temporal resolution, they usually neglect the genetic interactions that govern neural development. Here, we introduce Mouse IDGenes, a reference database for genetic interactions in the developing mouse brain.

Approximately 50% of all protein-coding human genes harbor multiple polyadenylation (PA) sites; their selective and combinatorial use gives rise to transcript variants with differing length of their 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). Shortened variants escape UTR-mediated regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), especially in cancer, where global 3′UTR shortening accelerates disease progression, dedifferentiation and proliferation. Here we present APADB, a database of vertebrate PA sites determined by 3′ end sequencing, using massive analysis of complementary DNA ends. APADB provides (A)PA sites for coding and non-coding transcripts of human, mouse and chicken genes. For human and mouse, several tissue types, including different cancer specimens, are available. APADB records the loss of predicted miRNA binding sites and visualizes next-generation sequencing reads that support each PA site in a genome browser. The database tables can either be browsed according to organism and tissue or alternatively searched for a gene of interest. APADB is the largest database of APA in human, chicken and mouse. The stored information provides experimental evidence for thousands of PA sites and APA events. APADB combines 3′ end sequencing data with prediction algorithms of miRNA binding sites, allowing to further improve prediction algorithms. Current databases lack correct information about 3′UTR lengths, especially for chicken, and APADB provides necessary information to close this gap.Database URL:http://tools.genxpro.net/apadb/	2.0	5	182	164	201	207	77	0.141754825733	0.133965905627	0.1168049629	0.109086813468	-0.220181343268	4.6872482658	-6.35555827772	NULL	2.91205940518	-7.93349878879

Many of these studies (such as effects of oxygen concentration, temperature stress, low pH stress, osmotic stress, depletion or limitation of nutrients, addition of different chemical compounds, etc.) have been conducted in the unicellular Eukaryal model, yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the lack of a unifying or integrated, bioinformatics platform that would permit efficient and rapid use of all these existing data remain an important issue. To facilitate research by exploiting existing transcription data in the field of yeast physiology, we have developed the yStreX database. It is an online repository of analyzed gene expression data from curated data sets from different studies that capture genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to diverse environmental transitions. The first aim of this online database is to facilitate comparison of cross-platform and cross-laboratory gene expression data. Additionally, we performed different expression analyses, meta-analyses and gene set enrichment analyses; and the results are also deposited in this database. Lastly, we constructed a user-friendly Web interface with interactive visualization to provide intuitive access and to display the queried data for users with no background in bioinformatics.Database URL:http://www.ystrexdb.com	1.0	5	185	236	240	41	129	0.277556919601	0.22470839532	0.193323443649	0.185347925094	-1.6876861847	3.04197272538	-1.52028996433	NULL	1.72855847037	-4.01796386166

Hence, semi-automatic tools can be a valid support to increase annotation throughput. Although a handful of curation assistant tools are already available, to date, little has been done to formally evaluate their benefit to biocuration. Moreover, most curation tools are designed for specific problems. Thus, it is not easy to apply an annotation tool for multiple tasks. BioQRator is a publicly available web-based tool for annotating biomedical literature. It was designed to support general tasks, i.e. any task annotating entities and relationships. In the BioCreative IV edition, BioQRator was tailored for protein– protein interaction (PPI) annotation by migrating information from PIEthe search. The results obtained from six curators showed that the precision on the top 10 documents doubled with PIEthe searchcompared with PubMed search results. It was also observed that the annotation time for a full PPI annotation task decreased for a beginner-intermediate level annotator. This finding is encouraging because text-mining techniques were not directly involved in the full annotation task and BioQRator can be easily integrated with any text-mining resources.Database URL:http://www.bioqrator.org/	2.0	4	186	192	266	33	255	0.297609698853	0.214391831404	0.213636240172	0.198981657537	4.27028512246	0.762359816768	2.65890595609	NULL	7.28688772502	2.08347506636

The IFIM database currently contains data from 16 experiments and 2186 theoretical predictions. The highly significant correlation between the experiment-derived fitness data and our computational simulations demonstrated that the computer-generated predictions were often as reliable as the experimental data. The data in IFIM can be accessed easily, and the interface allows users to browse through the gene fitness information that it contains.

Interactive annotation tools intend to fill this gap, taking advantage of automatic techniques and existing knowledge bases to assist expert curators in their daily tasks. This article presents Egas, a web-based platform for biomedical text mining and assisted curation with highly usable interfaces for manual and automatic in-line annotation of concepts and relations. A comprehensive set of de facto standard knowledge bases are integrated and indexed to provide straightforward concept normalization features. Real-time collaboration and conversation functionalities allow discussing details of the annotation task as well as providing instant feedback of curator’s interactions. Egas also provides interfaces for on-demand management of the annotation task settings and guidelines, and supports standard formats and literature services to import and export documents. By taking advantage of Egas, we participated in the BioCreative IV interactive annotation task, targeting the assisted identification of protein–protein interactions described in PubMed abstracts related to neuropathological disorders. When evaluated by expert curators, it obtained positive scores in terms of usability, reliability and performance.

We present the miRror-Suite platform, developed to yield a robust and concise explanation for miRNA regulation from a large collection of differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs. The miRror-Suite platform includes the miRror2.0 and Probability Supported Iterative miRror (PSI-miRror) tools. Researchers who performed large-scale transcriptomics or miRNA profiling experiments from cells and tissues will benefit from miRror-Suite. Our platform provides a concise, plausible explanation for the regulation of miRNAs in such complex settings. The input for miRror2.0 may include hundreds of differentially expressed genes or miRNAs. In the case of miRNAs as input, the algorithm seeks the statistically most likely set of genes regulated by this input. Alternatively, for a set of genes, the miRror algorithm seeks a collection of miRNAs that best explains their regulation. The miRror-Suite algorithm designates statistical criteria that were uniformly applied to a dozen miRNA-target prediction databases. Users select the preferred databases for predictions and numerous optional filters/parameters that restrict the search to the desired tissues, cell lines, level of expression and predictor scores. PSI-miRror is an advanced application for refining the input set by gradually enhancing the degree of pairing of the sets of miRNAs with the sets of targets. The iterations of PSI-miRror probe the interlinked nature of miRNAs and targets within cells. miRror-Suite serves experimentalists in facilitating the understanding of miRNA regulation through combinatorial– cooperative activity.

The abundance of predictedcis-sequences is a major challenge to associate these sequences with a possible function in gene expression regulation. To identify a possible function of the predictedcis-sequences, a novel web tool designated ‘in silicoexpression analysis’ was developed that correlates submittedcis-sequences with gene expression data fromArabidopsis thaliana. The web tool identifies theA. thalianagenes harbouring the sequence in a defined promoter region and compares the expression of these genes with microarray data. The result is a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic stress conditions to which these genes are most likely responsive.

Discerning different components that contribute toward a favorable protein– ligand interaction could contribute significantly toward better understanding protein function, rationalizing drug design and obtaining design principles for protein engineering. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) currently hosts the structure of ∼68 000 protein–ligand complexes. Although several databases exist that classify proteins according to sequence and structure, a mere handful of them annotate and classify protein–ligand interactions and provide information on different attributes of molecular recognition. In this study, an exhaustive comparison of all the biologically relevant ligand-binding sites (84 846 sites) has been conducted using PocketMatch: a rapid, parallel, in-house algorithm. PocketMatch quantifies the similarity between binding sites based on structural descriptors and residue attributes. A similarity network was constructed using binding sites whose PocketMatch scores exceeded a high similarity threshold (0.80). The binding site similarity network was clustered into discrete sets of similar sites using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm. Furthermore, various computational tools have been used to study different attributes of interactions within the individual clusters. The attributes can be roughly divided into (i) binding site characteristics including pocket shape, nature of residues and interaction profiles with different kinds of atomic probes, (ii) atomic contacts consisting of various types of polar, hydrophobic and aromatic contacts along with binding site water molecules that could play crucial roles in protein–ligand interactions and (iii) binding energetics involved in interactions derived from scoring functions developed for docking. For each ligand-binding site in each protein in the PDB, site similarity information, clusters they belong to and description of site attributes are provided as a relational database—protein–ligand interaction clusters (PLIC).Database URL:http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/PLIC	1.0	5	201	84	87	151	74	0.224395510606	0.193103364463	0.192295716048	0.186819689077	2.58684393324	-3.70509644149	-1.31434915285	NULL	-1.55754852948	5.4165085109

One method of achieving this is collecting data in a central repository or in a location that is part of a federated system and providing interfaces to the data. However, certain data, such as data from biobanks or clinical studies, may, for legal and privacy reasons, often not be stored in public repositories. Instead, we describe a metadata cataloguing system and a software suite for reporting the presence of data from the life sciences domain. The system stores three types of metadata: file information, file provenance and data lineage, and content descriptions. Our software suite includes both graphical and command line interfaces that allow users to report and tag files with these different metadata types. Importantly, the files remain in their original locations with their existing access-control mechanisms in place, while our system provides descriptions of their contents and relationships.

Selection of a single representative sequence for each family provides targets for structure determination or modeling and also enables fast sequence searches to associate new members to a family. Such a selection could be challenging since some of these domain families exhibit huge variation depending on the number of members in the family, the average family sequence length or the extent of sequence divergence within a family. We had earlier created 3PFDB database as a repository of best representative sequences, selected from each PFAM domain family on the basis of high coverage. In this study, we have improved the database using more efficient strategies for the initial generation of sequence profiles and implement two independent methods, FASSM and HMMER, for identifying family members. HMMER employs a global sequence similarity search, while FASSM relies on motif identification and matching. This improved and updated database, 3PFDB+ generated in this study, provides representative sequences and profiles for PFAM families, with 13 519 family representatives having more than 90% family coverage. The representative sequence is also highlighted in a two-dimensional plot, which reflects the relative divergence between family members. Representatives belonging to small families with short sequences are mainly associated with low coverage. The set of sequences not recognized by the family representative profiles, highlight several potential false or weak family associations in PFAM. Partial domains and fragments dominate such cases, along with sequences that are highly diverged or different from other family members. Some of these outliers were also predicted to have different secondary structure contents, which reflect different putative structure or functional roles for these domain sequences.Database URL:http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdbplus/	1.0	4	203	160	267	181	119	0.261654034141	0.207951159095	0.16374304657	0.156800990011	0.74823345754	-3.71479633951	3.69465514202	NULL	-0.865417836202	3.43701155907

The development of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has resulted in a rapid increase of PTMs identified on proteins from different species. The collection and systematic ordering of PTM data should provide invaluable information for understanding cellular processes and signaling pathways regulated by PTMs. For this original purpose we developed SysPTM, a systematic resource installed with comprehensive PTM data and a suite of web tools for annotation of PTMs in 2009. Four years later, there has been a significant advance with the generation of PTM data and, consequently, more sophisticated analysis requirements have to be met.

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that epigenetics and miRNA can affect each other in various ways. In this study, we established the EpimiR database, which collects 1974 regulations between 19 kinds of epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, H3K4me3, H3S10p) and 617 miRNAs across seven species (includingHomo sapiens,Mus musculus,Rattus norvegicus,Gallus gallus, Epstein–Barr virus,Canis familiarisandArabidopsis thaliana) from >300 references in the literature. These regulations can be divided into two parts: miR2Epi (103 entries describing how miRNA regulates epigenetic modification) and Epi2miR (1871 entries describing how epigenetic modification affects miRNA). Each entry of EpimiR not only contains basic descriptions of the validated experiment (method, species, reference and so on) but also clearly illuminates the regulatory pathway between epigenetics and miRNA. As a supplement to the curated information, the EpimiR extends to gather predicted epigenetic features (such as predicted transcription start site, upstream CpG island) associated with miRNA for users to guide their future biological experiments. Finally, EpimiR offers download and submission pages.

To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers >4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding.

It is needed to understand the impact of mutations on phenotypes, to shed light on genetic and epigenetic regulation of mRNAs and more generally to widen our knowledge about cell functionality and tissue diversity. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the other applications of the next-generation sequencing, provides precious data to improve annotations' accuracy, simultaneously creating issues related to the variety, complexity and the size of produced data. In this ‘scenario’, the lack of user-friendly resources, easily accessible to researchers with low skills in bioinformatics, makes difficult to retrieve complete information about one or few genes without browsing a jungle of databases. Concordantly, the increasing amount of data from ‘omics’ technologies imposes to develop integrated databases merging different data formats coming from distinct but complementary sources. In light of these considerations, and given the wide interest in studying Down syndrome—a genetic condition due to the trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21)—we developed an integrated relational database and a web interface, named ALE-HSA21 (AnaLysis of Expression on HSA21), accessible athttp://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21.

Furthermore, integration of information such as agroecological farming system characteristics can provide new knowledge on risk factors of influenza emergence and spread. Integrating viral characteristics into an animal disease information system is therefore expected to provide a unique tool to trace-and-track particular virus strains; generate clade distributions and spatiotemporal clusters; screen for distribution of viruses with specific molecular markers; identify potential risk factors; and analyze or map viral characteristics related to vaccines used for control and/or prevention. For this purpose, a genetic module was developed within EMPRES-i (FAO’s global animal disease information system) linking epidemiological information from influenza events with virus characteristics and enabling combined analysis. An algorithm was developed to act as the interface between EMPRES-i disease event data and publicly available influenza virus sequences in OpenfluDB. This algorithm automatically computes potential links between outbreak event and sequences, which are subsequently manually validated by experts. Subsequently, other virus characteristics such as antiviral resistance can then be associated to outbreak data. To visualize such characteristics on a geographic map, shape files with virus characteristics to overlay on other EMPRES-i map layers (e.g. animal densities) can be generated. The genetic module allows export of associated epidemiological and sequence data for further analysis. FAO has made this tool available for scientists and policy makers.

Bisulfite sequencing enables profiling of mouse developmental methylomes on an unprecedented scale; however, integrating and mining these data are challenges for experimental biologists. Therefore, we developed DevMouse, which focuses on the efficient storage of DNA methylomes in temporal order and quantitative analysis of methylation dynamics during mouse development. The latest release of DevMouse incorporates 32 normalized and temporally ordered methylomes across 15 developmental stages and related genome information. A flexible query engine is developed for acquisition of methylation profiles for genes, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and genomic intervals of interest across selected developmental stages. To facilitate in-depth mining of these profiles, DevMouse offers online analysis tools for the quantification of methylation variation, identification of differentially methylated genes, hierarchical clustering, gene function annotation and enrichment. Moreover, a configurable MethyBrowser is provided to view the base-resolution methylomes under a genomic context. In brief, DevMouse hosts comprehensive mouse developmental methylome data and provides online tools to explore the relationships of DNA methylation and development.Database URL:http://www.devmouse.org/	1.0	4	217	98	178	130	37	0.145612904201	0.127947328222	0.101048151729	0.0871125097631	-1.76541171103	-1.29737040055	-2.08890231134	NULL	1.86011528423	-1.50257721796

Tuberculosis is a disease with high morbidity and mortality, especially in the third world. The genetic variability between clinical isolates of MTBC has been poorly understood, although recent years have seen the re-sequencing of a large number of clinical isolates of MTBC from around the world. The availability of genomic data of multiple isolates in public domain would potentially offer a unique opportunity toward understanding the variome of the organism and the functional consequences of the variations. This nevertheless has been limited by the lack of systematic curation and analysis of data sets available in public domain. In this report, we have re-analyzed re-sequencing data sets corresponding to >450 isolates of MTBC available in public domain to create a comprehensive variome map of MTBC comprising >29 000 single nucleotide variations. Using a systematic computational pipeline, we have annotated potential functional variants and drug-resistance-associated variants from the variome. We have made available this data set as a searchable database. Apart from a user-friendly interface, the database also has a novel option to annotate variants from clinical re-sequencing data sets of MTBC.

A number of specialized databases have been designed to manage huge data sets from HIV cohort, vaccine, host genomic and drug resistance studies. Besides databases from cohort studies, most of the online databases contain limited curated data and are thus sequence repositories. HIV drug resistance has been shown to have a great potential to derail the progress made thus far through antiretroviral therapy. Thus, a lot of resources have been invested in generating drug resistance data for patient management and surveillance purposes. Unfortunately, most of the data currently available relate to subtype B even though >60% of the epidemic is caused by HIV-1 subtype C. A consortium of clinicians, scientists, public health experts and policy markers working in southern Africa came together and formed a network, the Southern African Treatment and Resistance Network (SATuRN), with the aim of increasing curated HIV-1 subtype C and tuberculosis drug resistance data. This article describes the HIV-1 data curation process using the SATuRN Rega database. The data curation is a manual and time-consuming process done by clinical, laboratory and data curation specialists. Access to the highly curated data sets is through applications that are reviewed by the SATuRN executive committee. Examples of research outputs from the analysis of the curated data include trends in the level of transmitted drug resistance in South Africa, analysis of the levels of acquired resistance among patients failing therapy and factors associated with the absence of genotypic evidence of drug resistance among patients failing therapy. All these studies have been important for informing first- and second-line therapy.

These valuable data are scattered, and there have been no systematic attempts to document the various proteins regulated by hypoxia. Compilation, curation and annotation of these data are important in deciphering their role in hypoxia and hypoxia-related disorders. Therefore, we have compiled HypoxiaDB, a database of hypoxia-regulated proteins. It is a comprehensive, manually-curated, non-redundant catalog of proteins whose expressions are shown experimentally to be altered at different levels and durations of hypoxia. The database currently contains 72 000 manually curated entries taken on 3500 proteins extracted from 73 peer-reviewed publications selected from PubMed. HypoxiaDB is distinctive from other generalized databases: (i) it compiles tissue-specific protein expression changes under different levels and duration of hypoxia. Also, it provides manually curated literature references to support the inclusion of the protein in the database and establish its association with hypoxia. (ii) For each protein, HypoxiaDB integrates data on gene ontology, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway, protein–protein interactions, protein family (Pfam), OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), PDB (Protein Data Bank) structures and homology to other sequenced genomes. (iii) It also provides pre-compiled information on hypoxia-proteins, which otherwise requires tedious computational analysis. This includes information like chromosomal location, identifiers like Entrez, HGNC, Unigene, Uniprot, Ensembl, Vega, GI numbers and Genbank accession numbers associated with the protein. These are further cross-linked to respective public databases augmenting HypoxiaDB to the external repositories. (iv) In addition, HypoxiaDB provides an online sequence-similarity search tool for users to compare their protein sequences with HypoxiaDB protein database. We hope that HypoxiaDB will enrich our knowledge about hypoxia-related biology and eventually will lead to the development of novel hypothesis and advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic activities.

237	http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/	238	NULL	PSI-MI	The complex biological processes that control cellular function are mediated by intricate networks of molecular interactions. Accumulating evidence indicates that these interactions are often interdependent, thus acting cooperatively. Cooperative interactions are prevalent in and indispensible for reliable and robust control of cell regulation, as they underlie the conditional decision-making capability of large regulatory complexes. Despite an increased focus on experimental elucidation of the molecular details of cooperative binding events, as evidenced by their growing occurrence in literature, they are currently lacking from the main bioinformatics resources. One of the contributing factors to this deficiency is the lack of a computer-readable standard representation and exchange format for cooperative interaction data. To tackle this shortcoming, we added functionality to the widely used PSI-MI interchange format for molecular interaction data by defining new controlled vocabulary terms that allow annotation of different aspects of cooperativity without making structural changes to the underlying XML schema. As a result, we are able to capture cooperative interaction data in a structured format that is backward compatible with PSI-MI–based data and applications. This will facilitate the storage, exchange and analysis of cooperative interaction data, which in turn will advance experimental research on this fundamental principle in biology.Database URL:http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/	0.0	4	224	48	277	89	28	0.21598663692	0.163844054918	0.141257176425	0.136019848569	-2.51365593174	-0.692915512497	-6.00803983294	NULL	1.81550384714	3.24120970797

248	http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/	249	NULL	CARLSBAD	Many bioactivity databases offer information regarding the biological activity of small molecules on protein targets. Information in these databases is often hard to resolve with certainty because of subsetting different data in a variety of formats; use of different bioactivity metrics; use of different identifiers for chemicals and proteins; and having to access different query interfaces, respectively. Given the multitude of data sources, interfaces and standards, it is challenging to gather relevant facts and make appropriate connections and decisions regarding chemical–protein associations. The CARLSBAD database has been developed as an integrated resource, focused on high-quality subsets from several bioactivity databases, which are aggregated and presented in a uniform manner, suitable for the study of the relationships between small molecules and targets. In contrast to data collection resources, CARLSBAD provides a single normalized activity value of a given type for each unique chemical–protein target pair. Two types of scaffold perception methods have been implemented and are available for datamining: HierS (hierarchical scaffolds) and MCES (maximum common edge subgraph). The 2012 release of CARLSBAD contains 439 985 unique chemical structures, mapped onto 1,420 889 unique bioactivities, and annotated with 277 140 HierS scaffolds and 54 135 MCES chemical patterns, respectively. Of the 890 323 unique structure–target pairs curated in CARLSBAD, 13.95% are aggregated from multiple structure–target values: 94 975 are aggregated from two bioactivities, 14 544 from three, 7 930 from four and 2214 have five bioactivities, respectively. CARLSBAD captures bioactivities and tags for 1435 unique chemical structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e. ‘drugs’). CARLSBAD processing resulted in a net 17.3% data reduction for chemicals, 34.3% reduction for bioactivities, 23% reduction for HierS and 25% reduction for MCES, respectively. The CARLSBAD database supports a knowledge mining system that provides non-specialists with novel integrative ways of exploring chemical biology space to facilitate knowledge mining in drug discovery and repurposing.Database URL:http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/.	1.0	5	234	90	69	188	84	0.157649441481	0.152739229142	0.113144460779	0.112627880767	4.29451128548	-4.99495439703	0.738130742013	NULL	-4.07993315729	6.13907102935

Mutation carriers are at high risk for developing early-onset colorectal and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Consensus clinical guidelines have been proposed, allowing the efficient detection of curable lesions. The major challenge of genetic testing is to reliably classify the genomic variations in those patients who seek genetic counseling.

Because the MHC is subject to extensive variation, both structural and sequence-wise, it is not readily amenable to study in whole genome shotgun sequence such as the recently published gorilla genome. The variation of the MHC also makes it of evolutionary interest and therefore we analyse the sequence in the context of human and chimpanzee. In our comparisons with human and re-annotated chimpanzee MHC sequence we find that gorilla has a trimodular RCCX cluster, versus the reference human bimodular cluster, and additional copies of Class I (pseudo)genes betweenGogo-KandGogo-A(the orthologues ofHLA-Kand-A).

In flies and mice, the pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that regulate protein-coding genes through the RNAi pathway. Following these findings, we construct an innovative and comprehensive database to elucidate siRNA-mediated mechanism in human transcribed pseudogenes (TPGs). To investigate TPG producing siRNAs that regulate protein-coding genes, we mapped the TPGs to small RNAs (sRNAs) that were supported by publicly deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries and constructed the TPG-derived siRNA-target interactions.

The Text-mined Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes candidate gene database (T-HOD) is developed to help trace existing research on three kinds of cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, obesity and diabetes, with the last disease categorized into Type 1 and Type 2, by regularly and semiautomatically extracting HOD-related genes from newly published literature. Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease–gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein–protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts. The interface of T-HOD facilitates easy browsing for users and allows T-HOD curators to verify data efficiently. We believe that T-HOD can help life scientists in search for more disease candidate genes in a less time- and effort-consuming manner.Database URL:http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/THOD	2.0	4	251	241	72	83	226	0.159394079426	0.156681836786	0.135582623294	0.130888662122	3.59687307786	3.84985128265	-1.95845162788	NULL	7.97890886962	-1.93488384331

In this study, we develop a new module called ‘correlation module’, which includes three kinds of gene expression correlation analyses. The first one computes correlation coefficient between 2 or more (up to 10) chosen genes. The second one produces two lists of genes that are most correlated (positively and negatively) to a ‘tested’ gene. A gene ontology (GO) mining function is also proposed to explore GO ‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’ terms enrichment for the output lists of most correlated genes. The third one explores gene expression correlation between the 15 telomeric and 15 centromeric genes surrounding a ‘tested’ gene. These correlation analyses can be performed in different groups of patients: all patients (without any subtyping), in molecular subtypes (basal-like, HER2+, luminal A and luminal B) and according to oestrogen receptor status. Validation tests based on published data showed that these automatized analyses lead to results consistent with studies’ conclusions. In brief, this new module has been developed to help basic researchers explore molecular mechanisms of breast cancer.Database URL:http://bcgenex.centregauducheau.fr	3.0	4	252	147	258	1	244	0.166152623277	0.137034545039	0.122651068542	0.117213614413	1.97517367977	5.29342972004	-0.630899282317	NULL	5.49694341414	-1.58494532478

Past research has suggested that computer-assisted curation can improve efficiency, but few text-mining systems have been formally evaluated in this regard. Through participation in the interactive text-mining track of the BioCreative 2012 workshop, we developed PubTator, a PubMed-like system that assists with two specific human curation tasks: document triage and bioconcept annotation. On the basis of evaluation results from two external user groups, we find that the accuracy of PubTator-assisted curation is comparable with that of manual curation and that PubTator can significantly increase human curatorial speed.

277	http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/	278	NULL	AgBase	AgBase provides annotation for agricultural gene products using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Plant Ontology, as appropriate. Unlike model organism species, agricultural species have a body of literature that does not just focus on gene function; to improve efficiency, we use text mining to identify literature for curation. The first component of our annotation interface is the gene prioritization interface that ranks gene products for annotation. Biocurators select the top-ranked gene and mark annotation for these genes as ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’; links enable biocurators to move directly to our biocuration interface (BI). Our BI includes all current GO annotation for gene products and is the main interface to add/modify AgBase curation data. The BI also displays Extracting Genic Information from Text (eGIFT) results for each gene product. eGIFT is a web-based, text-mining tool that associates ranked, informative terms (iTerms) and the articles and sentences containing them, with genes. Moreover, iTerms are linked to GO terms, where they match either a GO term name or a synonym. This enables AgBase biocurators to rapidly identify literature for further curation based on possible GO terms. Because most agricultural species do not have standardized literature, eGIFT searches all gene names and synonyms to associate articles with genes. As many of the gene names can be ambiguous, eGIFT applies a disambiguation step to remove matches that do not correspond to this gene, and filtering is applied to remove abstracts that mention a gene in passing. The BI is linked to our Journal Database (JDB) where corresponding journal citations are stored. Just as importantly, biocurators also add to the JDB citations that have no GO annotation. The AgBase BI also supports bulk annotation upload to facilitate our Inferred from electronic annotation of agricultural gene products. All annotations must pass standard GO Consortium quality checking before release in AgBase.Database URL:http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/	1.0	4	258	1	293	198	252	0.263237475901	0.206439553714	0.155900089886	0.137034545039	2.10372352245	-0.423871882724	-0.925251824364	NULL	5.88920765653	-3.20784915392

In past, cell penetrating peptides have been successfully used for delivering a wide variety of therapeutic molecules into various types of cells for the treatment of multiple diseases. These peptides have unique ability to gain access to the interior of almost any type of cell. Due to the huge therapeutic applications of CPPs, we have built a comprehensive database ‘CPPsite’, of cell penetrating peptides, where information is compiled from the literature and patents. CPPsite is a manually curated database of experimentally validated 843 CPPs. Each entry provides information of a peptide that includes ID, PubMed ID, peptide name, peptide sequence, chirality, origin, nature of peptide, sub-cellular localization, uptake efficiency, uptake mechanism, hydrophobicity, amino acid frequency and composition, etc. A wide range of user-friendly tools have been incorporated in this database like searching, browsing, analyzing, mapping tools. In addition, we have derived various types of information from these peptide sequences that include secondary/tertiary structure, amino acid composition and physicochemical properties of peptides. This database will be very useful for developing models for predicting effective cell penetrating peptides.Database URL:http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/.	8.0	5	269	191	31	167	100	0.489861639084	0.299150998134	0.282060230548	0.214912608977	3.14951712919	-3.65301142018	5.19246410267	NULL	-7.67924172475	4.44268726408

The CCDS data set reflects a ‘gold standard’ definition of best supported protein annotations, and corresponding genes, which pass a standard series of quality assurance checks and are supported by manual curation. This data set supports use of genome annotation information by human and mouse researchers for effective experimental design, analysis and interpretation. The CCDS project consists of analysis of automated whole-genome annotation builds to identify identical CDS annotations, quality assurance testing and manual curation support. Identical CDS annotations are tracked with a CCDS identifier (ID) and any future change to the annotated CDS structure must be agreed upon by the collaborating members. CCDS curation guidelines were developed to address some aspects of curation in order to improve initial annotation consistency and to reduce time spent in discussing proposed annotation updates. Here, we present the current status of the CCDS database and details on our procedures to track and coordinate our efforts. We also present the relevant background and reasoning behind the curation standards that we have developed for CCDS database treatment of transcripts that are nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) candidates, for transcripts containing upstream open reading frames, for identifying the most likely translation start codons and for the annotation of readthrough transcripts.

Nonetheless, since the success of the GWAS approach varies widely, the identification of genetic variants for complex diseases remains a difficult problem. We developed a novel bioinformatics approach to identify the nominal genetic variants associated with complex diseases. To test the feasibility of our approach, we developed a web-based aggregation tool to organize the genes, genetic variations and pathways involved in preterm birth. We used semantic data mining to extract all published articles related to preterm birth. All articles were reviewed by a team of curators. Genes identified from public databases and archives of expression arrays were aggregated with genes curated from the literature. Pathway analysis was used to impute genes from pathways identified in the curations. The curated articles and collected genetic information form a unique resource for investigators interested in preterm birth.

This phenomenon is observed in an array of protein structures in oligomeric conformation. Protein structures in swapped conformations perform diverse functional roles and are also associated with deposition diseases in humans. We have performed in-depth literature curation and structural bioinformatics analyses to develop an integrated knowledgebase of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. The hallmark of 3D domain swapping is the presence of distinct structural segments such as the hinge and swapped regions. We have curated the literature to delineate the boundaries of these regions. In addition, we have defined several new concepts like ‘secondary major interface’ to represent the interface properties arising as a result of 3D domain swapping, and a new quantitative measure for the ‘extent of swapping’ in structures. The catalog of proteins reported in 3DSwap knowledgebase has been generated using an integrated structural bioinformatics workflow of database searches, literature curation, by structure visualization and sequence–structure–function analyses.

By non-redundant, we mean that the accounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each independent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less. While many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them contains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition, the annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often disagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while consolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including interactions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein nomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in comprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all information/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform additional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals. Another issue has to do with protein complexes. Some databases represent experimentally observed complexes as interactions with more than two participants, while others expand them into binary interactions using spoke or matrix model. To avoid untested interaction information buildup, it is preferable to replace the expanded protein complexes, either from spoke or matrix models, with a flat list of complex members.To address these issues and to achieve our goals, we have developed ppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant, consistently annotated data sets of physical interactions. Our script proceeds in three stages: mapping all interactants to gene identifiers and removing all undesired raw interactions, deflating potentially expanded complexes, and reconciling for each interaction the annotation labels among different source databases. As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal data sets: yeast, human and fruitfly. While ppiTrim can resolve most apparent conflicts between different labelings, we also discovered some unresolvable disagreements mostly resulting from different annotation policies among repositories.Database URL:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/ppiTrim.html	1.0	4	277	224	148	89	84	0.163844054918	0.163538947062	0.160397923914	0.144401377377	0.543553094848	-4.43916772479	-3.8733892216	NULL	1.82183505218	3.62939895479

CycADS is centred on a specific database model and on a set of Java programs to import, filter and export relevant information. Data from GenBank and other annotation sources (including for example: KAAS, PRIAM, Blast2GO and PhylomeDB) are collected into a database to be subsequently filtered and extracted to generate a complete annotation file. This file is then used to build an enriched BioCyc database using the PathoLogic program of Pathway Tools.

The ability to generate this data has become easier over recent years and the rate of data production is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. One major problem associated with this vast amount of data is how to store it in a way that it can be easily retrieved at a later date. The obvious answer to this problem is a database. However, a key issue in the development and maintenance of such a database is its sustainability, which in turn depends on the ease of the deposition and retrieval process. Encouraging users to care about meta-data is difficult and thus the success of any storage system will ultimately depend on how well used by end-users the system is.

We discuss here, a simple database system which we call ‘Bookshelf’, that uses python in conjunction with a mysql database to provide an extremely simple system for curating and keeping track of molecular simulation data.

In PDBj Mine, data are loaded from files in the PDBMLplus format (an extension of PDBML, PDB's canonical XML format, enriched with annotations), which are then served for the user of PDBj via the worldwide web (WWW). We describe the basic design of the relational database (RDB) and web interfaces of PDBj Mine. The contents of PDBMLplus files are first broken into XPath entities, and these paths and data are indexed in the way that reflects the hierarchical structure of the XML files. The data for each XPath type are saved into the corresponding relational table that is named as the XPath itself. The generation of table definitions from the PDBMLplus XML schema is fully automated. For efficient search, frequently queried terms are compiled into a brief summary table. Casual users can perform simple keyword search, and 'Advanced Search' which can specify various conditions on the entries. More experienced users can query the database using SQL statements which can be constructed in a uniform manner. Thus, PDBj Mine achieves a combination of the flexibility of XML documents and the robustness of the RDB.Database URL:http://www.pdbj.org/	0.0	4	289	202	52	268	226	0.0948100389872	0.0932596623669	0.08350857496	0.0764735423396	-2.49783913785	-5.73949581583	-0.992187461712	NULL	-4.51089514107	1.86567900617

They play a crucial role in the communication of a cell with the environment. Ligands bind to GPCRs on the outside of the cell, activating them by causing a conformational change, and allowing them to bind to G-proteins. Through their interaction with G-proteins, several effector molecules are activated leading to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. The great importance of GPCRs and their corresponding signal transduction pathways is indicated by the fact that they take part in many diverse disease processes and that a large part of efforts towards drug development today is focused on them. We present Human-gpDB, a database which currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-proteins and 99 human effectors. The collection of information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current version of Human-gpDB holds information for about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-proteins and 1618 connections between G-proteins and effectors. Major advantages of Human-gpDB are the integration of several external data sources and the support of advanced visualization techniques. Human-gpDB is a simple, yet a powerful tool for researchers in the life sciences field as it integrates an up-to-date, carefully curated collection of human GPCRs, G-proteins, effectors and their interactions.

Currently, there are several such ‘science-wikis’ that aim to collect specialist knowledge from the community into centralized resources. However, there is no consensus about how to achieve this goal. For example, it is not clear how to best integrate data from established, centralized databases with that provided by ‘community annotation’. We created PDBWiki, a scientific wiki for the community annotation of protein structures. The wiki consists of one structured page for each entry in the the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and allows the user to attach categorized comments to the entries. Additionally, each page includes a user editable list of cross-references to external resources. As in a database, it is possible to produce tabular reports and ‘structure galleries’ based on user-defined queries or lists of entries. PDBWiki runs in parallel to the PDB, separating original database content from user annotations. PDBWiki demonstrates how collaboration features can be integrated with primary data from a biological database. It can be used as a system for better understanding how to capture community knowledge in the biological sciences. For users of the PDB, PDBWiki provides a bug-tracker, discussion forum and community annotation system. To date, user participation has been modest, but is increasing.

Associating existing functional annotation of orthologs can speed up the annotation process and even examine the existing annotation. However, current protein sequence-based ortholog databases provide ambiguous and incomplete orthology in eukaryotes. It is because that isoforms, derived by alternative splicing (AS), often share higher sequence similarity to interfere the sequence-based identification. Gene-Oriented Ortholog Database (GOOD) employs genomic locations of transcripts to cluster AS-derived isoforms prior to ortholog delineation to eliminate the interference from AS. From the gene-oriented presentation, isoforms can be clearly associated to their genes to provide comprehensive ortholog information and further be discriminated from paralogs. Aside from, displaying clusters of isoforms between orthologous genes can present the evolution variation at the transcription level. Based on orthology, GOOD additionally comprises functional annotation from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. However, there exist redundant annotations, both parent and child terms assigned to the same gene, in the GO database. It is difficult to precisely draw the numerical comparison of term counts between orthologous genes annotated with redundant terms. Instead of the description only, GOOD further provides the GO graphs to reveal hierarchical-like relationships among divergent functionalities. Therefore, the redundancy of GO terms can be examined, and the context among compared terms is more comprehensive. In sum, GOOD can improve the interpretation in the molecular function from experiments in the model organism and provide clear comparative genomic annotation across organisms.Database URL:http://goods.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/goods/	0.0	4	293	130	258	1	243	0.21575536921	0.206439553714	0.20328830638	0.178059819631	0.664136913424	-0.471848061537	-0.761883219453	NULL	4.96972295758	-3.43460370848

In order to systematically document and integrate these various data types, we have developed a database of experimentally verifiedin vivophosphorylation sites curated from theS. cerevisiaeprimary literature. PhosphoGRID (www.phosphogrid.org) records the positions of over 5000 specific phosphorylated residues on 1495 gene products. Nearly 900 phosphorylated residues are reported from detailed studies of individual proteins; thesein vivophosphorylation sites are documented by a hierarchy of experimental evidence codes. Where available for specific sites, we have also noted the relevant protein kinases and/or phosphatases, the specific condition(s) under which phosphorylation occurs, and the effect(s) that phosphorylation has on protein function. The unique features of PhosphoGRID that assign both function and specific physiological conditions to each phosphorylated residue will provide a valuable benchmark for proteome-level studies and will facilitate bioinformatic analysis of cellular signal transduction networks.Database URL:http://phosphogrid.org/	3.0	4	294	161	138	179	146	0.324077174462	0.298243327374	0.279859484547	0.248395929972	6.95980176717	-2.55128971227	-1.44055217318	NULL	4.2467791049	6.40182708135

However, no such database is specifically focused on foods and more precisely on polyphenols, one of the major classes of phytochemicals. As antoxidants, polyphenols influence human health and may play a role in the prevention of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, some cancers or type 2 diabetes. To determine polyphenol intake in populations and study their association with health, it is essential to have detailed information on their content in foods. However this information is not easily collected due to the variety of their chemical structures and the variability of their content in a given food. Phenol-Explorer is the first comprehensive web-based database on polyphenol content in foods. It contains more than 37 000 original data points collected from 638 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of these data has been evaluated before they were aggregated to produce final representative mean content values for 502 polyphenols in 452 foods. The web interface allows making various queries on the aggregated data to identify foods containing a given polyphenol or polyphenols present in a given food. For each mean content value, it is possible to trace all original content values and their literature sources. Phenol-Explorer is a major step forward in the development of databases on food constituents and the food metabolome. It should help researchers to better understand the role of phytochemicals in the technical and nutritional quality of food, and food manufacturers to develop tailor-made healthy foods.

High throughput studies have revealed several hundred proteins that are involved in the composition, function or biogenesis of cilia. The corresponding genes are potential candidates for orphan ciliopathies. To study ciliary genes, model organisms are used in which particular questions on motility, sensory or developmental functions can be approached by genetics. In the course of high throughput studies of cilia inParamecium tetraurelia, we were confronted with the problem of comparing our results with those obtained in other model organisms. We therefore developed a novel knowledgebase, Cildb, that integrates ciliary data from heterogeneous sources. Cildb links orthology relationships among 18 species to high throughput ciliary studies, and to OMIM data on human hereditary diseases. The web interface of Cildb comprises three tools, BioMart for complex queries, BLAST for sequence homology searches and GBrowse for browsing the human genome in relation to OMIM information for human diseases. Cildb can be used for interspecies comparisons, building candidate ciliary proteomes in any species, or identifying candidate ciliopathy genes.Database URL:http://cildb.cgm.cnrs-gif.fr	2.0	5	296	241	251	233	131	0.130728704753	0.101573339427	0.100342500003	0.0874665788373	4.55286582469	3.49364324036	-3.42926467837	NULL	8.40077090311	-3.29512427142

The role ofin silicosequence analysis is to assist biologists in the act of associating biological knowledge with these sequences, allowing investigators to make inferences and predictions that can be tested experimentally. A wide variety of software is available to the scientific community, and can be used to identify genomic objects, before predicting their biological functions. However, only a limited number of biologically interesting features can be revealed from an isolated sequence. Comparative genomics tools, on the other hand, by bringing together the information contained in numerous genomes simultaneously, allow annotators to make inferences based on the idea that evolution and natural selection are central to the definition of all biological processes. We have developed the MicroScope platform in order to offer a web-based framework for the systematic and efficient revision of microbial genome annotation and comparative analysis (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope). Starting with the description of the flow chart of the annotation processes implemented in the MicroScope pipeline, and the development of traditional and novel microbial annotation and comparative analysis tools, this article emphasizes the essential role of expert annotation as a complement of automatic annotation. Several examples illustrate the use of implemented tools for the review and curation of annotations of both new and publicly available microbial genomes within MicroScope’s rich integrated genome framework. The platform is used as a viewer in order to browse updated annotation information of available microbial genomes (more than 440 organisms to date), and in the context of new annotation projects (117 bacterial genomes). The human expertise gathered in the MicroScope database (about 280,000 independent annotations) contributes to improve the quality of microbial genome annotation, especially for genomes initially analyzed by automatic procedures alone.Database URLs:http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mageandhttp://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microcyc	6.0	5	297	283	54	190	113	0.17242965136	0.13629979377	0.135136266795	0.131877675778	-1.04197102639	-1.99244342907	2.16252755303	NULL	-5.91451298696	-2.25349744257

Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has classified ∼4379 virus species while the National Center for Biotechnology Information Viral Genomes Resource (NCBI-VGR) database has mapped 617 705 proteins to eight large taxonomic groups. Despite these efforts, an automated approach for mapping the ICTV master list and its officially accepted virus naming to the NCBI-VGR’s taxonomical classification is not available. Due to metagenomic sequencing, it is likely that the discovery and naming of new viral species will increase by at least ten fold. Unfortunately, existing viral databases are not adequately prepared to scale, maintain and annotate automatically ultra-high throughput sequences and place this information into specific taxonomic categories. ORION-VIRCAT is a scalable and interoperable object-relational database designed to serve as a resource for the integration and verification of taxonomical classifications generated by the ICTV and NCBI-VGR.

ORION-VIRCAT automatically mapped and joined 617 705 entries from the NCBI-VGR to the viral naming of the ICTV. This detailed analysis revealed that 399 095 entries from the NCBI-VGR can be mapped to the ICTV classification and that one Order, 10 families, 35 genera and 503 species listed in the ICTV disagree with the the NCBI-VGR classification schema.
