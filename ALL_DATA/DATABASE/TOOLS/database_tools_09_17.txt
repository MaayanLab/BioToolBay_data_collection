Huntley,David Binns,Emily Dimmer,Daniel Barrell,Claire O’Donovan,Rolf Apweiler	NULL	The Gene Ontology (GO) has proven to be a valuable resource for functional annotation of gene products. At well over 27 000 terms, the descriptiveness of GO has increased rapidly in line with the biological data it represents. Therefore, it is vital to be able to easily and quickly mine the functional information that has been made available through these GO terms being associated with gene products. QuickGO is a fast, web-based tool for browsing the GO and all associated GO annotations provided by the GOA group. After undergoing a redevelopment, QuickGO is now able to offer many more features beyond simple browsing. Users have responded well to the new tool and given very positive feedback about its usefulness. This tutorial will demonstrate how some of these features could be useful to the researcher wanting to discover more about their dataset, particular areas of biology or to find new ways of directing their research.Database URL:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO	2009-09-29	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300010&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/356393/QuickGO-a-user-tutorial-for-the-web-based-Gene	10.1093/database/bap010	18158299,19033274,16507094,16755502,18728045,18426554,16900125,15980438,19131956,18039703,18045787,18669619,18058819,18284697,18568404,19014467,19130232,19250922,17056297,18353293,19193869	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GProtein?ac=P04637,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.tools.browsers.shtml,http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/GO_form.shtml,http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/,http://gdm.fmrp.usp.br/cgi-bin/gc/upload/upload.pl,http://mcbc.usm.edu/gofetcher/home.php,http://mor.nlm.nih.gov/perl/gennav.pl,http://eagl.unige.ch/GOCat/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/ebimed/index.jsp,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/,http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/,http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.proteinatlas.org/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GAnnotation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GAnnotation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GAnnotation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/reference.html#advanced_annotation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GAnnotation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/tutorial.html,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/FAQs.html,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.tools.shtml	NULL	NULL	QuickGO	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO	NULL

McFarlane,Lee D. Larcombe	NULL	The identification of novel candidate markers is a key challenge in the development of cancer therapies. This can be facilitated by putting accessible and automated approaches analysing the current wealth of ‘omic’-scale data in the hands of researchers who are directly addressing biological questions. Data integration techniques and standardized, automated, high-throughput analyses are needed to manage the data available as well as to help narrow down the excessive number of target gene possibilities presented by modern databases and system-level resources. Here we present CancerMA, an online, integrated bioinformatic pipeline for automated identification of novel candidate cancer markers/targets; it operates by means of meta-analysing expression profiles of user-defined sets of biologically significant and related genes across a manually curated database of 80 publicly available cancer microarray datasets covering 13 cancer types. A simple-to-use web interface allows bioinformaticians and non-bioinformaticians alike to initiate new analyses as well as to view and retrieve the meta-analysis results. The functionality of CancerMA is shown by means of two validation datasets.Database URL:http://www.cancerma.org.uk	2012-12-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316115700001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/440957/CancerMA-a-web-based-tool-for-automatic-meta	10.1093/database/bas055	15286780,21071405,21097893,14550631,20678237,10070677,21624134,21470421,22918178,16076888,12490442,14960456,20929869,21044364,21605215,17098774,19541911,11408310,15461798,15036884,11358798,16489176,10945597,22064247,12670919,19903768,15249585,11923519,19771275,15172991,19962668,15095482,17651921,20730571,15578711,14581349,8094291,15305371,11103784,14996741,17211480,18483093,15578687,15558012,11099028,20698961,17932051,17356713,22782548,18803840,19956698,19628502,16982708,17900369	http://www.cancerma.org.uk,http://www.cancerma.org.uk/information.html,http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/annotationfilesmain.affx,http://www.cancerma.org.uk,http://www.mysql.com,http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/,http://jquery.com/,http://www.perl.org,http://www.cran.r-project.org,http://www.bioconductor.org,http://www.perl.org,http://www.cancerma.org.uk,http://www.cancerma.org.uk/help.html,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	CancerMA	http://www.cancerma.org.uk	NULL

Single-target drugs may not always produce desired physiological effects on the entire biological system, even if they have successfully regulated the activities of their designated targets. On the other hand, multicomponent therapy, in which two or more agents simultaneously interact with multiple targets, has attracted growing attention. Many drug combinations consisting of multiple agents have already entered clinical practice, especially in treating complex and refractory diseases. Drug combination database (DCDB), launched in 2010, is the first available database that collects and organizes information on drug combinations, with an aim to facilitate systems-oriented new drug discovery. Here, we report the second major release of DCDB (Version 2.0), which includes 866 new drug combinations (1363 in total), consisting of 904 distinctive components. These drug combinations are curated from ∼140 000 clinical studies and the food and drug administration (FDA) electronic orange book. In this update, DCDB collects 237 unsuccessful drug combinations, which may provide a contrast for systematic discovery of the patterns in successful drug combinations.Database URL:http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/dcdb/	2014-12-23	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000346841100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635579/DCDB-2-0-a-major-update-of-the-drug-combination	10.1093/database/bau124	21059682,15286737,19345021,12730581,20140234,23907796,22877768,22905152,24214961,25168772,21948793,21447597,14681409,24243840,24234451,23782618,19180105,6968746,7586947,12657721,23963360,24107779,23695170,24612502,19169686,23050968,22368688,17426060,24211163,17538086,21664867,23879405,24931988,24065146,20068163,23555229	http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/dcdb/,http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/dcdb/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	DCDB	http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/dcdb/	database

Towards that end, he or she will search a variety of public and propriety databases for information linking that protein to the observed AE. However, these databases tend to present all available information about a protein, which can be overwhelming, limiting the ability to find information about the specific toxicity being investigated. ToxReporter compiles information from a broad selection of resources and limits display of the information to user-selected areas of interest. ToxReporter is a PERL-based web-application which utilizes a MySQL database to streamline this process by categorizing public and proprietary domain-derived information into predefined safety categories according to a customizable lexicon. Users can view gene information that is ‘red-flagged’ according to the safety issue under investigation. ToxReporter also uses a scoring system based on relative counts of the red-flags to rank all genes for the amount of information pertaining to each safety issue and to display their scored ranking as an easily interpretable ‘Tox-At-A-Glance’ chart. Although ToxReporter was originally developed to display safety information, its flexible design could easily be adapted to display disease information as well.Database URL:ToxReporter is freely available athttps://github.com/mgosink/ToxReporter.	2016-10-02	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw141%2f2549238%2fToxReporter-viewing-the-genome-through-the-eyes-of	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2549238/ToxReporter-viewing-the-genome-through-the-eyes-of	10.1093/database/baw141	24481293,26615191,25428369,26578600,15075390,15118671,24316577,22194743,25326323,24203711,10090336,12050272,26313897,23847053	https://github.com/mgosink/ToxReporter,http://www.mysql.com/,https://github.com/mgosink/ToxReporter,http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity,http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	ToxReporter	https://github.com/mgosink/ToxReporter	NULL

Adeola,Junying Zhang,Hai-Bing Xie,Ya-Ping Zhang	NULL	Pigs are excellent large-animal models for medical research and a promising organ donor source for transplant patients. Next-generation sequencing technology has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume of genomic data for pigs. However, the limited amount of variation data provided by dbSNP, and non-congruent criteria used for calling variation, present considerable hindrances to the utility of this data. We used a uniform pipeline, based on GATK, to identify non-redundant, high-quality, whole-genome SNPs from 280 pigs and 6 outgroup species. A total of 64.6 million SNPs were identified in 280 pigs and 36.8 million in the outgroups. We then used LUMPY to identify a total of 7 236 813 structural variations (SVs) in 211 pigs. Positively selected loci were identified through five statistical tests of different evolutionary attributes of the SNPs. Combining the non-redundant variations and the evolutionary selective scores, we built the first pig-specific variation database, PigVar (http://www.ibiomedical.net/pigvar/), which is a web-based open-access resource. PigVar collects parameters of the variations including summary lists of the locations of the variations within protein-coding and long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, whether the SNPs are synonymous or non-synonymous, their ancestral and derived states, geographic sampling locations, as well as breed information.

Caris-Maldonado,Aldina Barral,Vinicius Maracaja-Coutinho,Artur T. L. De Queiroz	NULL	Leishmania braziliensisis the etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease with high public health importance, affecting 12 million people worldwide. Although its genome sequence was originally published in 2007, the two reference public annotations still presents at least 80% of the genes simply classified as hypothetical or putative proteins. Furthermore, it is notable the absence of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences fromLeishmaniaspecies in public databases. These poorly annotated coding genes and ncRNAs could be important players for the understanding of this protozoan biology, the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions and disease control. Herein, we performed a new prediction and annotation ofL. braziliensisprotein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, using recently developed predictive algorithms and updated databases. In summary, we identified 11 491 ORFs, with 5263 (45.80%) of them associated with proteins available in public databases. Moreover, we identified for the first time the repertoire of 11 243 ncRNAs belonging to different classes distributed along the genome. The accuracy of our predictions was verified by transcriptional evidence using RNA-seq, confirming that they are actually generating real transcripts. These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com), which represents an improvement on the publicly available data related to genomic annotation forL. braziliensis.

Rouard	NULL	Unraveling the genetic diversity held in genebanks on a large scale is underway, due to advances in Next-generation sequence (NGS) based technologies that produce high-density genetic markers for a large number of samples at low cost. Genebank users should be in a position to identify and select germplasm from the global genepool based on a combination of passport, genotypic and phenotypic data. To facilitate this, a new generation of information systems is being designed to efficiently handle data and link it with other external resources such as genome or breeding databases. TheMusaGermplasm Information System (MGIS), the database for globalex situ-held banana genetic resources, has been developed to address those needs in a user-friendly way. In developing MGIS, we selected a generic database schema (Chado), the robust content management system Drupal for the user interface, and Tripal, a set of Drupal modules which links the Chado schema to Drupal. MGIS allows germplasm collection examination, accession browsing, advanced search functions, and germplasm orders. Additionally, we developed unique graphical interfaces to compare accessions and to explore them based on their taxonomic information. Accession-based data has been enriched with publications, genotyping studies and associated genotyping datasets reporting on germplasm use. Finally, an interoperability layer has been implemented to facilitate the link with complementary databases like the Banana Genome Hub and the MusaBase breeding database.Database URL:https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/	2017-06-11	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbax046%2f3866796%2fMGIS-managing-banana-Musa-spp-genetic-resources	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/3866796/MGIS-managing-banana-Musa-spp-genetic-resources	10.1093/database/bax046	25414324,26432828,22110026,20864446,20040540,25428362,26989146,23823779,22314574,26151137,27267963,27200084,26584184,22801500,27590334,26984673,23707967,27267926,22517427,20956241,21959868,17646315,24225320,24203703,25432968,25392413,22285827,26040700,22934074	https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/,http://www.genesys-pgr.org,http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs,http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/areas-of-work/global-information-system/faq/en/,http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/en/,http://www.musalit.org/,http://www.drupal.org/,http://www.drupal.org/project/tripal_mc,http://www.elastic.co/,http://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_elasticsearch,http://www.drupal.org/project/faceted_search,http://www.drupal.org/project/biblio,http://banana-genome-hub.southgreen.fr,http://sniplay.southgreen.fr,http://musabase.org,http://docs.brapi.apiary.io,http://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/brapi/overview,http://www.drupal.org/project/brapi,http://www.genesys-pgr.org/wiews/BEL084,https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/67158	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=15&types=bttttttt	NULL	MGIS	https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/	NULL

We present GeneHancer, a novel database of human enhancers and their inferred target genes, in the framework of GeneCards. First, we integrated a total of 434 000 reported enhancers from four different genome-wide databases: the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Ensembl regulatory build, the functional annotation of the mammalian genome (FANTOM) project and the VISTA Enhancer Browser. Employing an integration algorithm that aims to remove redundancy, GeneHancer portrays 285 000 integrated candidate enhancers (covering 12.4% of the genome), 94 000 of which are derived from more than one source, and each assigned an annotation-derived confidence score. GeneHancer subsequently links enhancers to genes, using: tissue co-expression correlation between genes and enhancer RNAs, as well as enhancer-targeted transcription factor genes; expression quantitative trait loci for variants within enhancers; and capture Hi-C, a promoter-specific genome conformation assay. The individual scores based on each of these four methods, along with gene–enhancer genomic distances, form the basis for GeneHancer’s combinatorial likelihood-based scores for enhancer–gene pairing. Finally, we define ‘elite’ enhancer–gene relations reflecting both a high-likelihood enhancer definition and a strong enhancer–gene association.GeneHancer predictions are fully integrated in the widely used GeneCards Suite, whereby candidate enhancers and their annotations are displayed on every relevant GeneCard. This assists in the mapping of non-coding variants to enhancers, and via the linked genes, forms a basis for variant–phenotype interpretation of whole-genome sequences in health and disease.Database URL:http://www.genecards.org/	2017-04-17	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbax028%2f3737828%2fGeneHancer-genome-wide-integration-of-enhancers	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/3737828/GeneHancer-genome-wide-integration-of-enhancers	10.1093/database/bax028	23124110,24913666,22231485,27256877,9679020,10521391,18282519,27259200,23503198,22955616,25956793,26446758,24614317,17086198,17130149,23512712,26072433,24038352,25887522,20485488,20393465,24670763,22955621,17101994,23045397,2476809,23595227,27064255,26780995,25938943,23275551,24599251,21779441,19274049,12837695,8036168,27666372,25693563,24351709,12045153,20110278,23193254,23715323,14597658,27569544,27703156,27984737,27322403,12855462,1321810,24667536,11895428,26462560,26560027,2798417,25378343,23180783,27357948,23713453,23940716,2926813,26644415,25461775,26317464,26599498,26073855,21441907,23935528,25453756,26066708,25695508,27306882,22584950,27008867,27311568,27851967,25497547	http://www.genecards.org/,http://zlab-annotations.umassmed.edu/enhancers/methods,http://nemates.org/MA/progs/representation.stats.html,http://www.genecards.org/,https://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml,https://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml	NULL	NULL	GeneCards	http://www.genecards.org/	NULL

Retrieval and visualization of these data in the context of molecular network maps can provide insights into the pattern of regulation of molecular functions reflected by an omics profile. In order to make this task easy, we developed NaviCom, a Python package and web platform for visualization of multi-level omics data on top of biological network maps. NaviCom is bridging the gap between cBioPortal, the most used resource of large-scale cancer omics data and NaviCell, a data visualization web service that contains several molecular network map collections. NaviCom proposes several standardized modes of data display on top of molecular network maps, allowing addressing specific biological questions. We illustrate how users can easily create interactive network-based cancer molecular portraits via NaviCom web interface using the maps of Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN) and other maps.

The information stems primarily from many thousands of biomedical publications that database curators must go through and read. Given the very large number of biomedical papers published each year, automatic document classification plays an important role in biomedical research. Specifically, an effective and efficient document classifier is needed for supporting the GXD annotation workflow. We present here an effective yet relatively simple classification scheme, which uses readily available tools while employing feature selection, aiming to assist curators in identifying publications relevant to GXD. We examine the performance of our method over a large manually curated dataset, consisting of more than 25 000 PubMed abstracts, of which about half are curated as relevant to GXD while the other half as irrelevant to GXD. In addition to text from title-and-abstract, we also consider image captions, an important information source that we integrate into our method. We apply a captions-based classifier to a subset of about 3300 documents, for which the full text of the curated articles is available. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is robust and effectively addresses the GXD document classification. Moreover, using information obtained from image captions clearly improves performance, compared to title and abstract alone, affirming the utility of image captions as a substantial evidence source for automatically determining the relevance of biomedical publications to a specific subject area.Database URL:www.informatics.jax.org	2017-03-24	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbax017%2f3084695%2fEffective-biomedical-document-classification-for	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/3084695/Effective-biomedical-document-classification-for	10.1093/database/bax017	16507357,15826357,25935162,19622167,26045019,25939429,26092688,15846810,27001195,15383839,26578572,10802651,21199577,16873506,20299325,20507917,17199892	http://www.informatics.jax.org,http://www.informatics.jax.org/,http://www.informatics.jax.org/gxdlit,http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/,http://davis.wpi.edu/xmdv/datasets/ohsumed,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/,http://www.brainmap.org,http://www.warmbase.org,http://www.ontogene.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/mscollection	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	GXD	http://www.informatics.jax.org/gxdlit	NULL

Among the various regulators of genes, there is a class of small non-coding RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Although, the relative simplicity of miRNAs and their ability to modulate cellular processes make them attractive therapeutic candidates, their presence in large numbers make it challenging for experimental researchers to interpret the intricacies of the molecular processes they regulate. Most of the existing bioinformatic tools fail to address these challenges. Here, we present a new web resource ‘miRnalyze’ that has been specifically designed to directly identify the putative regulation of cell signaling pathways by miRNAs. The tool integrates miRNA-target predictions with signaling cascade members by utilizing TargetScanHuman 7.1 miRNA-target prediction tool and the KEGG pathway database, and thus provides researchers with in-depth insights into modulation of signal transduction pathways by miRNAs. miRnalyze is capable of identifying common miRNAs targeting more than one gene in the same signaling pathway—a feature that further increases the probability of modulating the pathway and downstream reactions when using miRNA modulators. Additionally, miRnalyze can sort miRNAs according to the seed-match types and TargetScan Context ++ score, thus providing a hierarchical list of most valuable miRNAs. Furthermore, in order to provide users with comprehensive information regarding miRNAs, genes and pathways, miRnalyze also links to expression data of miRNAs (miRmine) and genes (TiGER) and proteome abundance (PaxDb) data.

However, the rate at which new information is being published makes manual curation increasingly unable to cope. Devising new curation strategies that leverage upon data mining and text analysis is, therefore, a promising avenue to help life science databases to cope with the deluge of novel information. In this article, we describe the integration of text mining technologies in the curation pipeline of the RegulonDB database, and discuss how the process can enhance the productivity of the curators.Specifically, a named entity recognition approach is used to pre-annotate terms referring to a set of domain entities which are potentially relevant for the curation process. The annotated documents are presented to the curator, who, thanks to a custom-designed interface, can select sentences containing specific types of entities, thus restricting the amount of text that needs to be inspected. Additionally, a module capable of computing semantic similarity between sentences across the entire collection of articles to be curated is being integrated in the system. We tested the module using three sets of scientific articles and six domain experts. All these improvements are gradually enabling us to obtain a high throughput curation process with the same quality as manual curation.	2017-03-18	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbax012%2f3074784%2fStrategies-towards-digital-and-semi-automated	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/3074784/Strategies-towards-digital-and-semi-automated	10.1093/database/bax012	9399800,23143106,18834491,22580177,23203884,18949600,12644490,10419964,11443091	http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/,http://ecocyc.org/,http://www.ontogene.org/,http://www.ontogene.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	RegulonDB	http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/	NULL

In response, large central resources such as those of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are continually adapting their computational infrastructure to accommodate this large influx of data. New and specialized databases, such as Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database (TSA) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), have been created to aid the development and expansion of centralized repositories. Although the central resource databases are under continual development, they do not include automatic pipelines to increase annotation of newly deposited data. Therefore, third-party applications are required to achieve that aim. Here, we present an automatic workflow and web application for the annotation of transcriptome data. The workflow creates secondary data such as sequencing reads and BLAST alignments, which are available through the web application. They are based on freely available bioinformatics tools and scripts developed in-house. The interactive web application provides a search engine and several browser utilities. Graphical views of transcript alignments are available through SeqViewer, an embedded tool developed by NCBI for viewing biological sequence data. The web application is tightly integrated with other NCBI web applications and tools to extend the functionality of data processing and interconnectivity.

Rapid advances in studies on the omics of silkworm pathogens have produced a large amount of data, which need to be brought together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner. This will facilitate the reuse of these data for further analysis. We have collected genomic data for 86 silkworm pathogens from 4 taxa (fungi, microsporidia, bacteria and viruses) and from 4 lepidopteran hosts, and developed the open-access Silkworm Pathogen Database (SilkPathDB) to make this information readily available. The implementation of SilkPathDB involves integrating Drupal and GBrowse as a graphic interface for a Chado relational database which houses all of the datasets involved. The genomes have been assembled and annotated for comparative purposes and allow the search and analysis of homologous sequences, transposable elements, protein subcellular locations, including secreted proteins, and gene ontology.

In response, crops have evolved various defense systems to protect themselves against this and other pathogens.Penicillium–crop interaction is a multifaceted process and mediated by pathogen- and host-derived proteins. Identification and characterization of the inter-species protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying infection processes betweenP. expansumand plant crops. Here, we have developed PCPPI, thePenicillium-Crop Protein–Protein Interactions database, which is constructed based on the experimentally determined orthologous interactions in pathogen–plant systems and available domain–domain interactions (DDIs) in each PPI. Thus far, it stores information on 9911 proteins, 439 904 interactions and seven host species, including apple, kiwifruit, maize, pear, rice, strawberry and tomato. Further analysis through the gene ontology (GO) annotation indicated that proteins with more interacting partners tend to execute the essential function. Significantly, semantic statistics of the GO terms also provided strong support for the accuracy of our predicted interactions in PCPPI. We believe that all the PCPPI datasets are helpful to facilitate the study of pathogen-crop interactions and freely available to the research community.Database URL:http://bdg.hfut.edu.cn/pcppi/index.html	2017-02-26	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw170%2f3053440%2fPCPPI-a-comprehensive-database-for-the-prediction	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/3053440/PCPPI-a-comprehensive-database-for-the-prediction	10.1093/database/baw170	22029919,20507522,18943818,18215330,24240319,26284100,24024763,22352719,17465672,25414340,23515528,19674441,17646292,24137008,21786137,25392406,18974184,24948776,20802477,26432828,24699266,24282021,22660326,21113022,20003500,24288371,10802651,15173116,16641319,22345505,21575196,23293649,27121261,26646897,24189443,15719170,17640363,18430080,22578284,21880077,18818697	http://bdg.hfut.edu.cn/pcppi/index.html,http://bdg.hfut.edu.cn/pcppi/index.html,http://fungi.ensembl.org/Penicillium_expansum/Info/Index,http://ftp://bdg.hfut.edu.cn/kiwi/Actinidia_chinensis,http://ftp.maizegdb.org/MaizeGDB/FTP/maize_proteome/,http://plants.ensembl.org/Oryza_sativa/Info/Index,https://www.rosaceae.org/node/4230473,http://ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/,http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/hpi/main.html,http://visjs.org/	NULL	NULL	PCPPI	http://bdg.hfut.edu.cn/pcppi/index.html	database

These types of evidence are emerging for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as well. However, integration of ncRNAs into protein association networks is challenging due to data heterogeneity.

These ncRNA associations cover four organisms and have been established from curated examples, experimental data, interaction predictions and automatic literature mining. RAIN uses an integrative scoring scheme to assign a confidence score to each interaction.

Wallace,Jesse A. Port,Marissa N. Smith,Elaine M. Faustman	NULL	Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a major global public health threat but few resources exist that catalog AR genes outside of a clinical context. Current AR sequence databases are assembled almost exclusively from genomic sequences derived from clinical bacterial isolates and thus do not include many microbial sequences derived from environmental samples that confer resistance in functional metagenomic studies. These environmental metagenomic sequences often show little or no similarity to AR sequences from clinical isolates using standard classification criteria. In addition, existing AR databases provide no information about flanking sequences containing regulatory or mobile genetic elements. To help address this issue, we created an annotated database of DNA and protein sequences derived exclusively from environmental metagenomic sequences showing AR in laboratory experiments. Our Functional Antibiotic Resistant Metagenomic Element (FARME) database is a compilation of publically available DNA sequences and predicted protein sequences conferring AR as well as regulatory elements, mobile genetic elements and predicted proteins flanking antibiotic resistant genes. FARME is the first database to focus on functional metagenomic AR gene elements and provides a resource to better understand AR in the 99% of bacteria which cannot be cultured and the relationship between environmental AR sequences and antibiotic resistant genes derived from cultured isolates.Database URL:http://staff.washington.edu/jwallace/farme	2017-01-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000391494900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2888513/FARME-DB-a-functional-antibiotic-resistance	10.1093/database/baw165	20190823,18534838,18635792,16138100,20850375,22048738,11337221,22191448,18803844,24334622,18832362,23650175,22936781,18073190,14681378,25003965,18843302,22845886,12654685,20453147,24847883,27572443,19168656,20543056,24400528,24236055,18791008,15305923,19713526,24412260,21281423,21965412,24757214,22286984,20382816,20403810,9254694,22039361,17586542,25782011,26097034,24141494	http://staff.washington.edu/jwallace/farme,http://staff.washington.edu/jwallace/farme,http://pfam.xfam.org,http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf,http://hmmer.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=tttttttt	NULL	FARME	http://staff.washington.edu/jwallace/farme	database

Currently, MAHMI database contains over 300 hundred million peptide entries, with detailed information about peptide sequence, sources and potential bioactivity. The reference peptide data section is curated manually by domain experts. Thein silicopeptide data section is populated automatically through the systematic processing of publicly available exoproteomes of the human microbiome. Bioactivity prediction is based on the global alignment of the automatically processed peptides with experimentally validated immunomodulatory and antiproliferative peptides, in the reference section. MAHMI provides researchers with a comparative tool for inspecting the potential immunomodulatory or antiproliferative bioactivity of new amino acidic sequences and identifying promising peptides to be further investigated. Moreover, researchers are welcome to submit new experimental evidence on peptide bioactivity, namely, empiric and structural data, as a proactive, expert means to keep the database updated and improve the implemented bioactivity prediction method. Bioactive peptides identified by MAHMI have a huge biotechnological potential, including the manipulation of aberrant immune responses and the design of new functional ingredients/foods based on the genetic sequences of the human microbiome.

However, this data is typically described in free text form and is not readily amenable to computational analyses. To this end, the BioGRID database systematically curates the biomedical literature for genetic and protein interaction data. This data is provided in a standardized computationally tractable format and includes structured annotation of experimental evidence. BioGRID curation necessarily involves substantial human effort by expert curators who must read each publication to extract the relevant information. Computational text-mining methods offer the potential to augment and accelerate manual curation. To facilitate the development of practical text-mining strategies, a new challenge was organized in BioCreative V for the BioC task, the collaborative Biocurator Assistant Task. This was a non-competitive, cooperative task in which the participants worked together to build BioC-compatible modules into an integrated pipeline to assist BioGRID curators. As an integral part of this task, a test collection of full text articles was developed that contained both biological entity annotations (gene/protein and organism/species) and molecular interaction annotations (protein–protein and genetic interactions (PPIs and GIs)). This collection, which we call the BioC-BioGRID corpus, was annotated by four BioGRID curators over three rounds of annotation and contains 120 full text articles curated in a dataset representing two major model organisms, namely budding yeast and human.

Recently, ncRNA control of gene expression has been identified as a critical regulatory mechanism in the immune system. Despite the great efforts made to discover and characterize ncRNAs, the functional role for most remains unknown. To facilitate discoveries in ncRNA regulation of immune system-related processes, we developed the database of immunologically relevant ncRNAs and target genes (IRNdb). We integrated mouse data on predicted and experimentally supported ncRNA-target interactions, ncRNA and gene annotations, biological pathways and processes and experimental data in a uniform format with a user-friendly web interface. The current version of IRNdb documents 12 930 experimentally supported miRNA-target interactions between 724 miRNAs and 2427 immune-related mouse targets. In addition, we recorded 22 453 lncRNA-immune target and 377 PIWI-interacting RNA-immune target interactions. IRNdb is a comprehensive searchable data repository which will be of help in studying the role of ncRNAs in the immune system.Database URL:http://irndb.org	2016-10-25	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw138%2f2630531%2fIRNdb-the-database-of-immunologically-relevant-non	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630531/IRNdb-the-database-of-immunologically-relevant-non	10.1093/database/baw138	23473599,14744438,24275495,18955434,21842361,19135886,26379013,20003307,21427766,23463798,25869999,24105322,25113636,25055918,20924405,25323317,26578605,24304892,18996891,25399422,25425034,17612493,18158296,17893677,25416797,14709173,21364759,18927107,23175614,23586463,23680784,17331257,25378301,18029362,23180781,24791905,17294181,17434156,15780753,10592173,22096230,10802651,26656494,21546393,17604727,25409824,22940246,18798982,26980489,24304889,21596820,25678556,26117544,25183005,25889518,21326606,25977294,17942429,26998997	http://irndb.org,http://www.septicshock.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene,http://irndb.org,https://www.djangoproject.com/,https://www.nginx.com/,https://www.mysql.com/,https://memcached.org/,http://getbootstrap.com/,https://github.com/sschmeier/irndb2,http://irndb.org,http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/sstar	NULL	NULL	IRNdb	http://irndb.org	database

For network representation, the Biological Expression Language (BEL) is well designed to collate findings from the scientific literature into biological network models. To facilitate encoding and biocuration of such findings in BEL, a BEL Information Extraction Workflow (BELIEF) was developed. BELIEF provides a web-based curation interface, the BELIEF Dashboard, that incorporates text mining techniques to support the biocurator in the generation of BEL networks. The underlying UIMA-based text mining pipeline (BELIEF Pipeline) uses several named entity recognition processes and relationship extraction methods to detect concepts and BEL relationships in literature. The BELIEF Dashboard allows easy curation of the automatically generated BEL statements and their context annotations. Resulting BEL statements and their context annotations can be syntactically and semantically verified to ensure consistency in the BEL network. In summary, the workflow supports experts in different stages of systems biology network building. Based on the BioCreative V BEL track evaluation, we show that the BELIEF Pipeline automatically extracts relationships with an F-score of 36.4% and fully correct statements can be obtained with an F-score of 30.8%. Participation in the BioCreative V Interactive task (IAT) track with BELIEF revealed a systems usability scale (SUS) of 67. Considering the complexity of the task for new users—learning BEL, working with a completely new interface, and performing complex curation—a score so close to the overall SUS average highlights the usability of BELIEF.Database URL:BELIEF is available athttp://www.scaiview.com/belief/	2016-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw136%2f2630528%2fThe-BEL-information-extraction-workflow-BELIEF	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630528/The-BEL-information-extraction-workflow-BELIEF	10.1093/database/baw136	23300411,22155224,21164525,18769432,24444544,20829833,25015298,22011616,25887162,18834494,18834493,19622167,24808858,23517090,15960826,20157492,25157073,18426551,22373375	http://www.scaiview.com/belief/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://resources.belframework.org/belframework/,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/,http://cellontology.org/,http://wiki.openbel.org/,http://www.biocreative.org/,http://uima.apache.org,http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/jsvc.html,http://2013.bionlp-st.org/,https://www.grails.org/,http://www.h2database.com/,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BFD/Getting+Started+-+Getting+Started+Guide,http://www.measuringu.com/sus.php,http://http//2013.bionlp-st.org/,http://www.measuringu.com/blog/10-things-SUS.php	NULL	NULL	BEL	http://www.scaiview.com/belief/	NULL

Experimental methods are costly and time-consuming, while traditional rule-based computational methods fail to annotate sites lacking substantial similarity. Machine Learning (ML) methods are becoming fundamental in annotating unknown proteins and their heterogeneous properties. We present ASAP (Amino-acid Sequence Annotation Prediction), a universal ML framework for predicting residue-level properties. ASAP extracts numerous features from raw sequences, and supports easy integration of external features such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, intrinsically disorder or PSSM profiles. Features are then used to train ML classifiers. ASAP can create new classifiers within minutes for a variety of tasks, including PTM prediction (e.g. cleavage sites by convertase, phosphoserine modification). We present a detailed case study for ASAP: CleavePred, an ASAP-based model to predict protein precursor cleavage sites, with state-of-the-art results. Protein cleavage is a PTM shared by a wide variety of proteins sharing minimal sequence similarity. Current rule-based methods suffer from high false positive rates, making them suboptimal. The high performance of CleavePred makes it suitable for analyzing new proteomes at a genomic scale. The tool is attractive to protein design, mass spectrometry search engines and the discovery of new bioactive peptides from precursors. ASAP functions as a baseline approach for residue-level protein sequence prediction. CleavePred is freely accessible as a web-based application. Both ASAP and CleavePred are open-source with a flexible Python API.Database URL:ASAP’s and CleavePred source code, webtool and tutorials are available at:https://github.com/ddofer/asap;http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred.	2016-10-01	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw133%2f2630524%2fASAP-a-machine-learning-framework-for-local	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630524/ASAP-a-machine-learning-framework-for-local	10.1093/database/baw133	24288371,25428371,24214962,16091411,23353650,27604469,22151968,21959131,15385431,20492656,24302577,25212657,25391399,12824396,23815620,26130574,24336809,14985543,21821666,15937922,25931458,23881252,24792159,23335997,15980571,24860169,16916457,5767777,15955783,24728857,16494967,10644969,26787517,12824418,18991772,19432540,18252740,16845008,18287689,20053844,20709691,18321887,18213482,16674105,23029276,22661580,20013220,22031327,23806756,22679642,22679642	https://github.com/ddofer/asap,http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred,https://github.com/ddofer/asap,https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend,https://github.com/ddofer/asap,https://github.com/ddofer/asap/-wiki/Getting-Started:-A-Basic-Tutorial,http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred,https://github.com/ddofer/asap	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	ASAP	https://github.com/ddofer/asap	NULL

This track consisted of eight subtasks including gene/protein/organism named entity recognition, protein–protein/genetic interaction passage identification and annotation visualization. Using BioC as their data-sharing and communication medium, nine teams, world-wide, participated and contributed either new methods or improvements of existing tools to address different subtasks of the BioC track. Results from different teams were shared in BioC and made available to other teams as they addressed different subtasks of the track. In the end, all submitted runs were merged using a machine learning classifier to produce an optimized output. The biocurator assistant system was evaluated by four BioGRID curators in terms of practical usability. The curators’ feedback was overall positive and highlighted the user-friendly design and the convenient gene/protein curation tool based on text mining.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-1-bioc/	2016-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000383834200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630510/BioCreative-V-BioC-track-overview-collaborative	10.1093/database/baw121	23587305,25428363,22121220,14681454,22513129,24048470,22151929,18834495,20704011,22151968,23327936,24063607,23413997,15960837,20149233,21992002,23823062,21527034,11125102,27170286,15811782,22199390,27515823	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-1-bioc/,http://thebiogrid.org,http://bioc.sourceforge.net,http://corpora.informatik.hu-berlin.de,http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/experimental_systems,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/chemdner-patents-gpro-corpus/,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.006539,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065390,https://sites.google.com/site/hongjiedai/projects/the-ign-corpus,http://proteininformationresource.org/iprolink/corpora,http://ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/mooney/bio-data,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://bioc.sourceforge.net,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/chemdner-patents-gpro-corpus/,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.006539,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065390,https://sites.google.com/site/hongjiedai/projects/the-ign-corpus,http://proteininformationresource.org/iprolink/corpora,http://ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/mooney/bio-data,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora,http://bioc.sourceforge.net,http://alias-i.com/lingpipe,https://lucene.apache.org,http://viewer.bioqrator.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-1-bioc/	NULL

Arighi	NULL	Fully automated text mining (TM) systems promote efficient literature searching, retrieval, and review but are not sufficient to produce ready-to-consume curated documents. These systems are not meant to replace biocurators, but instead to assist them in one or more literature curation steps. To do so, the user interface is an important aspect that needs to be considered for tool adoption. The BioCreative Interactive task (IAT) is a track designed for exploring user-system interactions, promoting development of useful TM tools, and providing a communication channel between the biocuration and the TM communities. In BioCreative V, the IAT track followed a format similar to previous interactive tracks, where the utility and usability of TM tools, as well as the generation of use cases, have been the focal points. The proposed curation tasks are user-centric and formally evaluated by biocurators. In BioCreative V IAT, seven TM systems and 43 biocurators participated. Two levels of user participation were offered to broaden curator involvement and obtain more feedback on usability aspects. The full level participation involved training on the system, curation of a set of documents with and without TM assistance, tracking of time-on-task, and completion of a user survey. The partial level participation was designed to focus on usability aspects of the interface and not the performanceper se. In this case, biocurators navigated the system by performing pre-designed tasks and then were asked whether they were able to achieve the task and the level of difficulty in completing the task. In this manuscript, we describe the development of the interactive task, from planning to execution and discuss major findings for the systems tested.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org	2016-09-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000383834100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630507/Overview-of-the-interactive-task-in-BioCreative-V	10.1093/database/baw119	15960821,18834487,22151647,22513129,23160416,22151968,26210361,26729913,25037308,27242035,27278817,24923820,26883486,24077912,23823062,25619994,25484339,26157623,24144801,26527724,24919658,26093607,25797061	http://www.biocreative.org,http://www.biocreative.org/about/biocreative-v/user-advisory-group,http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-5-IAT,http://www.usability.gov,https://www.surveymonkey.com,http://www.biocreative.org/media/store/files/2015/IATsystemsurveys2015.pdf,http://www.wessa.net/rwasp_kendall.wasp,http://uxpamagazine.org/sustified/,http://www.openbel.org/,http://argo.nactem.ac.uk,http://belief.scai.fraunhofer.de/BeliefDashboard/,https://demo.bmd-software.com/egas/,https://extract.hcmr.gr,http://biominingbu.org/GenDisFinder,http://btm.tmu.edu.tw/metastasisway,http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html,http://www.ontogene.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org	NULL

This initial release contains approximately 1.06 M high quality SNPs for 508 diverse inbred lines obtained by combining variations from RNA sequencing on whole kernels (15 days after pollination) of 368 lines and a 50 K array for all 508 individuals. As all of these data were derived from the same diverse panel of lines, the database also allows various types of genetic mapping (including characterization of phenotypic QTLs, pQTLs; expression QTLs, eQTLs and metabolic QTLs, mQTLs). MODEM is thus designed to promote a better understanding of maize genetic architecture and deep functional annotation of the complex maize genome (and potentially those of other crop plants) and to explore the genotype–phenotype relationships and regulation of maize kernel development at multiple scales, which is also comprehensive for developing novel methods. MODEM is additionally designed to link with other databases to make full use of current resources, and it provides visualization tools for easy browsing. All of the original data and the related mapping results are freely available for easy query and download. This platform also provides helpful tools for general analyses and will be continually updated with additional materials, features and public data related to maize genetics or regulation as they become available.Database URL:(http://modem.hzau.edu.cn)	2016-08-08	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw117%2f2630504%2fMODEM-multi-omics-data-envelopment-and-mining-in	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630504/MODEM-multi-omics-data-envelopment-and-mining-in	10.1093/database/baw117	23242369,24343161,24633423,16381974,20349034,22174790,19497933,19505943,25420514,16532393,19965431,23702596,10835412,16380716,17586829,20463871,19570905,18769488,21785142,17684564,21299659,26529245,27121008,25037214,25869653	http://modem.hzau.edu.cn,http://www.anpel.com.cn/,https://github.com/liujianxiao/MODEM,http://www.highcharts.com/,https://www.r-project.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	MODEM	http://modem.hzau.edu.cn	NULL

Jayaram	NULL	Transcription factors (TFs) bind at multiple sites in the genome and regulate expression of many genes. Regulating TF binding in a gene specific manner remains a formidable challenge in drug discovery because the same binding motif may be present at multiple locations in the genome. Here, we present Onco-Regulon (http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm), an integrated database of regulatory motifs of cancer genes clubbed with Unique Sequence-Predictor (USP) a software suite that identifies unique sequences for each of these regulatory DNA motifs at the specified position in the genome. USP works by extending a given DNA motif, in 5′→3′, 3′ →5′ or both directions by adding one nucleotide at each step, and calculates the frequency of each extended motif in the genome by Frequency Counter programme. This step is iterated till the frequency of the extended motif becomes unity in the genome. Thus, for each given motif, we get three possible unique sequences. Closest Sequence Finder program predicts off-target drug binding in the genome. Inclusion of DNA-Protein structural information further makes Onco-Regulon a highly informative repository for gene specific drug development. We believe that Onco-Regulon will help researchers to design drugs which will bind to an exclusive site in the genome with no off-target effects, theoretically.Database URL:http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm	2016-08-10	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw116%2f2630503%2fOnco-Regulon-an-integrated-database-and-software	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630503/Onco-Regulon-an-integrated-database-and-software	10.1093/database/baw116	20334529,21890896,10222198,15139817,19865164,2421408,22545401,4115108,7063043,4000957,12831879,3120311,15288812,10090291,17419602,2742988,23703209,20865157,12930962,18684996,21330290,17981120,20504768,6854650,3544051,3187531,19443739,19850719,12470729,12360277,2200121	http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm,http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm,http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu,http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene,http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot,http://www.omim.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	Onco-Regulon	http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm	database

Bonthala,MNV Prasad Gajula	NULL	The common bean [Phaseolus vulgaris(L.)] is one of the essential proteinaceous vegetables grown in developing countries. However, its production is challenged by low yields caused by numerous biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Regulatory transcription factors (TFs) symbolize a key component of the genome and are the most significant targets for producing stress tolerant crop and hence functional genomic studies of these TFs are important. Therefore, here we have constructed a web-accessible TFs database forP. vulgaris, called PvTFDB, which contains 2370 putative TF gene models in 49 TF families. This database provides a comprehensive information for each of the identified TF that includes sequence data, functional annotation, SSRs with their primer sets, protein physical properties, chromosomal location, phylogeny, tissue-specific gene expression data, orthologues,cis-regulatory elements and gene ontology (GO) assignment. Altogether, this information would be used in expediting the functional genomic studies of a specific TF(s) of interest. The objectives of this database are to understand functional genomics study of common bean TFs and recognize the regulatory mechanisms underlying various stress responses to ease breeding strategy for variety production through a couple of search interfaces including gene ID, functional annotation and browsing interfaces including by family and by chromosome. This database will also serve as a promising central repository for researchers as well as breeders who are working towards crop improvement of legume crops.

Here, we describe the new corpora in the systems biology modeling language BEL for training and testing biological relationship extraction systems that we prepared for the BioCreative V BEL track. BEL was designed to capture relationships not only between proteins or chemicals, but also complex events such as biological processes or disease states. A BEL nanopub is the smallest unit of information and represents a biological relationship with its provenance. In BEL relationships (called BEL statements), the entities are normalized to defined namespaces mainly derived from public repositories, such as sequence databases, MeSH or publicly available ontologies. In the BEL nanopubs, the BEL statements are associated with citation information and supportive evidence such as a text excerpt. To enable the training of extraction tools, we prepared BEL resources and made them available to the community. We selected a subset of these resources focusing on a reduced set of namespaces, namely, human and mouse genes, ChEBI chemicals, MeSH diseases and GO biological processes, as well as relationship types ‘increases’ and ‘decreases’. The published training corpus contains 11 000 BEL statements from over 6000 supportive text excerpts. For method evaluation, we selected and re-annotated two smaller subcorpora containing 100 text excerpts. For this re-annotation, the inter-annotator agreement was measured by the BEL track evaluation environment and resulted in a maximalF-score of 91.18% for full statement agreement. In addition, for a set of 100 BEL statements, we do not only provide the gold standard expert annotations, but also text excerpts pre-selected by two automated systems. Those text excerpts were evaluated and manually annotated as true or false supportive in the course of the BioCreative V BEL track task.Database URL:http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Datasets	2016-08-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000383832500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630496/Training-and-evaluation-corpora-for-the-extraction	10.1093/database/baw113	22155224,24151423,23160416,15383839,15960826,23160413,23110975,23160414,24571547,25157073,25810766,21414488,26043920,21204038,23906817,18426551,23584833,26099853,26202570,21624156,20829833,19668183,26249223,25887162,25767696,26277032,24266983,25015298,26306861,25361968,25348401,25355515,13982385,25428369,18560118,25810773,27173520,23703206	http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Datasets,http://nanopub.org/wordpress/?page_id=65,http://www.causalbionet.com/,https://bionet.sbvimprover.com/,http://www.selventa.com/science.html,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BELNA/Namespaces+Overview,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BEL/BEL+Language+Home,https://bionet.sbvimprover.com/,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Datasets,http://www.scaiview.com/,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BEL/BEL+Best+Practices,http://wiki.openbel.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10388150,http://bio-eval.scai.fraunhofer.de/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	BEL	http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Datasets	NULL

However, the ambiguous nature of genes and their products have rendered the literature more complex for readers and curators of molecular interaction databases. To address this challenge, a normalization technique that can link variants of biological objects to a single, standardized form was applied. In this work, we developed a species normalization module, which recognizes species names and normalizes them to NCBI Taxonomy IDs. Unlike most previous work, which ignored the prefix of a gene name that represents an abbreviation of the species name to which the gene belongs, the recognition results of our module include the prefixed species. The developed species normalization module achieved an overall F-score of 0.954 on an instance-level species normalization corpus. For gene normalization, two separate modules were respectively employed to recognize gene mentions and normalize those mentions to their Entrez Gene IDs by utilizing a multistage normalization algorithm developed for processing full-text articles.

D. Edwards,A. M. Baldo,L. A. Mueller	NULL	Ricebase (http://ricebase.org) is an integrative genomic database for rice (Oryza sativa) with an emphasis on combining datasets in a way that maintains the key links between past and current genetic studies. Ricebase includes DNA sequence data, gene annotations, nucleotide variation data and molecular marker fragment size data. Rice research has benefited from early adoption and extensive use of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers; however, the majority of rice SSR markers were developed prior to the latest rice pseudomolecule assembly. Interpretation of new research using SNPs in the context of literature citing SSRs requires a common coordinate system. A new pipeline, using a stepwise relaxation of stringency, was used to map SSR primers onto the latest rice pseudomolecule assembly. The SSR markers and experimentally assayed amplicon sizes are presented in a relational database with a web-based front end, and are available as a track loaded in a genome browser with links connecting the browser and database. The combined capabilities of Ricebase link genetic markers, genome context, allele states across rice germplasm and potentially user curated phenotypic interpretations as a community resource for genetic discovery and breeding in rice.	2016-08-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000381521900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630489/Ricebase-a-breeding-and-genetics-platform-for-rice	10.1093/database/baw107	16217597,11935018,11935017,16100779,24280374,26842267,21915109,25429973,25923345,11483586,12597276,2231712,24217918,16403737,25428362,22120662,19570905,23518283,19098269	http://ricebase.org,http://gramene.org,http://github.com/solgenomics/sgn,http://github.com/solgenomics/ricebase,http://jbrowse.org,http://archive.gramene.org/markers/microsat/,http://ftp://ftp.gramene.org/pub/gramene/CURRENT_RELEASE/data/fasta/,http://www.ars.usda.gov/gsor	NULL	NULL	Ricebase	http://ricebase.org	platform

John Wilbur,Dongseop Kwon	NULL	BioC is an XML-based format designed to provide interoperability for text mining tools and manual curation results. A challenge of BioC as a standard format is to align annotations from multiple systems. Ideally, this should not be a major problem if users follow guidelines given by BioC key files. Nevertheless, the misalignment between text and annotations happens quite often because different systems tend to use different software development environments, e.g. ASCII vs. Unicode. We first implemented the BioC Viewer to assist BioGRID curators as a part of the BioCreative V BioC track (Collaborative Biocurator Assistant Task). For the BioC track, the BioC Viewer helped curate protein-protein interaction and genetic interaction pairs appearing in full-text articles. Here, we describe the BioC Viewer itself as well as improvements made to the BioC Viewer since the BioCreative V Workshop to address the misalignment issue of BioC annotations. While uploading BioC files, a BioC merge process is offered when there are files from the same full-text article. If there is a mismatch between an annotated offset and text, the BioC Viewer adjusts the offset to correctly align with the text. The BioC Viewer has a user-friendly interface, where most operations can be performed within a few mouse clicks. The feedback from BioGRID curators has been positive for the web interface, particularly for its usability and learnability.Database URL:http://viewer.bioqrator.org	2016-08-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000381521700001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630488/BioC-viewer-a-web-based-tool-for-displaying-and	10.1093/database/baw106	25428363	http://viewer.bioqrator.org,http://viewer.bioqrator.org,https://github.com/dongseop/bioc_viewer	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioC	https://github.com/dongseop/bioc_viewer	NULL

The FANTOM5 project generated a large data set; including detailed information about the profiled samples, the uncovered TSSs at high base-pair resolution on the genome, their transcriptional initiation activities, and further information of transcriptional regulation. Data sets to explore transcriptome in individual cellular states encoded in the mammalian genomes have been enriched by a series of additional analysis, based on the raw experimental data, along with the progress of the research activities. To make the heterogeneous data set accessible and useful for investigators, we developed a web-based database called Semantic catalog of Samples, Transcription initiation And Regulators (SSTAR). SSTAR utilizes the open source wiki software MediaWiki along with the Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) extension, which provides flexibility to model, store, and display a series of data sets produced during the course of the FANTOM5 project.

A mutant allele present in a cancer cell genome is considered somatic when it’s absent in the paired normal genome along with public SNP databases. The current build of dbSNP, the most comprehensive public SNP database, however inadequately represents several non-European Caucasian populations, posing a limitation in cancer genomic analyses of data from these populations. We present theTataMemorialCentre-SNPdatabase (TMC-SNPdb), as the first open source, flexible, upgradable, and freely available SNP database (accessible through dbSNP build 149 and ANNOVAR)—representing 114 309 unique germline variants—generated from whole exome data of 62 normal samples derived from cancer patients of Indian origin. The TMC-SNPdb is presented with a companion subtraction tool that can be executed with command line option or using an easy-to-use graphical user interface with the ability to deplete additional Indian population specific SNPs over and above dbSNP and 1000 Genomes databases. Using an institutional generated whole exome data set of 132 samples of Indian origin, we demonstrate that TMC-SNPdb could deplete 42, 33 and 28% false positive somatic events post dbSNP depletion in Indian origin tongue, gallbladder, and cervical cancer samples, respectively. Beyond cancer somatic analyses, we anticipate utility of the TMC-SNPdb in several Mendelian germline diseases.

However, some genes lack introns in their coding sequence (CDS) and are generally known as ‘single exon genes’ (SEGs). In this work, a SEG is defined as a nuclear, protein-coding gene that lacks introns in its CDS. Whereas, many public databases of Eukaryotic multi-exon genes are available, there are only two specialized databases for SEGs. The present work addresses the need for a more extensive and diverse database by creating SinEx DB, a publicly available, searchable database of predicted SEGs from 10 completely sequenced mammalian genomes including human. SinEx DB houses the DNA and protein sequence information of these SEGs and includes their functional predictions (KOG) and the relative distribution of these functions within species. The information is stored in a relational database built with My SQL Server 5.1.33 and the complete dataset of SEG sequences and their functional predictions are available for downloading. SinEx DB can be interrogated by: (i) a browsable phylogenetic schema, (ii) carrying out BLAST searches to the in-house SinEx DB of SEGs and (iii) via an advanced search mode in which the database can be searched by key words and any combination of searches by species and predicted functions.

To help the scientific community and database curators deal with this issue, we have developed an application, neXtA5, which prioritizes the literature for specific curation requirements. Our system, neXtA5, is a curation service composed of three main elements. The first component is a named-entity recognition module, which annotates MEDLINE over some predefined axes. This report focuses on three axes: Diseases, the Molecular Function and Biological Process sub-ontologies of the Gene Ontology (GO). The automatic annotations are then stored in a local database, BioMed, for each annotation axis. Additional entities such as species and chemical compounds are also identified. The second component is an existing search engine, which retrieves the most relevant MEDLINE records for any given query. The third component uses the content of BioMed to generate an axis-specific ranking, which takes into account the density of named-entities as stored in the Biomed database. The two ranked lists are ultimately merged using a linear combination, which has been specifically tuned to support the annotation of each axis. The fine-tuning of the coefficients is formally reported for each axis-driven search. Compared with PubMed, which is the system used by most curators, the improvement is the following: +231% for Diseases, +236% for Molecular Functions and +3153% for Biological Process when measuring the precision of the top-returned PMID (P0 or mean reciprocal rank). The current search methods significantly improve the search effectiveness of curators for three important curation axes. Further experiments are being performed to extend the curation types, in particular protein–protein interactions, which require specific relationship extraction capabilities.

Therefore, knowing cooperative TFs is helpful for uncovering the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. In yeast, many cooperative TF pairs have been predicted by various algorithms in the literature. However, until now, there is still no database which collects the predicted yeast cooperative TFs from existing algorithms. This prompts us to construct Cooperative Transcription Factors Database (CoopTFD), which has a comprehensive collection of 2622 predicted cooperative TF pairs (PCTFPs) in yeast from 17 existing algorithms. For each PCTFP, our database also provides five types of validation information: (i) the algorithms which predict this PCTFP, (ii) the publications which experimentally show that this PCTFP has physical or genetic interactions, (iii) the publications which experimentally study the biological roles of both TFs of this PCTFP, (iv) the common Gene Ontology (GO) terms of this PCTFP and (v) the common target genes of this PCTFP. Based on the provided validation information, users can judge the biological plausibility of a PCTFP of interest. We believe that CoopTFD will be a valuable resource for yeast biologists to study the combinatorial regulation of gene expression controlled by cooperative TFs.Database URL:http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/CoopTFD/orhttp://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/CoopTFD/	2016-05-30	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw092%2f2630474%2fCoopTFD-a-repository-for-predicted-yeast	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630474/CoopTFD-a-repository-for-predicted-yeast	10.1093/database/baw092	18811975,17980704,24813990,17720703,16762362,17989095,14627835,16844711,17010188,15343339,16464824,22238267,16126847,20975739,19961622,19661283,25559499,26679776,25521604,26677932,23203989,24234451,10802651,20656902,19061501,21703335,23266802	http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/CoopTFD/,http://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/CoopTFD/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	CoopTFD	http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/CoopTFD/	repository

MET can recognize relations among genes, cancers, tissues and organs of metastasis mentioned in the literature through text-mining techniques, and then produce a visualization of all mined relations in a metastasis network. To facilitate the curation process, MET is developed as a browser extension that allows curators to review and edit concepts and relations related to metastasis directly in PubMed. PubMed users can also view the metastatic networks integrated from the large collection of research papers directly through MET.

Although most EVEs have been inactivated, some open reading frames (ORFs) of EVEs obtained functions in the hosts. However, EVE ORFs usually remain unannotated in the genomes, and no databases are available for EVE ORFs. To investigate the function and evolution of EVEs in mammalian genomes, we developed EVE ORF databases for 20 genomes of 19 mammalian species. A total of 736,771 non-overlapping EVE ORFs were identified and archived in a database named gEVE (http://geve.med.u-tokai.ac.jp). The gEVE database provides nucleotide and amino acid sequences, genomic loci and functional annotations of EVE ORFs for all 20 genomes.

The user can also view and get information on an individual structure or its selected parts, e.g. RNA–protein hydrogen bonds. URSDB employs a new original definition of loops in RNA structures. That definition fits both pseudoknot-free and pseudoknotted secondary structures and coincides with the classical definition in case of pseudoknot-free structures.

Conducting simulation studies can become a complicated task as several challenges can occur, such as the selection of an appropriate simulation tool and the specification of parameters in the simulation model. Although abundant simulated data have been generated for human genetic research, currently there is no public database designed specifically as a repository for these simulated data. With the lack of such a database, for similar studies, similar simulations may have been repeated, which resulted in redundant work. Thus, we created an online platform, the Genetic Epidemiology Simulation Database (GESDB), for simulation data sharing and discussion of simulation techniques for genetic epidemiology studies. GESDB consists of a database for storing simulation scripts, simulated data and documentation from published articles as well as a discussion forum, which provides a platform for discussion of the simulated data and exchanging simulation ideas. Moreover, summary statistics such as the simulation tools that are most commonly used and datasets that are most frequently downloaded are provided.

Several arthropod genomes are available at present and many others will be sequenced in the near future in the context of the i5K initiative, offering opportunities for reconstructing, modelling and comparing their metabolic networks. In-depth analysis of these genomic data through metabolism reconstruction is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the biology of arthropods, thereby allowing the development of new strategies to control harmful species. In this context, we present here ArthropodaCyc, a dedicated BioCyc collection of databases using the Cyc annotation database system (CycADS), allowing researchers to perform reliable metabolism comparisons of fully sequenced arthropods genomes. Since the annotation quality is a key factor when performing such global genome comparisons, all proteins from the genomes included in the ArthropodaCyc database were re-annotated using several annotation tools and orthology information.

The primary source of information for curating biological networks in BEL representation has been literature. It remains a challenge to identify relevant articles and the corresponding evidence statements for curating and validating BEL statements. In this paper, we describe BELTracker, a tool used to retrieve and rank evidence sentences from PubMed abstracts and full-text articles for a given BEL statement (per the 2015 task requirements of BioCreative V BEL Task). The system is comprised of three main components, (i) translation of a given BEL statement to an information retrieval (IR) query, (ii) retrieval of relevant PubMed citations and (iii) finding and ranking the evidence sentences in those citations. BELTracker uses a combination of multiple approaches based on traditional IR, machine learning, and heuristics to accomplish the task. The system identified and ranked at least one fully relevant evidence sentence in the top 10 retrieved sentences for 72 out of 97 BEL statements in the test set. BELTracker achieved a precision of 0.392, 0.532 and 0.615 when evaluated with three criteria, namely full, relaxed and context criteria, respectively, by the task organizers. Our team at Mayo Clinic was the only participant in this task.

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA elements frequently found in plants and are suggested to play important roles in plant sex chromosome evolution. The genomes of several dioecious plants have been sequenced, offering an opportunity to annotate and mine the TE data. However, comprehensive and unified annotation of TEs in these dioecious plants is still lacking. In this study, we constructed a dioecious plant transposable element database (DPTEdb). DPTEdb is a specific, comprehensive and unified relational database and web interface. We used a combination ofde novo, structure-based and homology-based approaches to identify TEs from the genome assemblies of previously published data, as well as our own. The database currently integrates eight dioecious plant species and a total of 31 340 TEs along with classification information. DPTEdb provides user-friendly web interfaces to browse, search and download the TE sequences in the database. Users can also use tools, including BLAST, GetORF, HMMER, Cut sequence and JBrowse, to analyze TE data. Given the role of TEs in plant sex chromosome evolution, the database will contribute to the investigation of TEs in structural, functional and evolutionary dynamics of the genome of dioecious plants. In addition, the database will supplement the research of sex diversification and sex chromosome evolution of dioecious plants.Database URL:http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/DPTEdb/index.php	2016-05-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000375777600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630441/DPTEdb-an-integrative-database-of-transposable	10.1093/database/baw078	16034625,25132181,17984973,18076328,24579996,19478138,17192808,24233721,24265597,26112966,23125359,26053356,23734293,25762551,12175078,16826419,18853265,24751661,23542206,11202435,16391699,20546563,18432245,22014239,16973872,24048436,21623354,23917264,24810432,22096552,21036865,16093699,23886610,25725060,19570905,17485477,19762481,24982153,19651875,20880995,15961452,15961478,26474787,26919983,24051898	http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/DPTEdb/index.php,http://morus.swu.edu.cn/morusdb/,http://w3lamc.umbr.cas.cz/lamc/?page_id=8,http://morus.swu.edu.cn/morusdb/,http://w3lamc.umbr.cas.cz/lamc/?page_id=8,http://www.repeatmasker.org,http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html,http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/DPTEdb/index.php	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	DPTEdb	http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/DPTEdb/index.php	database

These resources cover standards (terminologies, formats and models, and reporting guidelines), databases, and data policies in the life sciences, broadly encompassing the biological, environmental and biomedical sciences. Launched in 2011 and built by the same core team as the successful MIBBI portal, BioSharing harnesses community curation to collate and cross-reference resources across the life sciences from around the world. BioSharing makes these resources findable and accessible (the core of the FAIR principle). Every record is designed to be interlinked, providing a detailed description not only on the resource itself, but also on its relations with other life science infrastructures. Serving a variety of stakeholders, BioSharing cultivates a growing community, to which it offers diverse benefits. It is a resource for funding bodies and journal publishers to navigate the metadata landscape of the biological sciences; an educational resource for librarians and information advisors; a publicising platform for standard and database developers/curators; and a research tool for bench and computer scientists to plan their work. BioSharing is working with an increasing number of journals and other registries, for example linking standards and databases to training material and tools. Driven by an international Advisory Board, the BioSharing user-base has grown by over 40% (by unique IP address), in the last year thanks to successful engagement with researchers, publishers, librarians, developers and other stakeholders via several routes, including a joint RDA/Force11 working group and a collaboration with the International Society for Biocuration.

Their primary function is to allow the host immune system to be able to distinguish between self and non-self peptides—e.g. derived from invading pathogens. However, these genes have also been implicated in immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), presenting a problem to patients, clinicians and pharmaceutical companies. We have previously developed the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) that captures the allelic and haplotype frequencies for these HLA genes across many healthy populations from around the world. Here, we report the development and release of the HLA-ADR database that captures data from publications where HLA alleles and haplotypes have been associated with ADRs (e.g. Stevens–Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug-induced liver injury). HLA-ADR was created by using data obtained through systematic review of the literature and semi-automated literature mining. The database also draws on data already present in AFND allowing users to compare and analyze allele frequencies in both ADR patients and healthy populations.

Recently in BioCreative V, a new challenge was organized for the tasks of disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. Given the nature of both tasks, a test collection is required to contain both disease/chemical annotations and relation annotations in the same set of articles. Despite previous efforts in biomedical corpus construction, none was found to be sufficient for the task. Thus, we developed our own corpus called BC5CDR during the challenge by inviting a team of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexers for disease/chemical entity annotation and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curators for CID relation annotation. To ensure high annotation quality and productivity, detailed annotation guidelines and automatic annotation tools were provided. The resulting BC5CDR corpus consists of 1500 PubMed articles with 4409 annotated chemicals, 5818 diseases and 3116 chemical-disease interactions. Each entity annotation includes both the mention text spans and normalized concept identifiers, using MeSH as the controlled vocabulary. To ensure accuracy, the entities were first captured independently by two annotators followed by a consensus annotation: The average inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores were 87.49% and 96.05% for the disease and chemicals, respectively, in the test set according to the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Our corpus was successfully used for the BioCreative V challenge tasks and should serve as a valuable resource for the text-mining research community.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/	2016-05-08	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000375776900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630414/BioCreative-V-CDR-task-corpus-a-resource-for	10.1093/database/baw068	20157491,18782832,25326323,23703206,23160414,25254099,22151929,24288140,17971238,21933848,23969135,24048470,19814812	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/,http://ctdbase.org,http://ctdbase.org/downloads/#allchems	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/	NULL

It enables its technical users to build their own customised text mining solutions by providing a wide array of interoperable and configurable elementary components that can be seamlessly integrated into processing workflows. With Argo's graphical annotation interface, domain experts can then make use of the workflows' automatically generated output to curate information of interest.With the continuously rising need to understand the aetiology of diseases as well as the demand for their informed diagnosis and personalised treatment, the curation of disease-relevant information from medical and clinical documents has become an indispensable scientific activity. In the Fifth BioCreative Challenge Evaluation Workshop (BioCreative V), there was substantial interest in the mining of literature for disease-relevant information. Apart from a panel discussion focussed on disease annotations, the chemical-disease relations (CDR) track was also organised to foster the sharing and advancement of disease annotation tools and resources.This article presents the application of Argo’s capabilities to the literature-based annotation of diseases. As part of our participation in BioCreative V’s User Interactive Track (IAT), we demonstrated and evaluated Argo’s suitability to the semi-automatic curation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotypes. Furthermore, the workbench facilitated the development of some of the CDR track’s top-performing web services for normalising disease mentions against the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database. In this work, we highlight Argo’s support for developing various types of bespoke workflows ranging from ones which enabled us to easily incorporate information from various databases, to those which train and apply machine learning-based concept recognition models, through to user-interactive ones which allow human curators to manually provide their corrections to automatically generated annotations. Our participation in the BioCreative V challenges shows Argo’s potential as an enabling technology for curating disease and phenotypic information from literature.Database URL:http://argo.nactem.ac.uk	2016-05-17	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw066%2f2630410%2fArgo-enabling-the-development-of-bespoke-workflows	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630410/Argo-enabling-the-development-of-bespoke-workflows	10.1093/database/baw066	20522794,10928714,23190267,14681409,24253303,23180789,21999457,23703206,24393765,25789153,20442139,23969135	http://argo.nactem.ac.uk,http://argo.nactem.ac.uk,http://www.who.int/respiratory/copd/en,http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/tutorials/creating-workflows/,http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/tutorials/curation-of-copd-phenotypes,http://youtu.be/uOjwgmaXk00,http://tinyurl.com/hv9m9tg,http://nersuite.nlplab.org,http://www.stedmansonline.com/webFiles/Dict-Stedmans28/APP05.pdf,http://nactem.ac.uk/biocreative/dner?format=bioc&run=x	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	Argo	http://argo.nactem.ac.uk	NULL

Track 4 at BioCreative V attempts to approach this complexity using fragments of large-scale manually curated biological networks, represented in Biological Expression Language (BEL), as training and test data. BEL is an advanced knowledge representation format which has been designed to be both human readable and machine processable. The specific goal of track 4 was to evaluate text mining systems capable of automatically constructing BEL statements from given evidence text, and of retrieving evidence text for given BEL statements. Given the complexity of the task, we designed an evaluation methodology which gives credit to partially correct statements. We identified various levels of information expressed by BEL statements, such as entities, functions, relations, and introduced an evaluation framework which rewards systems capable of delivering useful BEL fragments at each of these levels. The aim of this evaluation method is to help identify the characteristics of the systems which, if combined, would be most useful for achieving the overall goal of automatically constructing causal biological networks from text.	2016-07-09	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw067%2f2630411%2fBioCreative-V-track-4-a-shared-task-for-the	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630411/BioCreative-V-track-4-a-shared-task-for-the	10.1093/database/baw067	12611808,20829833,22423044,24965703,22011616,21722388,25767696,15960821,25591917,18834493,22151901,18834495	http://www.openbel.org/,https://github.com/OpenBEL/openbel-framework-resources/tree/latest/equivalence,https://bionet.sbvimprover.com/,http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Biocreative+Home,http://bio-eval.scai.fraunhofer.de/cgi-bin/General_server.rc,http://www.openbel.org/tags/bel-parser-belrb,https://github.com/dongseop/simple_bioc,http://bio-eval.scai.fraunhofer.de/cgi-bin/General_server.rc	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Biocreative+Home	NULL

To enable researchers to have a better understanding of ncRNAs’ functions, we updated the NPInter database to version 3.0, which contains experimentally verified interactions between ncRNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs), especially long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other biomolecules (proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs and genomic DNAs). In NPInter v3.0, interactions pertaining to ncRNAs are not only manually curated from scientific literature but also curated from high-throughput technologies. In addition, we also curated lncRNA–miRNA interactions fromin silicopredictions supported by AGO CLIP-seq data. When compared with NPInter v2.0, the interactions are more informative (with additional information on tissues or cell lines, binding sites, conservation, co-expression values and other features) and more organized (with divisions on data sets by data sources, tissues or cell lines, experiments and other criteria). NPInter v3.0 expands the data set to 491,416 interactions in 188 tissues (or cell lines) from 68 kinds of experimental technologies. NPInter v3.0 also improves the user interface and adds new web services, including a local UCSC Genome Browser to visualize binding sites.

The limited scope of these databases, however, poses important challenges on their infrastructure, visibility, funding and usefulness to the broader scientific community. CollecTF is a community-oriented database documenting experimentally validated transcription factor (TF)-binding sites in the Bacteria domain. In its quest to become a community resource for the annotation of transcriptional regulatory elements in bacterial genomes, CollecTF aims to move away from the conventional data-repository paradigm of domain-specific databases. Through the adoption of well-established ontologies, identifiers and collaborations, CollecTF has progressively become also a portal for the annotation and submission of information on transcriptional regulatory elements to major biological sequence resources (RefSeq, UniProtKB and the Gene Ontology Consortium). This fundamental change in database conception capitalizes on the domain-specific knowledge of contributing communities to provide high-quality annotations, while leveraging the availability of stable information hubs to promote long-term access and provide high-visibility to the data. As a submission portal, CollecTF generates TF-binding site information through direct annotation of RefSeq genome records, definition of TF-based regulatory networks in UniProtKB entries and submission of functional annotations to the Gene Ontology. As a database, CollecTF provides enhanced search and browsing, targeted data exports, binding motif analysis tools and integration with motif discovery and search platforms. This innovative approach will allow CollecTF to focus its limited resources on the generation of high-quality information and the provision of specialized access to the data.Database URL:http://www.collectf.org/	2016-04-25	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw055%2f2630369%2fFrom-data-repositories-to-submission-portals	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630369/From-data-repositories-to-submission-portals	10.1093/database/baw055	17108360,20157490,22139927,25593347,18769432,18854352,18832362,21261995,18819940,15973369,20847740,24234444,22121212,25348405,10802651,16845028,26527724,23547897,26013488,24109559,26553804,10592235,15608262,17883408,23161678,10673015,17478497	http://www.collectf.org/,http://collectf.readthedocs.org,http://collectf.org/static/collectf.gpad	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=tttttttt	NULL	CollecTF	http://www.collectf.org/	database

Robert Lai,Tzong-Yi Lee	NULL	Protein ubiquitylation catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the regulation of many cellular processes. Owing to the high throughput of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a number of methods have been developed for the experimental determination of ubiquitylation sites, leading to a large collection of ubiquitylation data. However, there exist no resources for the exploration of E3-ligase-associated regulatory networks of for ubiquitylated proteins in humans. Therefore, the UbiNet database was developed to provide a full investigation of protein ubiquitylation networks by incorporating experimentally verified E3 ligases, ubiquitylated substrates and protein–protein interactions (PPIs). To date, UbiNet has accumulated 43 948 experimentally verified ubiquitylation sites from 14 692 ubiquitylated proteins of humans. Additionally, we have manually curated 499 E3 ligases as well as two E1 activating and 46 E2 conjugating enzymes. To delineate the regulatory networks among E3 ligases and ubiquitylated proteins, a total of 430 530 PPIs were integrated into UbiNet for the exploration of ubiquitylation networks with an interactive network viewer. A case study demonstrated that UbiNet was able to decipher a scheme for the ubiquitylation of tumor proteins p63 and p73 that is consistent with their functions. Although the essential role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is well studied, UbiNet revealed that Mdm2 and additional E3 ligases might be implicated in the regulation of other tumor proteins by protein ubiquitylation. Moreover, UbiNet could identify potential substrates for a specific E3 ligase based on PPIs and substrate motifs.

However, such patterns are often highly variable across compounds and lack robustness. We and others have previously shown that supervised expression patterns based on pathway concepts rather than unsupervised patterns are more robust and can be used to assess toxicity for entire classes of drugs more reliably.Results:We have developed a database, ToxDB, for the analysis of the functional consequences of drug treatment at the pathway level. We have collected 2694 pathway concepts and computed numerical response scores of these pathways for 437 drugs and chemicals and 7464 different experimental conditions.

Extensive HIV research has been performed, generating a large amount of HIV and host genomic data. However, no effective vaccine that protects the host from HIV infection is available and HIV is still spreading at an alarming rate, despite effective antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. In order to develop effective therapies, we need to expand our knowledge of the interaction between HIV and host proteins. In contrast to virus proteins, which often rapidly evolve drug resistance mutations, the host proteins are essentially invariant within all humans. Thus, if we can identify the host proteins needed for virus replication, such as those involved in transporting viral proteins to the cell surface, we have a chance of interrupting viral replication. There is no proteome resource that summarizes this interaction, making research on this subject a difficult enterprise. In order to fill this gap in knowledge, we curated a resource presents detailed annotation on the interaction between the HIV proteome and host proteins. Our resource was produced in collaboration with ViralZone and used manual curation techniques developed by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Our new website also used previous annotations of the BioAfrica HIV-1 Proteome Resource, which has been accessed by approximately 10 000 unique users a year since its inception in 2005. The novel features include a dedicated new page for each HIV protein, a graphic display of its function and a section on its interaction with host proteins. Our new webpages also add information on the genomic location of each HIV protein and the position of ARV drug resistance mutations. Our improved BioAfrica HIV-1 Proteome Resource fills a gap in the current knowledge of biocuration.Database URL:http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/HIVproteome.html	2016-04-16	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw045%2f2630327%2fImproving-HIV-proteome-annotation-new-features-of	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630327/Improving-HIV-proteome-annotation-new-features-of	10.1093/database/baw045	NULL	http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/HIVproteome.html,http://hivdb.stanford.edu,http://bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/hivdb/pages/download/resistanceMutations_handout.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/,http://pfam.xfam.org/,http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/index.html,http://blocks.fhcrc.org/,http://prosite.expasy.org/,http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/index.php,http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/155971,http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04608,http://www.bioafrica.net,http://www.bioafrica.net//proteomics2005/POL-PRprot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/POL-PRprot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/HIVproteome.html,http://bioafrica.net/proteomics/ENV-GP120prot.html,http://bioafrica.net/proteomics/ENV-GP120prot.html,http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/3942.html,http://bioafrica.net/proteomics/REVprot.html,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://bioafrica.net/proteomics/ENV-GP120prot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/POL-PRprot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/POL-RTprot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/POL-INprot.html,http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/ENVprot.html,http://bioafrica.net/proteomics/ENVprot.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioAfrica	http://www.bioafrica.net/proteomics/HIVproteome.html	NULL

Its recent genomic variants, e.g. Hi-C/ chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET), have enabled the study of nuclear organization at an unprecedented level. However, due to the inherent low resolution and ultrahigh cost of Hi-C/ChIA-PET, 3C is still the gold standard for determining interactions between given regulatory DNA elements, such as enhancers and promoters. Therefore, we developed a database of 3C determined functional chromatin interactions (3CDB;http://3cdb.big.ac.cn). To construct 3CDB, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar with carefully designed keyword combinations and retrieved more than 5000 articles from which we manually extracted 3319 interactions in 17 species. Moreover, we proposed a systematic evaluation scheme for data reliability and classified the interactions into four categories. Contact frequencies are not directly comparable as a result of various modified 3C protocols employed among laboratories. Our evaluation scheme provides a plausible solution to this long-standing problem in the field. A user-friendly web interface was designed to assist quick searches in 3CDB. We believe that 3CDB will provide fundamental information for experimental design and phylogenetic analysis, as well as bridge the gap between molecular and systems biologists who must now contend with noisy high-throughput data.Database URL:http://3cdb.big.ac.cn	2016-04-14	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374096900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630323/3CDB-a-manually-curated-database-of-chromosome	10.1093/database/baw044	21855411,22265404,24213634,19741700,11847345,22215806,23199640,19815776,21685913,22495300,22495304,23706625,24141950,25497547,16369547,11847345,24526713,25788621,20436457,19890323,24931992,24519450,26000633,23382666	http://3cdb.big.ac.cn,http://3cdb.big.ac.cn,http://3cdb.big.ac.cn,http://3dgd.biosino.org,http://4dgenome.int-med.uiowa.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=11&types=tttttttt	NULL	3CDB	http://3cdb.big.ac.cn	database

As next-generation sequencing technologies improve, the amount of literature containing genomic variant data, such as new functions or related phenotypes, rapidly increases. Because numerous articles are published every day, it is almost impossible to manually curate all the variant information from the literature. Many researchers focus on creating an improved automated biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) method that extracts useful variants and their functional information from the literature. However, there is no gold-standard data set that contains texts annotated with variants and their related functions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Biomedical entity Relation ONcology COrpus (BRONCO) that contains more than 400 variants and their relations with genes, diseases, drugs and cell lines in the context of cancer and anti-tumor drug screening research. The variants and their relations were manually extracted from 108 full-text articles. BRONCO can be utilized to evaluate and train new methods used for extracting biomedical entity relations from full-text publications, and thus be a valuable resource to the biomedical text mining research community. Using BRONCO, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art BioNLP methods. We also identified their shortcomings, and suggested remedies for each method. We implemented post-processing modules for the three BioNLP methods, which improved their performance.Database URL:http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco	2016-04-13	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374096000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630320/BRONCO-Biomedical-entity-Relation-ONcology-COrpus	10.1093/database/baw043	24071849,21930502,19561590,20354512,11125122,23128226,22955616,22992668,14990452,10612815,21138947,17495998,25285203,23584833,20920264,2051488,25246425	http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco,http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/,http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bioentityextractor/,http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco,http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco,http://mutationfinder.sourceforge.net,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/,http://bioinf.umbc.edu/EMU/ftp,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/pub/tmVar/,http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census,http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco,https://pct.mdanderson.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	BRONCO	http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco	NULL

Lemmon	NULL	Spinal cord injury (SCI) research is a data-rich field that aims to identify the biological mechanisms resulting in loss of function and mobility after SCI, as well as develop therapies that promote recovery after injury. SCI experimental methods, data and domain knowledge are locked in the largely unstructured text of scientific publications, making large scale integration with existing bioinformatics resources and subsequent analysis infeasible. The lack of standard reporting for experiment variables and results also makes experiment replicability a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we have developed RegenBase, a knowledge base of SCI biology. RegenBase integrates curated literature-sourced facts and experimental details, raw assay data profiling the effect of compounds on enzyme activity and cell growth, and structured SCI domain knowledge in the form of the first ontology for SCI, using Semantic Web representation languages and frameworks.

The BioCreative V organized a Chemical Disease Relation (CDR) Track regarding chemical-induced disease relation extraction from biomedical literature in 2015. We participated in all subtasks of this challenge. In this article, we present our participation system Chemical Disease Relation Extraction SysTem (CD-REST), an end-to-end system for extracting chemical-induced disease relations in biomedical literature. CD-REST consists of two main components: (1) a chemical and disease named entity recognition and normalization module, which employs the Conditional Random Fields algorithm for entity recognition and a Vector Space Model-based approach for normalization; and (2) a relation extraction module that classifies both sentence-level and document-level candidate drug–disease pairs by support vector machines. Our system achieved the best performance on the chemical-induced disease relation extraction subtask in the BioCreative V CDR Track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed machine learning-based approaches for automatic extraction of chemical-induced disease relations in biomedical literature.

To meet the needs of the many users whose research is disease oriented, RGD has created a series of Disease Portals and has prioritized its curation efforts on the datasets important to understanding the mechanisms of various diseases. Gene-disease relationships for three species, rat, human and mouse, are annotated to capture biomarkers, genetic associations, molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To generate gene–disease annotations more effectively and in greater detail, RGD initially adopted the MEDIC disease vocabulary from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and adapted it for use by expanding this framework with the addition of over 1000 terms to create the RGD Disease Ontology (RDO). The RDO provides the foundation for, at present, 10 comprehensive disease area-related dataset and analysis platforms at RGD, the Disease Portals. Two major disease areas are the focus of data acquisition and curation efforts each year, leading to the release of the related Disease Portals.

However, accessing this wealth of plant diversity requires the characterization of this material using state-of-the-art genomic, phenomic and molecular technologies and the release of subsequent research data via a long-term stable, open-access portal. Although several international consortia and public resource centres offer services for plant research data management, valuable digital assets remains unpublished and thus inaccessible to the scientific community. Recently, the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research and the German Plant Phenotyping Network have jointly initiated the Plant Genomics and Phenomics Research Data Repository (PGP) as infrastructure to comprehensively publish plant research data. This covers in particular cross-domain datasets that are not being published in central repositories because of its volume or unsupported data scope, like image collections from plant phenotyping and microscopy, unfinished genomes, genotyping data, visualizations of morphological plant models, data from mass spectrometry as well as software and documents.The repository is hosted at Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research using e!DAL as software infrastructure and a Hierarchical Storage Management System as data archival backend. A novel developed data submission tool was made available for the consortium that features a high level of automation to lower the barriers of data publication. After an internal review process, data are published as citable digital object identifiers and a core set of technical metadata is registered at DataCite. The used e!DAL-embedded Web frontend generates for each dataset a landing page and supports an interactive exploration. PGP is registered as research data repository at BioSharing.org, re3data.org and OpenAIRE as valid EU Horizon 2020 open data archive.

Mattingly,Jiao Li,Thomas C. Wiegers,Zhiyong Lu	NULL	Manually curating chemicals, diseases and their relationships is significantly important to biomedical research, but it is plagued by its high cost and the rapid growth of the biomedical literature. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing computational approaches for automatic chemical-disease relation (CDR) extraction. Despite these attempts, the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking dataset has limited the comparison of different techniques in order to assess and advance the current state-of-the-art. To this end, we organized a challenge task through BioCreative V to automatically extract CDRs from the literature. We designed two challenge tasks: disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. To assist system development and assessment, we created a large annotated text corpus that consisted of human annotations of chemicals, diseases and their interactions from 1500 PubMed articles. 34 teams worldwide participated in the CDR task: 16 (DNER) and 18 (CID). The best systems achieved an F-score of 86.46% for the DNER task—a result that approaches the human inter-annotator agreement (0.8875)—and an F-score of 57.03% for the CID task, the highest results ever reported for such tasks. When combining team results via machine learning, the ensemble system was able to further improve over the best team results by achieving 88.89% and 62.80% in F-score for the DNER and CID task, respectively. Additionally, another novel aspect of our evaluation is to test each participating system’s ability to return real-time results: the average response time for each team’s DNER and CID web service systems were 5.6 and 9.3 s, respectively. Most teams used hybrid systems for their submissions based on machining learning. Given the level of participation and results, we found our task to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community, producing a large annotated corpus and improving the results of automatic disease recognition and CDR extraction.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/	2016-03-19	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374092800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630271/Assessing-the-state-of-the-art-in-biomedical	10.1093/database/baw032	21094696,23443757,25326323,24928448,22554700,22554702,23118093,24158091,23969135,24393765,26187250,25935162,23180769,11418538,25147248,25705261	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/,http://ctdbase.org/,http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/biocreative-v-cdr-corpus/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/	NULL

Data are automatically mined from ∼120 sources and presented in an integrated web card for every human gene. We report the application of recent advances in proteomics to enhance gene annotation and classification in GeneCards. First, we constructed the Human Integrated Protein Expression Database (HIPED), a unified database of protein abundance in human tissues, based on the publically available mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics sources ProteomicsDB, Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database, Protein Abundance Across Organisms and The MaxQuant DataBase. The integrated database, residing within GeneCards, compares favourably with its individual sources, covering nearly 90% of human protein-coding genes. For gene annotation and comparisons, we first defined a protein expression vector for each gene, based on normalized abundances in 69 normal human tissues. This vector is portrayed in the GeneCards expression section as a bar graph, allowing visual inspection and comparison. These data are juxtaposed with transcriptome bar graphs. Using the protein expression vectors, we further defined a pairwise metric that helps assess expression-based pairwise proximity. This new metric for finding functional partners complements eight others, including sharing of pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms and domains, implemented in the GeneCards Suite. In parallel, we calculated proteome-based differential expression, highlighting a subset of tissues that overexpress a gene and subserving gene classification. This textual annotation allows users of VarElect, the suite’s next-generation phenotyper, to more effectively discover causative disease variants. Finally, we define the protein–RNA expression ratio and correlation as yet another attribute of every gene in each tissue, adding further annotative information.

Many proteins undergo conformational changes upon these interactions, where regions with large conformational changes are critical to the interactions. This work presents the CCProf platform, which provides conformational changes of entire proteins, named conformational change profile (CCP) in the context. CCProf aims to be a platform where users can study potential causes of novel conformational changes. It provides 10 biological features, including conformational change, potential binding target site, secondary structure, conservation, disorder propensity, hydropathy propensity, sequence domain, structural domain, phosphorylation site and catalytic site. All these information are integrated into a well-aligned view, so that researchers can capture important relevance between different biological features visually. The CCProf contains 986 187 protein structure pairs for 3123 proteins. In addition, CCProf provides a 3D view in which users can see the protein structures before and after conformational changes as well as binding targets that induce conformational changes. All information (e.g. CCP, binding targets and protein structures) shown in CCProf, including intermediate data are available for download to expedite further analyses.Database URL:http://zoro.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ccprof/	2016-03-25	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw029%2f2630259%2fCCProf-exploring-conformational-change-profile-of	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630259/CCProf-exploring-conformational-change-profile-of	10.1093/database/baw029	20066034,17217965,369601,18393864,8264659,10788501,19676113,5238663,12520056,19906708,22084200,21097895,23846747,22080505,283394,18641126,10592235,15215342,17206849,16551371,9309224,14681372,24288371,7723011,10880354,21062810,14681376,22638586,15215457,16777907,11125097,6667333,15653742,6518262,15980475,19656955,20435678,12112692,11524371,11699879,14635255,11114334,23087378,18055497	http://zoro.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ccprof/,http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/JSmol	NULL	NULL	CCProf	http://zoro.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ccprof/	NULL

As a corollary, annotation stability is considered to be a measure of reliability. However, diverse data-driven events can affect the stability of annotations in both primary protein sequence databases and the protein family databases that are built upon the sequence databases and used to help annotate them. Here, we describe some of these events and their consequences for the InterPro database, and demonstrate that annotation removal or reassignment is not always linked to incorrect annotation by the curator.Database URL:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro	2016-03-19	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374091400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630251/GO-annotation-in-InterPro-why-stability-does-not	10.1093/database/baw027	25428371,25348399,23193289,24288371,22508994,12230033,23161676,25300481,25414345,23197656,25348405,22693439,24641996,20015972,26578592,20729831,24599061,25752603,18475267,8625414	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro	NULL	NULL	InterPro	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro	NULL

Specifically, there are several million citations in the field of cancer. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to manually retrieve relevant information on the mechanisms that govern tumor behavior or the neoplastic process. Furthermore, cancer is a complex disease or, more accurately, a set of diseases. The heterogeneity that permeates many tumors is particularly evident in head and neck (HN) cancer, one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. In this study, we present HNdb, a free database that aims to provide a unified and comprehensive resource of information on genes and proteins involved in HN squamous cell carcinoma, covering data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, literature citations and also cross-references of external databases. Different literature searches of MEDLINE abstracts were performed using specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) for oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. A curated gene-to-publication assignment yielded a total of 1370 genes related to HN cancer. The diversity of results allowed identifying novel and mostly unexplored gene associations, revealing,for example, that processes linked to response to steroid hormone stimulus are significantly enriched in genes related to HN carcinomas. Thus, our database expands the possibilities for gene networks investigation, providing potential hypothesis to be tested.Database URL:http://www.gencapo.famerp.br/hndb	2016-03-24	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374091000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630247/HNdb-an-integrated-database-of-gene-and-protein	10.1093/database/baw026	11752295,15068665,16127175,17202168,18953024,23161693,21160525,16364762,9395234,15144956,22311401,21685461,8653682,21376230,18834494,25641519,16418747,10802651,24555475,25954472,22024348,21572887,23282288,10592173,18254958,15170515,16205657,19138406,15381369,14676830,21853135,14729608,22064864,24304889,10592235,19718509,18940858,18048412,16381955,24203711,21059682,19131956,19033363,25348405,21734724,21775818,17318210,22270953,16341083,21430697,23895128,20300207,15459219,19825947,24743148	http://www.gencapo.famerp.br/hndb,http://www.gencapo.famerp.br/hndb/,http://www.gencapo.famerp.br/,http://cancergenome.nih.gov/,http://globocan.iarc.fr/Default.aspx,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,http://www.ensembl.org/,http://www.scopus.com	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	HNdb	http://www.gencapo.famerp.br/hndb	database

Characterizing the genes involved in CSCs regulation is fundamental to understand the mechanisms underlying the biological process and develop treatment methods for tumor therapy. Recently, much effort has been expended in the study of CSCs and a large amount of data has been generated. However, to the best of our knowledge, database dedicated to CSCs is not available until now. We have thus developed a CSCs database (CSCdb), which includes marker genes, CSCs-related genes/microRNAs and functional annotations. The information in the CSCdb was manual collected from about 13 000 articles. The CSCdb provides detailed information of 1769 genes that have been reported to participate in the functional regulation of CSCs and 74 marker genes that can be used for identification or isolation of CSCs. The CSCdb also provides 9475 annotations about 13 CSCs-related functions, such as oncogenesis, radio resistance, tumorigenesis, differentiation, etc. Annotations of the identified genes, which include protein function description, post-transcription modification information, related literature, Gene Ontology (GO), protein-protein interaction (PPI) information and regulatory relationships, are integrated into the CSCdb to help users get information more easily. CSCdb provides a comprehensive resource for CSCs research work, which would assist in finding new CSCs-related genes and would be a useful tool for biologists.Database URL:http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/cscdb	2016-03-17	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw023%2f2630230%2fCSCdb-a-cancer-stem-cells-portal-for-markers	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630230/CSCdb-a-cancer-stem-cells-portal-for-markers	10.1093/database/baw023	22298594,23685952,23548926,23051844,22928012,22121212,23161681,24304892,22080564,23203871,23193290,24243840,17576678,20656902,19289444,21685479,22751434,23811940,20952405,26590405,26026167	http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/cscdb,http://mgrc.kribb.re.kr/cage/pageHome.php?m=hm,http://www.cancerdriver.com,http://www.brainlife.org/database.htm	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=ttttttff	NULL	CSCdb	http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/cscdb	NULL

Buckle	NULL	Proteins with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats are involved in human neurodegenerative diseases, via a gain-of-function mechanism of neuronal toxicity involving protein conformational changes that result in the formation and deposition of β-sheet-rich aggregates. Aggregation is dependent on the context and properties of the host protein, such as domain context and location of the repeat tract. In order to explore this relationship in greater detail, here we describe PolyQ 2.0, an updated database that provides a comprehensive knowledgebase for human polyQ proteins. Compared with the previous PolyQ database, our new database provides a variety of substantial updates including detailed biological annotations and search options. Biological annotations in terms of domain context information, protein structural and functional annotation, single point mutations, predicted disordered regions, protein–protein interaction partners, metabolic/signaling pathways, post-translational modification sites and evolutionary information are made available. Several new database functionalities have also been provided, including search using multiple/combinatory keywords, and submission of new data entries. Also, several third-party plug-ins are employed to enhance data visualization in PolyQ 2.0.

Current standardized methodologies are based on microscopic determinations, which is time consuming and prone to identification uncertainties. The use of DNA-barcoding has been proposed as a way to avoid these flaws. Combining barcoding with next-generation sequencing enables collection of a large quantity of barcodes from natural samples. These barcodes are identified as certain diatom taxa by comparing the sequences to a reference barcoding library using algorithms. Proof of concept was recently demonstrated for synthetic and natural communities and underlined the importance of the quality of this reference library. We present an open-access and curated reference barcoding database for diatoms, called R-Syst::diatom, developed in the framework of R-Syst, the network of systematic supported by INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research), seehttp://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en. R-Syst::diatom links DNA-barcodes to their taxonomical identifications, and is dedicated to identify barcodes from natural samples. The data come from two sources, a culture collection of freshwater algae maintained in INRA in which new strains are regularly deposited and barcoded and from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) nucleotide database. Two kinds of barcodes were chosen to support the database: 18S (18S ribosomal RNA) andrbcL (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), because of their efficiency. Data are curated using innovative (Declic) and classical bioinformatic tools (Blast, classical phylogenies) and up-to-date taxonomy (Catalogues and peer reviewed papers). Every 6 months R-Syst::diatom is updated. The database is available through the R-Syst microalgae website (http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/) and a platform dedicated to next-generation sequencing data analysis, virtual_BiodiversityL@b (https://galaxy-pgtp.pierroton.inra.fr/). We present here the content of the library regarding the number of barcodes and diatom taxa. In addition to these information, morphological features (e.g. biovolumes, chloroplasts…), life-forms (mobility, colony-type) or ecological features (taxa preferenda to pollution) are indicated in R-Syst::diatom.Database URL:http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/	2016-03-17	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000374089900003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630187/R-Syst-diatom-an-open-access-and-curated-barcode	10.1093/database/baw016	23710621,26988318,12614582,21564966,23590277,23193267,23193283,17581782,21239228,23994722,7265238,19854763,21546353,24739436,24392792,22092527,25848969,3224833,17553708,18042429,19345143,27041057,27009733,11491361,21930222	http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en,http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/,https://galaxy-pgtp.pierroton.inra.fr/,http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/,http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/,https://galaxy-pgtp.pierroton.inra.fr/,http://grbio.org/institution/thonon-culture-collection-umr-carrtel-inra,http://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/,http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://www.algaebase.org/,http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/diatoms/names/index.asp,http://www.ccap.ac.uk/,https://galaxy-pgtp.pierroton.inra.fr/,http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en,http://www.boldsystems.org/,http://www.algaebase.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	R-Syst	http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en	database

The core (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) and linker (H1) histone proteins are responsible for this compaction through the formation of nucleosomes and higher order chromatin aggregates. Moreover, histones are intricately involved in chromatin functioning and provide a means for genome dynamic regulation through specific histone variants and histone post-translational modifications. ‘HistoneDB 2.0 – with variants’ is a comprehensive database of histone protein sequences, classified by histone types and variants. All entries in the database are supplemented by rich sequence and structural annotations with many interactive tools to explore and compare sequences of different variants from various organisms. The core of the database is a manually curated set of histone sequences grouped into 30 different variant subsets with variant-specific annotations. The curated set is supplemented by an automatically extracted set of histone sequences from the non-redundant protein database using algorithms trained on the curated set. The interactive web site supports various searching strategies in both datasets: browsing of phylogenetic trees; on-demand generation of multiple sequence alignments with feature annotations; classification of histone-like sequences and browsing of the taxonomic diversity for every histone variant.

Studies to scientifically prove the medical efficacy of herbs for target diseases often spend a considerable amount of time and effort in choosing candidate herbs and in performing experiments to measure changes of marker genes when treating herbs. A computational approach to recommend herbs for treating diseases might be helpful to promote efficiency in the early stage of such studies. Although several databases related to traditional Chinese medicine have been already developed, there is no specialized Web tool yet recommending herbs to treat diseases based on disease-related genes. Therefore, we developed a novel search engine, HerDing, focused on retrieving candidate herb-related information with user search terms (a list of genes, a disease name, a chemical name or an herb name).

Since its first release in 2010, the database has grown constantly and the current version contains 27 protein–protein complexes and 274 protein–inhibitor complexes corresponding to 242 unique small molecule inhibitors which represent almost a 5-fold increase compared to the previous version. A number of new data have been added, including new protein–protein complexes, binding affinities, molecular descriptors, precalculated interface parameters and links to other webservers. A new query tool has been implemented to search for inhibitors within the database using standard molecular descriptors. A novel version of the 2P2I-inspector tool has been implemented to calculate a series of physical and chemical parameters of the protein interfaces. Several geometrical parameters including planarity, eccentricity and circularity have been added as well as customizable distance cutoffs.

We used semantic data mining to retrieve and extract the articles pertaining to preeclampsia-associated genes and performed manual curation. We deposited the articles, genes, preeclampsia phenotypes and other supporting information into the dbPEC. It is publicly available and freely accessible. Previously, we developed a database for preterm birth (dbPTB) using a similar approach. Using the gene sets in dbPTB, we were able to successfully analyze a genome-wide study of preterm birth including 4000 women and children. We identified important genes and pathways associated with preterm birth that were not otherwise demonstrable using genome-wide approaches. dbPEC serves not only as a resources for genes and articles associated with preeclampsia, it is a robust source of gene sets to analyze a wide range of high-throughput data for gene set enrichment analysis.Database URL:http://ptbdb.cs.brown.edu/dbpec/	2016-03-05	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw006%2f2630148%2fdbPEC-a-comprehensive-literature-based-database	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630148/dbPEC-a-comprehensive-literature-based-database	10.1093/database/baw006	16526948,22175024,18303501,24807322,14681465,17984084,16199517,22323062,23298525,23084601	http://ptbdb.cs.brown.edu/dbpec/,http://ptbdb.cs.brown.edu/dbpec/,http://bejerano.stanford.edu/pesnpdb/public/html/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=ttttttff	NULL	dbPEC	http://ptbdb.cs.brown.edu/dbpec/	database

However, sample manual annotation is a highly labor intensive process and requires familiarity with the terminologies used. We have therefore developed an interactive annotation tool, EXTRACT, which helps curators identify and extract standard-compliant terms for annotation of metagenomic records and other samples. Behind its web-based user interface, the system combines published methods for named entity recognition of environment, organism, tissue and disease terms. The evaluators in the BioCreative V Interactive Annotation Task found the system to be intuitive, useful, well documented and sufficiently accurate to be helpful in spotting relevant text passages and extracting organism and environment terms. Comparison of fully manual and text-mining-assisted curation revealed that EXTRACT speeds up annotation by 15–25% and helps curators to detect terms that would otherwise have been missed.Database URL:https://extract.hcmr.gr/	2016-02-19	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000370930100002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630147/EXTRACT-interactive-extraction-of-environment	10.1093/database/baw005	21472015,25378310,22293552,25348409,20052305,22151901,20149233,23823062,25343498,26157623,20442139,20819853,23969135,25484339,25619994,19513049,23468974,23407591,10802651	https://extract.hcmr.gr/,http://environmentontology.org,http://gensc.org,https://extract.hcmr.gr/#extract_help,https://extract.hcmr.gr/and,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=10&types=bttttttt	NULL	EXTRACT	https://extract.hcmr.gr/	NULL

Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most important cereal crops in the world due its importance to human nutrition and health. Thus, identifying and annotating all the gene families in maize is an important primary step in defining their functions and understanding their roles in the regulation of diverse biological processes. In this study, we identified 96 predicted maize gene families and systematically characterized all 5826 of the genes in those families. We have also developed a comprehensive database of maize gene families (the MGFD). To further explore the functions of these gene families, we extensively annotated the genes, including such basic information as protein sequence features, gene structure, Gene Ontology classifications, phylogenetic relationships and expression profiles.

It is one of the key bioinformatics resources for Systems Biology investigations of bacterial gene regulation. Like most biological databases, the content drifts with time, both due to the accumulation of new information and due to refinements in the underlying biological concepts. Conclusions based on previous database versions may no longer hold. Here, we study the change of some topological properties of the TRN ofE.coli, as provided by RegulonDB across 16 versions, as well as a simple index, digital control strength, quantifying the match between gene expression profiles and the transcriptional regulatory networks. While many of network characteristics change dramatically across the different versions, the digital control strength remains rather robust and in tune with previous results for this index.Our study shows that: (i) results derived from network topology should, when possible, be studied across a range of database versions, before detailed biological conclusions are derived, and (ii) resorting to simple indices, when interpreting high-throughput data from a network perspective, may help achieving a robustness of the findings against variation of the underlying biological information.Database URL:www.regulondb.ccg.unam.mx	2016-03-15	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbaw003%2f2630140%2fEffect-of-database-drift-on-network-topology-and	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630140/Effect-of-database-drift-on-network-topology-and	10.1093/database/baw003	18940869,21406074,9399800,23203884,9847141,10592182,11125053,14681419,16381895,18158297,21051347,15107850,17510665,17692874,18836036,21562557,15372033,14735121,17706247,11967538,14607112,12399590,15001784,12202830,18284674,20034377,21097887,19222866,23632383,12952533,17593909,21988831,12566402,15197165,19321003,22663945,16799466	http://www.regulondb.ccg.unam.mx,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-86/,https://github.com/Midnighter/pyorganism,http://sysbio.jacobs-university.de/website/content/data	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	RegulonDB	http://www.regulondb.ccg.unam.mx	database

Therefore, studies on spatial interactions between chromatin have created a new avenue for elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in disease pathogenesis. Recently, a growing number of chromatin interactions have been revealed by means of 3C, 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET and Hi-C technologies. To interpret and utilize these interactions, we constructed chromatin–chromatin spatial interaction (CCSI) database by integrating and annotating 91 sets of chromatin interaction data derived from published literature, UCSC database and NCBI GEO database, resulting in a total of 3 017 962 pairwise interactions (false discovery rate < 0.05), covering human, mouse and yeast.A web interface has been designed to provide access to the chromatin interactions. The main features of CCSI are (i) showing chromatin interactions and corresponding genes, enhancers and SNPs within the regions in the search page; (ii) offering complete interaction datasets, enhancer and SNP information in the download page; and (iii) providing analysis pipeline for the annotation of interaction data.

Currently, it draws from 23 477 articles and describes the systematics and biology of 8194 valid species. For 20 years, ScaleNet ran on the same software platform. That platform is no longer viable. Here, we present a new, open-source implementation of ScaleNet. We have normalized the data model, begun the process of correcting invalid data, upgraded the user interface, and added online administrative tools. These improvements make ScaleNet easier to use and maintain and make the ScaleNet data more accurate and extendable.Database URL:http://scalenet.info	2016-02-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000370927600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630093/ScaleNet-a-literature-based-model-of-scale-insect	10.1093/database/bav118	16449374,12221039,22837851	http://scalenet.info,https://www.djangoproject.com,https://www.sqlite.org,http://httpd.apache.org,http://www.catalogueoflife.org,http://resolver.globalnames.biodinfo.org,http://www.gbif.org,http://www.discoverlife.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	ScaleNet	http://scalenet.info	NULL

Being a principle building block in macromolecular assemblies and pathways, the interactions underlie most of cellular functions. Malfunctioning of macromolecular interactions is also linked to a number of diseases. Structural knowledge of the macromolecular interaction allows one to understand the interaction’s mechanism, determine its functional implications and characterize the effects of genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, on the interaction. Unfortunately, until now the interactions mediated by different types of macromolecules, e.g. protein–protein interactions or protein–DNA interactions, are collected into individual and unrelated structural databases. This presents a significant obstacle in the analysis of macromolecular interactions. For instance, the homogeneous structural interaction databases prevent scientists from studying structural interactions of different types but occurring in the same macromolecular complex. Here, we introduce DOMMINO 2.0, a structural Database Of Macro-Molecular INteractiOns. Compared to DOMMINO 1.0, a comprehensive database on protein-protein interactions, DOMMINO 2.0 includes the interactions between all three basic types of macromolecules extracted from PDB files. DOMMINO 2.0 is automatically updated on a weekly basis. It currently includes ∼1 040 000 interactions between two polypeptide subunits (e.g. domains, peptides, termini and interdomain linkers), ∼43 000 RNA-mediated interactions, and ∼12 000 DNA-mediated interactions. All protein structures in the database are annotated using SCOP and SUPERFAMILY family annotation. As a result, protein-mediated interactions involving protein domains, interdomain linkers, C- and N- termini, and peptides are identified. Our database provides an intuitive web interface, allowing one to investigate interactions at three different resolution levels: whole subunit network, binary interaction and interaction interface.Database URL:http://dommino.org	2016-01-30	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav114%2f2630092%2fDOMMINO-2-0-integrating-structurally-resolved	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2630092/DOMMINO-2-0-integrating-structurally-resolved	10.1093/database/bav114	15193311,18381899,15993577,12600935,17406634,10937989,12242451,9787643,17112313,20965963,21113022,17135199,23599502,15353450,19880386,15657096,15749693,16381874,17202171,22135305,17397251,18000004,21097779,19920124,19357098,1384741,21071426,11044450,11859027,10679375,9094134,15381419,20360609,11024181,12538906,21840981,15643449,15980469,21822272,17098927,10592239,12488102,15369374,17851740,10026283,21638687,18318657,22002942,18204058,20140189,22252508,24784581,11125122	http://dommino.org,http://www.jmol.org	NULL	NULL	DOMMINO	http://dommino.org	NULL

Unfortunately, the increasing market demand towards virgin olive oil could often result in its adulteration with less expensive oils, which is a serious problem for the public and quality control evaluators of virgin olive oil. Therefore, to avoid frauds, olive cultivar identification and virgin olive oil authentication have become a major issue for the producers and consumers of quality control in the olive chain. Presently, genetic traceability using SSR is the cost effective and powerful marker technique that can be employed to resolve such problems. However, to identify an unknown monovarietal virgin olive oil cultivar, a reference system has become necessary. Thus, an Olive Genetic Diversity Database (OGDD) (http://www.bioinfo-cbs.org/ogdd/) is presented in this work. It is a genetic, morphologic and chemical database of worldwide olive tree and oil having a double function. In fact, besides being a reference system generated for the identification of unkown olive or virgin olive oil cultivars based on their microsatellite allele size(s), it provides users additional morphological and chemical information for each identified cultivar. Currently, OGDD is designed to enable users to easily retrieve and visualize biologically important information (SSR markers, and olive tree and oil characteristics of about 200 cultivars worldwide) using a set of efficient query interfaces and analysis tools. It can be accessed through a web service from any modern programming language using a simple hypertext transfer protocol call.

Prior approaches in development of Short Tandem Repeats (STR) markers were time consuming and inefficient. Recent methods invoking the development of STR markers using whole genomic or transcriptomics data has gained wide importance with immense potential in developing breeding and cultivator improvement approaches. Availability of whole genome sequences andin silicoapproaches has revolutionized bulk marker discovery. We report world’s first sugarbeet whole genome marker discovery having 145 K markers along with 5 K functional domain markers unified in common platform using MySQL, Apache and PHP inSBMDb. Embedded markers and corresponding location information can be selected for desired chromosome, location/interval and primers can be generated using Primer3 core, integrated at backend. Our analyses revealed abundance of ‘mono’ repeat (76.82%) over ‘di’ repeats (13.68%). Highest density (671.05 markers/Mb) was found in chromosome 1 and lowest density (341.27 markers/Mb) in chromosome 6. Current investigation of sugarbeet genome marker density has direct implications in increasing mapping marker density. This will enable present linkage map having marker distance of ∼2 cM, i.e. from 200 to 2.6 Kb, thus facilitating QTL/gene mapping. We also report e-PCR-based detection of 2027 polymorphic markers in panel of five genotypes. These markers can be used for DUS test of variety identification and MAS/GAS in variety improvement program. The present database presents wide source of potential markers for developing and implementing new approaches for molecular breeding required to accelerate industrious use of this crop, especially for sugar, health care products, medicines and color dye. Identified markers will also help in improvement of bioenergy trait of bioethanol and biogas production along with reaping advantage of crop efficiency in terms of low water and carbon footprint especially in era of climate change.Database URL:http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/sbmdb/	2015-12-07	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav111%2f2433242%2fSBMDb-first-whole-genome-putative-microsatellite	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433242/SBMDb-first-whole-genome-putative-microsatellite	10.1093/database/bav111	24352233,16603311,15321791,9380524,23531083,17333102,22775355,22211633,25302600,21083898,20668018,9149949,11675596,21951788,8020964,24203202,24047500,20482800,23316112,17577195,12411608,19054556,10688140,22246381,18348251,15712235,12669798,23794939,12835933,23633531,22214433	http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/sbmdb/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000511025.1#/st,http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,http://www.plantgdb.org/,http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/download/est_trimmer.pl,http://bvseq.molgen.mpg.de/,http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/sbmdb/,http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/sbmdb/	NULL	NULL	SBMDb	http://webapp.cabgrid.res.in/sbmdb/	database

The genomes of multiple organisms involved in symbiosis are rapidly being sequenced and becoming available, especially those from the microbial world. Currently, there are numerous databases that offer information on specific organisms or models, but none offer a global understanding on relationships between organisms, their interactions and capabilities within their niche, as well as their role as part of a system, in this case, their role in symbiosis. We have developed the SymbioGenomesDB as a community database resource for laboratories which intend to investigate and use information on the genetics and the genomics of organisms involved in these relationships. The ultimate goal of SymbioGenomesDB is to host and support the growing and vast symbiotic–host relationship information, to uncover the genetic basis of such associations. SymbioGenomesDB maintains a comprehensive organization of information on genomes of symbionts from diverse hosts throughout the Tree of Life, including their sequences, their metadata and their genomic features. This catalog of relationships was generated using computational tools, custom R scripts and manual integration of data available in public literature. As a highly curated and comprehensive systems database, SymbioGenomesDB provides web access to all the information of symbiotic organisms, their features and links to the central database NCBI. Three different tools can be found within the database to explore symbiosis-related organisms, their genes and their genomes. Also, we offer an orthology search for one or multiple genes in one or multiple organisms within symbiotic relationships, and every table, graph and output file is downloadable and easy to parse for further analysis. The robust SymbioGenomesDB will be constantly updated to cope with all the data being generated and included in major databases, in order to serve as an important, useful and timesaving tool.Database URL:http://symbiogenomesdb.uv.es	2015-11-25	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000366046400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433240/SymbioGenomesDB-a-database-for-the-integration-and	10.1093/database/bav109	23193283,18940862,22135293,22194640,24214961,10592173,19906735,23968559,18268509,25610432,12969510,12520025,18586942	http://symbiogenomesdb.uv.es,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,http://www.genomesonline.org/,https://img.jgi.doe.gov,http://symbiogenomesdb.uv.es,http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp,http://www.R-project.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=9&types=tttttttt	NULL	SymbioGenomesDB	http://symbiogenomesdb.uv.es	database

Robinson,Anika Oellrich,Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann	NULL	Analysis of scientific and clinical phenotypes reported in the experimental literature has been curated manually to build high-quality databases such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). However, the identification and harmonization of phenotype descriptions struggles with the diversity of human expressivity. We introduce a novel automated extraction approach called PhenoMiner that exploits full parsing and conceptual analysis. Apriori association mining is then used to identify relationships to human diseases. We applied PhenoMiner to the BMC open access collection and identified 13 636 phenotype candidates. We identified 28 155 phenotype-disorder hypotheses covering 4898 phenotypes and 1659 Mendelian disorders. Analysis showed: (i) the semantic distribution of the extracted terms against linked ontologies; (ii) a comparison of term overlap with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HP); (iii) moderate support for phenotype-disorder pairs in both OMIM and the literature; (iv) strong associations of phenotype-disorder pairs to known disease-genes pairs using PhenoDigm.

Previous studies on miRNA functions mainly focused on their target sites in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. However, increasing evidence has revealed that miRNAs can also induce mRNA degradation and mediate translational repression via complementary interactions with the coding sequence (CDS) and 5′UTR of mRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel database, MtiBase, to facilitate the comprehensive exploration of CDS- and 5′UTR-located miRNA target sites identified from cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-Seq) datasets and to uncover their regulatory effects on mRNA stability and translation from expression profile datasets. By integrating 61 Argonaute protein-binding CLIP-Seq datasets and miRNA target sites predicted by five commonly used programs, we identified approximately 4 400 000 CDS-located and 470 000 5′UTR-located miRNA target sites. Moreover, we evaluated the regulatory effects of miRNAs on mRNA stability and translation using the data from 222 gene expression profiles, and 28 ribosome-protected fragment sequencing, and six pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in culture. Finally, the effects of SNPs on the functions of miRNA target sites were systematically evaluated. Our study provides a useful tool for functional studies of miRNAs in regulating physiology and pathology.Database URL:http://mtibase.sysu.edu.cn	2015-10-21	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000363707900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433233/MtiBase-a-database-for-decoding-microRNA-target	10.1093/database/bav102	17506695,19167326,19920351,24014023,20018894,19336450,18498749,21969367,20966199,18806776,21685129,19536157,21037263,20371350,19578934,18812516,25414126,23335364,25263593,18668040,19768584,25107276,11752295,24297251,19261174,14709173,16990141,23680784,24803672,24275495,25352552,16024819,25428374,17604727,17496320,18516045,19855105,24316577,15383676,20015972,19647520,18996891,25416803	http://mtibase.sysu.edu.cn,http://www.R-project.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=ttttttff	NULL	MtiBase	http://mtibase.sysu.edu.cn	database

Unfortunately this information is frequently lacking, especially for unauthorized GMOs. In addition, patent sequences are generally poorly annotated, buried in complex and extensive documentation and hard to link to the corresponding GM event. Here, we present the JRC GMO-Amplicons, a database of amplicons collected by screening public nucleotide sequence databanks byin silicodetermination of PCR amplification with reference methods for GMO analysis. The European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) provides these methods in the GMOMETHODS database to support enforcement of EU legislation and GM food/feed control. The JRC GMO-Amplicons database is composed of more than 240 000 amplicons, which can be easily accessed and screened through a web interface. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at pooling and collecting publicly available sequences related to GMOs in food and feed. The JRC GMO-Amplicons supports control laboratories in the design and assessment of GMO methods, providing inter-aliain silicoprediction of primers specificity and GM targets coverage. The new tool can assist the laboratories in the analysis of complex issues, such as the detection and identification of unauthorized GMOs. Notably, the JRC GMO-Amplicons database allows the retrieval and characterization of GMO-related sequences included in patents documentation. Finally, it can help annotating poorly described GM sequences and identifying new relevant GMO-related sequences in public databases.

Over the past decade, high-throughput technologies such as the Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays have provided new perspectives into the pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Public transcriptomic data repositories, namely Gene Expression Omnibus and curated ArrayExpress, enable researchers to conduct integrative meta-analysis; increasing the power to detect differentially regulated genes in disease and explore patterns of gene dysregulation across biologically related studies. The reliability of retrospective, large-scale integrative analyses depends on an appropriate combination of related datasets, in turn requiring detailed meta-annotations capturing the experimental setup. In most cases, we observe huge variation in compliance to defined standards for submitted metadata in public databases. Much of the information to complete, or refine meta-annotations are distributed in the associated publications. For example, tissue preparation or comorbidity information is frequently described in an article’s supplementary tables. Several value-added databases have employed additional manual efforts to overcome this limitation. However, none of these databases explicate annotations that distinguish human and animal models in neurodegeneration context. Therefore, adopting a more specific disease focus, in combination with dedicated disease ontologies, will better empower the selection of comparable studies with refined annotations to address the research question at hand. In this article, we describe the detailed development ofNeuroTransDB,a manually curated database containing metadata annotations for neurodegenerative studies. The database contains more than 20 dimensions of metadata annotations within 31 mouse, 5 rat and 45 human studies, defined in collaboration with domain disease experts.

Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs are themselves regulated by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or ‘miRNA sponges’ that contain miRNA binding sites. These competitive molecules can sequester miRNAs to prevent them interacting with their natural targets to play critical roles in various biological and pathological processes. It has become increasingly important to develop a high quality database to record and store ceRNA data to support future studies. To this end, we have established the experimentally supported miRSponge database that contains data on 599 miRNA-sponge interactions and 463 ceRNA relationships from 11 species following manual curating from nearly 1200 published articles. Database classes include endogenously generated molecules including coding genes, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, along with exogenously introduced molecules including viral RNAs and artificial engineered sponges. Approximately 70% of the interactions were identified experimentally in disease states. miRSponge provides a user-friendly interface for convenient browsing, retrieval and downloading of dataset.

Nowadays, an increasing amount of gene regulatory relationships have been documented in various databases and literature. However, to more efficiently exploit such knowledge for biomedical research and applications, it is necessary to construct a genome-wide regulatory network database to integrate the information on gene regulatory relationships that are widely scattered in many different places. Therefore, in this work, we build a knowledge-based database, named ‘RegNetwork’, of gene regulatory networks for human and mouse by collecting and integrating the documented regulatory interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes from 25 selected databases. Moreover, we also inferred and incorporated potential regulatory relationships based on transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs into RegNetwork. As a result, RegNetwork contains a comprehensive set of experimentally observed or predicted transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships, and the database framework is flexibly designed for potential extensions to include gene regulatory networks for other organisms in the future. Based on RegNetwork, we characterized the statistical and topological properties of genome-wide regulatory networks for human and mouse, we also extracted and interpreted simple yet important network motifs that involve the interplays between TF-miRNA and their targets. In summary, RegNetwork provides an integrated resource on the prior information for gene regulatory relationships, and it enables us to further investigate context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions based on domain-specific experimental data.Database URL:http://www.regnetworkweb.org	2015-09-30	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000363707000002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433227/RegNetwork-an-integrated-database-of	10.1093/database/bav095	17230196,25937810,19736561,19015660,21414478,19389730,25281301,24067414,23525069,21336338,9399800,15608156,10592173,16381825,18006571,14744438,15211354,18692474,23203989,22086963,20211142,22144687,16381900,22121220,20959295,17991681,19406924,18158296,18996891,21071411,15806104,15608248,23203871,16373484,14697198,19786497,16254242,21051339,19773334,21418653,20829833,10521342,17202159,11967538,16455747,22955619	http://www.regnetworkweb.org,http://www.regnetworkweb.org,http://thebiogrid.org/,http://www.ensembl.org,http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/,http://www.hprd.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/,http://jaspar.genereg.net/,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/,http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5/,http://www.microrna.gr/microT,http://www.microrna.org/,http://www.mirbase.org/,http://miRecords.umn.edu/miRecords,http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/,http://www.string-db.org,http://www.microrna.gr/tarbase,http://www.targetscan.org/,http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html,http://202.38.126.151/hmdd/mirna/tf/,http://rulai.cshl.edu/TRED/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://genome.ucsc.edu,http://thebiogrid.org/,http://www.ensembl.org,http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/,http://www.hprd.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/,http://jaspar.genereg.net/,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/,http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5/,http://www.microrna.gr/microT,http://www.microrna.org/,http://www.mirbase.org/,http://miRecords.umn.edu/miRecords,http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/,http://www.string-db.org,http://www.microrna.gr/tarbase,http://www.targetscan.org/,http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html,http://202.38.126.151/hmdd/mirna/tf/,http://rulai.cshl.edu/TRED/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://genome.ucsc.edu	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	RegNetwork	http://www.regnetworkweb.org	database

However, many Brassicaceae genomes have been sequenced and released after its construction. These genomes are rich resources for comparative genomics, gene annotation and functional evolutionary studies ofBrassicacrops. Therefore, we have updated BRAD to version 2.0 (V2.0). In BRAD V2.0, 11 more Brassicaceae genomes have been integrated into the database, namely those ofArabidopsis lyrata,Aethionema arabicum,Brassica oleracea,Brassica napus,Camelina sativa,Capsella rubella,Leavenworthia alabamica,Sisymbrium irioand three extremophilesSchrenkiella parvula,Thellungiella halophilaandThellungiella salsuginea. BRAD V2.0 provides plots of syntenic genomic fragments between pairs of Brassicaceae species, from the level of chromosomes to genomic blocks. The Generic Synteny Browser (GBrowse_syn), a module of the Genome Browser (GBrowse), is used to show syntenic relationships between multiple genomes. Search functions for retrieving syntenic and non-syntenic orthologs, as well as their annotation and sequences are also provided. Furthermore, genome and annotation information have been imported into GBrowse so that all functional elements can be visualized in one frame. We plan to continually update BRAD by integrating more Brassicaceae genomes into the database.Database URL:http://brassicadb.org/brad/	2015-11-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000366046300001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433225/Brassica-database-BRAD-version-2-0-integrating-and	10.1093/database/bav093	25035408,21873998,25146293,21478890,23817568,23749190,21822265,22778405,24759634,18436778,9254694,12520024,10592173,18940856,14681407,11590104,21177137,23653472,17029932,17300984	http://brassicadb.org/brad/,http://faostat.fao.org/,https://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://brassicadb.org/brad/,http://ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html,https://genomevolution.org/CoGe/,http://www.camelinadb.ca,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,https://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://brassicadb.org/brad/,http://ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html,https://genomevolution.org/CoGe/,http://www.camelinadb.ca,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://mustang.biol.mcgill.ca:8885/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://www.phytozome.net/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://brassicadb.org,http://www.brassica.info/,http://www.brassica.info/BrassEnsembl/index.html,http://brassica.nbi.ac.uk/BrassicaDB/,http://www.cropstoredb.org/,http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html	NULL	NULL	BRAD	http://brassicadb.org/brad/	database

The aim of our portal comprehensive resources for cancer NGS data analysis (CRCDA) is to provide a collection of different NGS tools and pipelines under diverse classes with cancer pathways and databases and furthermore, literature information from PubMed. The literature data was constrained to 18 most common cancer types such as breast cancer, colon cancer and other cancers that exhibit in worldwide population. NGS-cancer tools for the convenience have been categorized into cancer genomics, cancer transcriptomics, cancer epigenomics, quality control and visualization. Pipelines for variant detection, quality control and data analysis were listed to provide out-of-the box solution for NGS data analysis, which may help researchers to overcome challenges in selecting and configuring individual tools for analysing exome, whole genome and transcriptome data. An extensive search page was developed that can be queried by using (i) type of data [literature, gene data and sequence read archive (SRA) data] and (ii) type of cancer (selected based on global incidence and accessibility of data). For each category of analysis, variety of tools are available and the biggest challenge is in searching and using the right tool for the right application. The objective of the work is collecting tools in each category available at various places and arranging the tools and other data in a simple and user-friendly manner for biologists and oncologists to find information easier. To the best of our knowledge, we have collected and presented a comprehensive package of most of the resources available in cancer for NGS data analysis.

Swertz	NULL	There is an urgent need to standardize the semantics of biomedical data values, such as phenotypes, to enable comparative and integrative analyses. However, it is unlikely that all studies will use the same data collection protocols. As a result, retrospective standardization is often required, which involves matching of original (unstructured or locally coded) data to widely used coding or ontology systems such as SNOMED CT (clinical terms), ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease) and HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology). This data curation process is usually a time-consuming process performed by a human expert. To help mechanize this process, we have developed SORTA, a computer-aided system for rapidly encoding free text or locally coded values to a formal coding system or ontology. SORTA matches original data values (uploaded in semicolon delimited format) to a target coding system (uploaded in Excel spreadsheet, OWL ontology web language or OBO open biomedical ontologies format). It then semi- automatically shortlists candidate codes for each data value using Lucene and n-gram based matching algorithms, and can also learn from matches chosen by human experts. We evaluated SORTA’s applicability in two use cases. For the LifeLines biobank, we used SORTA to recode 90 000 free text values (including 5211 unique values) about physical exercise to MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) codes. For the CINEAS clinical symptom coding system, we used SORTA to map to HPO, enriching HPO when necessary (315 terms matched so far). Out of the shortlists at rank 1, we found a precision/recall of 0.97/0.98 in LifeLines and of 0.58/0.45 in CINEAS. More importantly, users found the tool both a major time saver and a quality improvement because SORTA reduced the chances of human mistakes.

At the same time, new graphical user interface-based workflow tools offer facile alternatives to custom scripting for informatics and data analysis. Here, we illustrate how the large protein-ligand database BindingDB may be incorporated into KNIME workflows as a step toward the integration of pharmacological data with broader biomolecular analyses. Thus, we describe a collection of KNIME workflows that access BindingDB data via RESTful webservices and, for more intensive queries, via a local distillation of the full BindingDB dataset. We focus in particular on the KNIME implementation of knowledge-based tools to generate informed hypotheses regarding protein targets of bioactive compounds, based on notions of chemical similarity. A number of variants of this basic approach are tested for seven existing drugs with relatively ill-defined therapeutic targets, leading to replication of some previously confirmed results and discovery of new, high-quality hits.

A tumor-specific fusion gene event may occur when a translocation joins two separate genes. Currently, various CT databases provide information about fusion genes and their genomic elements. However, no database of the roles of fusion genes, in terms of essential functional and regulatory elements in oncogenesis, is available. FARE-CAFE is a unique combination of CTs, fusion proteins, protein domains, domain–domain interactions, protein–protein interactions, transcription factors and microRNAs, with subsequent experimental information, which cannot be found in any other CT database. Genomic DNA information including, for example, manually collected exact locations of the first and second break points, sequences and karyotypes of fusion genes are included. FARE-CAFE will substantially facilitate the cancer biologist’s mission of elucidating the pathogenesis of various types of cancer.

In recent years, plethora of lncRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes through different approaches, and the researchers are constantly reporting the regulatory roles of these lncRNAs, which leads to complexity of literature about particular lncRNAs. Therefore, for the convenience of the researchers, we collected regulatory relationships of the lncRNAs and built a database called ‘LncReg’. This database is developed by collecting 1081 validated lncRNA-associated regulatory entries, including 258 non-redundant lncRNAs and 571 non-redundant genes. With regulatory relationships information, LncReg can provide overall perspectives of regulatory networks of lncRNAs and comprehensive data for bioinformatics research, which is useful for understanding the functional roles of lncRNAs.Database URL:http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/lncreg/	2015-09-10	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav083%2f2433216%2fLncReg-a-reference-resource-for-lncRNA-associated	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433216/LncReg-a-reference-resource-for-lncRNA-associated	10.1093/database/bav083	19188922,19239885,21558391,22193719,24296535,23295831,24723937,19625619,20616235,22664915,23463315,24967960,20673990,22000014,21802130,24305048,24316222,23846593,23203871,23161675,25234927,24217916,24803509,23175614,23446346,23446348,20656902,19182780,21874018,24070194,24055342,25399420,22841487	http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/lncreg/,http://www.lncrnadb.org/,http://www.lncrna2target.org/,http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttf	NULL	LncReg	http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/lncreg/	NULL

However, the combinatorial effects of these molecules in a specific biological function are poorly understood. Identifying co-expressed protein-coding genes of lncRNAs would provide ample insight into lncRNA functions. To facilitate such an effort, we have developed Co-LncRNA, which is a web-based computational tool that allows users to identify GO annotations and KEGG pathways that may be affected by co-expressed protein-coding genes of a single or multiple lncRNAs. LncRNA co-expressed protein-coding genes were first identified in publicly available human RNA-Seq datasets, including 241 datasets across 6560 total individuals representing 28 tissue types/cell lines. Then, the lncRNA combinatorial effects in a given GO annotations or KEGG pathways are taken into account by the simultaneous analysis of multiple lncRNAs in user-selected individual or multiple datasets, which is realized by enrichment analysis. In addition, this software provides a graphical overview of pathways that are modulated by lncRNAs, as well as a specific tool to display the relevant networks between lncRNAs and their co-expressed protein-coding genes. Co-LncRNA also supports users in uploading their own lncRNA and protein-coding gene expression profiles to investigate the lncRNA combinatorial effects. It will be continuously updated with more human RNA-Seq datasets on an annual basis. Taken together, Co-LncRNA provides a web-based application for investigating lncRNA combinatorial effects, which could shed light on their biological roles and could be a valuable resource for this community.Database URL:http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA/	2015-09-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361056200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433215/Co-LncRNA-investigating-the-lncRNA-combinatorial	10.1093/database/bav082	25378313,22955987,24285305,21890647,23818866,23498938,24296535,23498939,25332394,22337053,23463315,10592235,24297251,24813212,25399422,9843981,15173114,23583100,21715382,25707511,24809982,24522499,24429633,23193258,19289445,20436464,21816040,22955988,23243023,23555285,24853421	http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA/,http://www/cancergenome.nih.gov/,http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/22.html,http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=10&types=bttttttf	NULL	Co-LncRNA	http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA/	NULL

Today, microbial rhodopsin research is a flourishing research field in which new understandings of rhodopsin diversity, function and evolution are contributing to broader microbiological and molecular knowledge. Here, we describe MicRhoDE, a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible database that facilitates analysis of the diversity and evolution of microbial rhodopsins. Rhodopsin sequences isolated from a vast array of marine and terrestrial environments were manually collected and curated. To each rhodopsin sequence are associated related metadata, including predicted spectral tuning of the protein, putative activity and function, taxonomy for sequences that can be linked to a 16S rRNA gene, sampling date and location, and supporting literature. The database currently covers 7857 aligned sequences from more than 450 environmental samples or organisms. Based on a robust phylogenetic analysis, we introduce an operational classification system with multiple phylogenetic levels ranging from superclusters to species-level operational taxonomic units. An integrated pipeline for online sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction is also provided. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, this unique resource should be highly valuable for upcoming studies of the biogeography, diversity, distribution and evolution of microbial rhodopsins.Database URL:http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr.	2015-08-18	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361055500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433213/MicRhoDE-a-curated-database-for-the-analysis-of	10.1093/database/bav080	16063250,2252905,10988064,16482157,18369329,21883799,20601510,14510837,23036091,23754728,12206764,12682005,18475306,23051692,15305915,15001713,16008504,17355176,18211270,18218036,19242530,19502441,20305030,15170485,9168108,23564032,15045490,23292138,17008099,12483616,14985472,18043613,11969395,19860910,16169926,20738864,21034504	http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr,http://camera.crbs.ucsd.edu/,http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr,http://www.catalystframework.org/,http://www.postgresql.org/,http://webtools.sb-roscoff.fr/root?tool_id=abims_micrhode_workflow,http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy.html#	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=tttttttw	NULL	MicRhoDE	http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr	database

MetazSecKB is a secretome and subcellular proteome knowledgebase specifically designed for metazoan, i.e. human and animals. The protein sequence data, consisting of over 4 million entries with 121 species having a complete proteome, were retrieved from UniProtKB. Protein subcellular locations including secreted and 15 other subcellular locations were assigned based on either curated experimental evidence or prediction using seven computational tools. The protein or subcellular proteome data can be searched and downloaded using several different types of identifiers, gene name or keyword(s), and species. BLAST search and community annotation of subcellular locations are also supported. Our primary analysis revealed that the proteome sizes, secretome sizes and other subcellular proteome sizes vary tremendously in different animal species. The proportions of secretomes vary from 3 to 22% (average 8%) in metazoa species.The proportions of other major subcellular proteomes ranged approximately 21–43% (average 31%) in cytoplasm, 20–37% (average 30%) in nucleus, 3–19% (average 12%) as plasma membrane proteins and 3–9% (average 6%) in mitochondria. We also compared the protein families in secretomes of different primates.

However, future attempts of engineeringS. cerevisiae’s metabolism using synthetic biology need to move towards more integrative models that incorporate the high connectivity of metabolic pathways and regulatory processes and the interactions in genetic elements across those pathways and processes. To contribute in this direction, we have developedMetabolicEngineering targetSelection and bestStrainIdentification tool (MESSI), a web server for predicting efficient chassis and regulatory components for yeast bio-based production. The server provides an integrative platform for users to analyse ready-to-use public high-throughput metabolomic data, which are transformed to metabolic pathway activities for identifying the most efficientS. cerevisiaestrain for the production of a compound of interest. As input MESSI accepts metabolite KEGG IDs or pathway names. MESSI outputs a ranked list ofS. cerevisiaestrains based on aggregation algorithms. Furthermore, through a genome-wide association study of the metabolic pathway activities with the strains’ natural variation, MESSI prioritizes genes and small variants as potential regulatory points and promising metabolic engineering targets. Users can choose various parameters in the whole process such as (i) weight and expectation of each metabolic pathway activity in the final ranking of the strains, (ii) Weighted AddScore Fuse or Weighted Borda Fuse aggregation algorithm, (iii) type of variants to be included, (iv) variant sets in different biological levels.Database URL:http://sbb.hku.hk/MESSI/	2015-08-08	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav076%2f2433209%2fMESSI-metabolic-engineering-target-selection-and	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433209/MESSI-metabolic-engineering-target-selection-and	10.1093/database/bav076	22388689,23504077,23541504,23611565,23656228,23720455,20080505,21478889,20644199,22728672,20929912,10592173,25665008,18385116,15297300,22110037,25461829,24752690,12972620,11816029,17482543,12062417,23631471,23555215,15608231	http://sbb.hku.hk/MESSI/,http://www.R-project.org/,http://shiny.rstudio.com	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=5&types=tttttttt	NULL	MESSI	http://sbb.hku.hk/MESSI/	NULL

This database has been created in conjunction with the NNTC, which provides human tissue and biofluid samples to individual researchers to conduct studies focused on neuroAIDS. The database contains experimental datasets from 1206 subjects for the following categories (which are further broken down into subcategories): gene expression, genotype, proteins, endo-exo-chemicals, morphometrics and other (miscellaneous) data. The database also contains a wide variety of downloadable data and metadata for 95 HIV-related studies covering 170 assays from 61 principal investigators. The data represent 76 tissue types, 25 measurement types, and 38 technology types, and reaches a total of 33 017 407 data points. We used the ISA platform to create the database and develop a searchable web interface for querying the data.

Privitera,Rosario Distefano,Hugo A. Wefer,Alfredo Ferro,Alfredo Pulvirenti,Rosalba Giugno	NULL	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by intrusive and unwilling thoughts (obsessions) giving rise to anxiety. The patients feel obliged to perform a behavior (compulsions) induced by the obsessions. The World Health Organization ranks OCD as one of the 10 most disabling medical conditions. In the class of Anxiety Disorders, OCD is a pathology that shows an hereditary component. Consequently, an online resource collecting and integrating scientific discoveries and genetic evidence about OCD would be helpful to improve the current knowledge on this disorder. We have developed a manually curated database, OCD Database (OCDB), collecting the relations between candidate genes in OCD, microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the pathophysiology of OCD and drugs used in its treatments. We have screened articles from PubMed and MEDLINE. For each gene, the bibliographic references with a brief description of the gene and the experimental conditions are shown. The database also lists the polymorphisms within genes and its chromosomal regions. OCDB data is enriched with both validated and predicted miRNA-target and drug-target information. The transcription factors regulations, which are also included, are taken from David and TransmiR. Moreover, a scoring function ranks the relevance of data in the OCDB context. The database is also integrated with the main online resources (PubMed, Entrez-gene, HGNC, dbSNP, DrugBank, miRBase, PubChem, Kegg, Disease-ontology and ChEBI). The web interface has been developed using phpMyAdmin and Bootstrap software. This allows (i) to browse data by category and (ii) to navigate in the database by searching genes, miRNAs, drugs, SNPs, regions, drug targets and articles. The data can be exported in textual format as well as the whole database in.sql or tabular format. OCDB is an essential resource to support genome-wide analysis, genetic and pharmacological studies. It also facilitates the evaluation of genetic data in OCD and the detection of alternative treatments.Database URL:http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/ocdb/	2015-07-29	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361055100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433202/OCDB-a-database-collecting-genes-miRNAs-and-drugs	10.1093/database/bav069	15677583,16612185,9493948,11691698,1461792,15939837,24616177,6399751,12116192,15272418,10768697,15892140,15635694,10960159,11690590,11578982,11317217,16818866,14530974,17726913,23970845,9672904,22727904,10793323,15005715,18616610,23990902,19119093,23150170,19370765,18949648,20623923,21443448,23094178,2684084,12438481,21115458,11810281,11125122,16407331,19033363,19786497,24214961,17932057,14697198,23720490,25617670,9800217,21168126,18305461,15610960,11822995,18639233,15094841,24669207,20847275	http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/ocdb/,http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/ocdb/,http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/ocdb/,http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/I20-I25	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttfff	NULL	OCDB	http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/ocdb/	database

Rather, covalent modifications of DNA and histones affect gene expression and genome stabilityviaproteins that recognize and act upon such modifications. Many enzymes that catalyse epigenetic modifications or are critical for enzymatic complexes have been discovered, and this is encouraging investigators to study the role of these proteins in diverse normal and pathological processes. Rapidly growing knowledge in the area has resulted in the need for a resource that compiles, organizes and presents curated information to the researchers in an easily accessible and user-friendly form. Here we present EpiFactors, a manually curated database providing information about epigenetic regulators, their complexes, targets and products. EpiFactors contains information on 815 proteins, including 95 histones and protamines. For 789 of these genes, we include expressions values across several samples, in particular a collection of 458 human primary cell samples (for approximately 200 cell types, in many cases from three individual donors), covering most mammalian cell steady states, 255 different cancer cell lines (representing approximately 150 cancer subtypes) and 134 human postmortem tissues. Expression values were obtained by the FANTOM5 consortium using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression technique. EpiFactors also contains information on 69 protein complexes that are involved in epigenetic regulation. The resource is practical for a wide range of users, including biologists, pharmacologists and clinicians.Database URL:http://epifactors.autosome.ru	2015-07-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361053800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433200/EpiFactors-a-comprehensive-database-of-human	10.1093/database/bav067	NULL	http://epifactors.autosome.ru	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=tttttttt	NULL	EpiFactors	http://epifactors.autosome.ru	database

There are on-going efforts to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the stage transition process via the application of high-throughput epigenomics, genomics and proteomics techniques. Given the range of experimental conditions and the typical yield from such high-throughput techniques, a new challenge arises: how to effectively collect, organize and disseminate the generated data for subsequent data analysis. Here, we describe toxoMine, which provides a powerful interface to support sophisticated integrative exploration of high-throughput experimental data and metadata, providing researchers with a more tractable means toward understanding how genetic and/or epigenetic factors play a coordinated role in determining pathogenicity ofT. gondii. As a data warehouse, toxoMine allows integration of high-throughput data sets with publicT. gondiidata. toxoMine is also able to execute complex queries involving multiple data sets with straightforward user interaction. Furthermore, toxoMine allows users to define their own parameters during the search process that gives users near-limitless search and query capabilities. The interoperability feature also allows users to query and examine data available in other InterMine systems, which would effectively augment the search scope beyond what is available to toxoMine. toxoMine complements the major community database ToxoDB by providing a data warehouse that enables more extensive integrative studies forT. gondii. Given all these factors, we believe it will become an indispensable resource to the greater infectious disease research community.Database URL:http://toxomine.org	2015-06-30	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361053200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433199/toxoMine-an-integrated-omics-data-warehouse-for	10.1093/database/bav066	20109158,24327343,22480826,24391497,21483487,12455982,25393307,21177974,21177976,21856757,23023984,15892872,23652793,17615057,24324765,23935057,22121219,22080565,21408081,22434830,18003657,20522451,17142230,17202162,12952885,10802651,24753429	http://toxomine.org,http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml,http://tomcat.apache.org,http://www.cpan.org,http://pypi.python.org,http://rubygems.org,http://intermine.readthedocs.org,http://modENCODE.org,http://toxodb.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=17&types=bbtttttf	NULL	toxoMine	http://toxomine.org	NULL

Durand,Scott Hazelhurst	NULL	The evolutionary rate at codon sites across protein-coding nucleotide sequences represents a valuable tier of information for aligning sequences, inferring homology and constructing phylogenetic profiles. However, a comprehensive resource for cataloguing the evolutionary rate at codon sites and their corresponding nucleotide and protein domain sequence alignments has not been developed. To address this gap in knowledge, EvoDB (an Evolutionary rates DataBase) was compiled. Nucleotide sequences and their corresponding protein domain data including the associated seed alignments from the PFAM-A (protein family) database were used to estimate evolutionary rate (ω = dN/dS) profiles at codon sites for each entry. EvoDB contains 98.83% of the gapped nucleotide sequence alignments and 97.1% of the evolutionary rate profiles for the corresponding information in PFAM-A. As the identification of codon sites under positive selection and their position in a sequence profile is usually the most sought after information for molecular evolutionary biologists, evolutionary rate profiles were determined under the M2a model using the CODEML algorithm in the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) suite of software. Validation of nucleotide sequences against amino acid data was implemented to ensure high data quality. EvoDB is a catalogue of the evolutionary rate profiles and provides the corresponding phylogenetic trees, PFAM-A alignments and annotated accession identifier data. In addition, the database can be explored and queried using known evolutionary rate profiles to identify domains under similar evolutionary constraints and pressures. EvoDB is a resource for evolutionary, phylogenetic studies and presents a tier of information untapped by current databases.Database URL:http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/fire/evodb	2015-07-02	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav065%2f2433198%2fEvoDB-a-database-of-evolutionary-rate-profiles	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433198/EvoDB-a-database-of-evolutionary-rate-profiles	10.1093/database/bav065	15689528,17483113,15509596,11018152,18997863,22127870,16381879,24253303,22144687,20334658,10827456,20224823	http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/fire/evodb,http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/fire/evodb	NULL	NULL	EvoDB	http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/fire/evodb	database

To accelerate the identification and functional understanding of T3SEs, we present BEAN 2.0 as an integrated web resource to predict, analyse and store T3SEs. BEAN 2.0 includes three major components. First, it provides an accurate T3SE predictor based on a hybrid approach. Using independent testing data, we show that BEAN 2.0 achieves a sensitivity of 86.05% and a specificity of 100%. Second, it integrates a set of online sequence analysis tools. Users can further perform functional analysis of putative T3SEs in a seamless way, such as subcellular location prediction, functional domain scan and disorder region annotation. Third, it compiles a database covering 1215 experimentally verified T3SEs and constructs two T3SE-related networks that can be used to explore the relationships among T3SEs. Taken together, by presenting a one-stop T3SE bioinformatics resource, we hope BEAN 2.0 can promote comprehensive understanding of the function and evolution of T3SEs.Database URL:http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/bean/	2015-06-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361052900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433197/BEAN-2-0-an-integrated-web-resource-for-the	10.1093/database/bav064	17136086,19527884,19404331,21111231,21517912,17303758,17040127,24038649,22425230,22341410,21799664,19390620,19390696,19526054,20122221,21233168,23437191,23472154,24391954,21106126,21071416,22545727,18293306,15720547,15686835,17768243,16849798,16339140,20601478,16990433,23193298,17446895,18274516,24288371,15955779,17140285,16728640	http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/bean/,http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL	BEAN	http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/bean/	NULL

A simple, regular motif was originally proposed to describe G4-forming sequences. More recently, however, formation of G4 was discovered to depend, at least in part, on the contextual backdrop of neighboring sequences. Prediction of G4 folding is thus becoming more challenging as G4 outlier structures, not described by the originally proposed motif, are increasingly reported. Recent observations thus call for a comprehensive tool, capable of consolidating the expanding information on tested G4s, in order to conduct systematic comparative analyses of G4-promoting sequences. The G4RNA Database we propose was designed to help meet the need for easily-retrievable data on known RNA G4s. A user-friendly, flexible query system allows for data retrieval on experimentally tested sequences, from many separate genes, to assess G4-folding potential.

However, the pathways curated in most of these databases are drug-action or drug-metabolism pathways. In recent years, high-throughput technologies such as microarray and RNA-sequencing have produced lots of drug-induced gene expression profiles. Interestingly, drug-induced gene expression profile frequently show distinct patterns, indicating that drugs normally induce the activation or repression of distinct pathways. Therefore, these pathways contribute to study the mechanisms of drugs and drug-repurposing. Here, we present Drug-Path, a database of drug-induced pathways, which was generated by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for drug-induced upregulated genes and downregulated genes based on drug-induced gene expression datasets in Connectivity Map. Drug-Path provides user-friendly interfaces to retrieve, visualize and download the drug-induced pathway data in the database. In addition, the genes deregulated by a given drug are highlighted in the pathways. All data were organized using SQLite. The web site was implemented using Django, a Python web framework.

Drought is the major abiotic stress restricting plant growth worldwide. A number of genes involved in drought stress response have already been characterized, mainly in the model speciesArabidopsis thalianaandOryza sativa.However, with the aim to produce drought tolerant crop varieties, it is of importance to identify the respective orthologs for each species. We have developed DroughtDB, a manually curated compilation of molecularly characterized genes that are involved in drought stress response. DroughtDB includes information about the originally identified gene, its physiological and/or molecular function and mutant phenotypes and provides detailed information about computed orthologous genes in nine model and crop plant species including maize and barley. All identified orthologs are interlinked with the respective reference entry in MIPS/PGSB PlantsDB, which allows retrieval of additional information like genome context and sequence information. Thus, DroughtDB is a valuable resource and information tool for researchers working on drought stress and will facilitate the identification, analysis and characterization of genes involved in drought stress tolerance in agriculturally important crop plants.Database URL:http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/droughtdb/	2015-05-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361051200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433179/DroughtDB-an-expert-curated-compilation-of-plant	10.1093/database/bav046	12234732,16441347,22118614,11006305,20002333,23573074,19841686,23314754,19189423,19965430,20148030,22660326,23075845,23535592,24104565,19033550,12952885,12221975,23203886,8703061,9765153,12119381,16045476,23364940,24068300	http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/droughtdb/,http://orthomcl.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	DroughtDB	http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/droughtdb/	NULL

However, most studies and available resources such as Gene Ontology provide only gene-level function annotations, and therefore lose the differential information at the isoform level. Here we report MIsoMine, a high-resolution portal to multiple levels of functional information of alternatively spliced isoforms in the mouse. This data portal provides tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression networks, along with such previously published functional genomic data as protein domains, predicted isoform-level functions and functional relationships. The core utility of MIsoMine is allowing users to explore a preprocessed, quality-controlled set of RNA-seq data encompassing diverse tissues and cell lineages. Tissue-specific co-expression networks were established, allowing a 2D ranking of isoforms and tissues by co-expression patterns. The results of the multiple isoforms of the same gene are presented in parallel to facilitate direct comparison, with cross-talking to prioritized functions at the isoform level. MIsoMine provides the first isoform-level resolution effort at genome-scale. We envision that this data portal will be a valuable resource for exploring functional genomic data, and will complement the existing functionalities of the mouse genome informatics database and the gene expression database for the laboratory mouse.Database URL:http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/misomine/	2015-05-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361050200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433177/MIsoMine-a-genome-scale-high-resolution-data	10.1093/database/bav045	24802673,24951248,18978772,18613947,18613949,19728866,18613946,19289445,22383036,17724061,15608255,15741514,20379172,18818725,24259432,24288371,24244129,25265570,22684505,21085640,23028291,24163257,22345621,23161672,21062823,25115705,24919880	http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/misomine/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=8&types=bbbbtttt	NULL	MIsoMine	http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/misomine/	NULL

Rennert,Wai-Yee Chan,Tin-Lap Lee	NULL	Spermatogenic failure is a major cause of male infertility, which affects millions of couples worldwide. Recent discovery of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as critical regulators in normal and disease development provides new clues for delineating the molecular regulation in male germ cell development. However, few functional lncRNAs have been characterized to date. A major limitation in studying lncRNA in male germ cell development is the absence of germ cell-specific lncRNA annotation. Current lncRNA annotations are assembled by transcriptome data from heterogeneous tissue sources; specific germ cell transcript information of various developmental stages is therefore under-represented, which may lead to biased prediction or fail to identity important germ cell-specific lncRNAs. GermlncRNA provides the first comprehensive web-based and open-access lncRNA catalogue for three key male germ cell stages, including type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. This information has been developed by integrating male germ transcriptome resources derived from RNA-Seq, tiling microarray and GermSAGE. Characterizations on lncRNA-associated regulatory features, potential coding gene and microRNA targets are also provided. Search results from GermlncRNA can be exported to Galaxy for downstream analysis or downloaded locally. Taken together, GermlncRNA offers a new avenue to better understand the role of lncRNAs and associated targets during spermatogenesis.Database URL:http://germlncrna.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/	2015-05-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361051400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433176/GermlncRNA-a-unique-catalogue-of-long-non-coding	10.1093/database/bav044	18439586,1757519,18832368,20028690,15533714,19306351,16678385,16458478,22144240,24415997,24115003,23756463,24713396,24829860,25101115,23498938,24970022,23990798,20577206,24320048,24910706,21963238,1772416,24048575,25097017,24130740,24285305,11752248,22955988,21622663,21890647,24429298,22144238,23791531,23759713,22383036,17130148,16500937,17099231,23335781,24215113,7570003,20003500,19033363,19131956,17893677,23161675,20738864,17919331,20930520,24072616,18974356,18988810,21307942,18587408,22000013,23541921,19068231,17442854,17571346,16141072,25124853,21802130	http://germlncrna.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/,http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables,http://www.noncode.org,http://www.ncrna.org/frnadb,http://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html,http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase/lncrna.php,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena,http://www.noncode.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo,http://germsage.nichd.nih.gov/germsage/home.html,http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/,http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/index.html,https://usegalaxy.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	GermlncRNA	http://germlncrna.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/	NULL

AtmiRNET is a novel resource geared toward plant scientists for reconstructing regulatory networks ofArabidopsismiRNAs. By means of highlighted miRNA studies in target recognition, functional enrichment of target genes, promoter identification and detection ofcis-andtrans-elements, AtmiRNET allows users to explore mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and miRNA functions inArabidopsis thaliana, which are rarely investigated so far. High-throughput next-generation sequencing datasets from transcriptional start sites (TSSs)-relevant experiments as well as five core promoter elements were collected to establish the support vector machine-based prediction model forArabidopsismiRNA TSSs. Then, high-confidence transcription factors participate in transcriptional regulation ofArabidopsismiRNAs are provided based on statistical approach. Furthermore, both experimentally verified and putative miRNA-target interactions, whose validity was supported by the correlations between the expression levels of miRNAs and their targets, are elucidated for functional enrichment analysis. The inferred regulatory networks give users an intuitive insight into the pivotal roles ofArabidopsismiRNAs through the crosstalk between miRNA transcriptional regulation (upstream) and miRNA-mediate (downstream) gene circuits.

All the entries in NeuroPep have been manually checked. 2069 of the 5949 (35%) neuropeptide sequences were collected from the scientific literature. Moreover, NeuroPep contains detailed annotations for each entry, including source organisms, tissue specificity, families, names, post-translational modifications, 3D structures (if available) and literature references.

The third generation of proteomics was provoked to bridge this gap. Targeted and untargeted post-translational modification (PTM) studies are the most important parts of today’s proteomics. Considering the expensive and time-consuming nature of experimental methods, computational methods are developed to study, analyze, predict, count and compute the PTM annotations on proteins. The enrichment analysis softwares are among the common computational biology and bioinformatic software packages. The focus of such softwares is to find the probability of occurrence of the desired biological features in any arbitrary list of genes/proteins. We introduce Post-translational modification Enrichment Integration and Matching Analysis (PEIMAN) software to explore more probable and enriched PTMs on proteins. Here, we also represent the statistics of detected PTM terms used in enrichment analysis in PEIMAN software based on the latest released version of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. These results, in addition to giving insight to any given list of proteins, could be useful to design targeted PTM studies for identification and characterization of special chemical groups.Database URL:http://bs.ipm.ir/softwares/PEIMAN/	2015-04-23	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361048800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433169/PEIMAN-1-0-Post-translational-modification	10.1093/database/bav037	12610558,22884395,22311636,15113093,11891116,11057893,19666874,20103568,22037311,15174124,20631208,23193284,24705204,25361965,19366988,19176546,19033363,24253303,15972284,15174126,15174125,24234447,22355520	http://bs.ipm.ir/softwares/PEIMAN/,http://bs.ipm.ir/softwares/PEIMAN/,http://uniprot.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=ttttttff	NULL	PEIMAN	http://bs.ipm.ir/softwares/PEIMAN/	NULL

Pisano	NULL	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding elements involved in the post-transcriptional down-regulation of gene expression through base pairing with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Through this mechanism, several miRNA–mRNA pairs have been described as critical in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including early embryonic development and pathological conditions. Many of these pairs (such as miR-15 b/BCL2 in apoptosis or BART-6/BCL6 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas) were experimentally discovered and/or computationally predicted. Available tools for target prediction are usually based on sequence matching, thermodynamics and conservation, among other approaches. Nevertheless, the main issue on miRNA–mRNA pair prediction is the little overlapping results among different prediction methods, or even with experimentally validated pairs lists, despite the fact that all rely on similar principles. To circumvent this problem, we have developed miRGate, a database containing novel computational predicted miRNA–mRNA pairs that are calculated using well-established algorithms. In addition, it includes an updated and complete dataset of sequences for both miRNA and mRNAs 3′-Untranslated region from human (including human viruses), mouse and rat, as well as experimentally validated data from four well-known databases. The underlying methodology of miRGate has been successfully applied to independent datasets providing predictions that were convincingly validated by functional assays. miRGate is an open resource available athttp://mirgate.bioinfo.cnio.es.

Recently, phosphorylation in prokaryotes attracted much attention for its critical roles in various cellular processes such as signal transduction. Thus, an integrative data resource of the prokaryotic phosphorylation will be useful for further analysis. In this study, we presented a curated database of phosphorylation sites in prokaryotes (dbPSP, Database URL:http://dbpsp.biocuckoo.org) for 96 prokaryotic organisms, which belong to 11 phyla in two domains including bacteria and archaea. From the scientific literature, we manually collected experimentally identified phosphorylation sites on seven types of residues, including serine, threonine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, histidine, cysteine and arginine. In total, the dbPSP database contains 7391 phosphorylation sites in 3750 prokaryotic proteins. With the dataset, the sequence preferences of the phosphorylation sites and functional annotations of the phosphoproteins were analyzed, while the results shows that there were obvious differences among the phosphorylation in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. All the phosphorylation sites were annotated with original references and other descriptions in the database, which could be easily accessed through user-friendly website interface including various search and browse options.

Therefore, bioremediation through surfactants mobilization or biodegradation is an important subject, both economically and environmentally. Bioremediation research had a great boost with the recent advances in Metagenomics, as it enabled the sequencing of uncultured microorganisms providing new insights on surfactant-producing and/or oil-degrading bacteria. Many research studies are making available genomic data from unknown organisms obtained from metagenomics analysis of oil-contaminated environmental samples. These new datasets are presently demanding the development of new tools and data repositories tailored for the biological analysis in a context of bioremediation data analysis.

The striking ability to survive several stresses usually used for food preservation makesL. monocytogenesone of the biggest concerns to the food industry, while the high mortality of listeriosis in specific groups of humans makes it a great concern for public health. Previous studies have shown that a regulatory network involving alternative sigma (σ) factors and transcription factors is pivotal to stress survival. However, few studies have evaluated at the metabolic networks controlled by these regulatory mechanisms. TheL. monocytogenesBioCyc database uses the strain 10403S as a model. Computer-generated initial annotation for all genes also allowed for identification, annotation and display of predicted reactions and pathways carried out by a single cell. Further ongoing manual curation based on published data as well as database mining for selected genes allowed the more refined annotation of functions, which, in turn, allowed for annotation of new pathways and fine-tuning of previously defined pathways to moreL. monocytogenes-specific pathways. Using RNA-Seq data, several transcription start sites and promoter regions were mapped to the 10403S genome and annotated within the database.

Blundell	NULL	Tuberculosis kills more than a million people annually and presents increasingly high levels of resistance against current first line drugs. Structural information aboutMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) proteins is a valuable asset for the development of novel drugs and for understanding the biology of the bacterium; however, only about 10% of the ∼4000 proteins have had their structures determined experimentally. The CHOPIN database assigns structural domains and generates homology models for 2911 sequences, corresponding to ∼73% of the proteome. A sophisticated pipeline allows multiple models to be created using conformational states characteristic of different oligomeric states and ligand binding, such that the models reflect various functional states of the proteins. Additionally, CHOPIN includes structural analyses of mutations potentially associated with drug resistance. Results are made available at the web interface, which also serves as an automatically updated repository of all published Mtb experimental structures. Its RESTful interface allows direct and flexible access to structures and metadata via intuitive URLs, enabling easy programmatic use of the models.Database URL:http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/chopin	2015-03-31	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361047800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433158/CHOPIN-a-web-resource-for-the-structural-and	10.1093/database/bav026	9634230,12368430,21674801,23287603,22073123,7723011,11875032,9051729,20354512,24281696,20847218,16731699,11419950,2181150,23868908,17379688,23329690,22039361,16777907,11790853,17905832,16751606,23780644,19890396,17341496,23396119,20980199,9730927,17373362,21283666,25467293,25155596,23266261,23332402	http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/chopin,http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/,http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/toccata,http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/chopin/,http://www.tbdb.org,http://tuberculist.epfl.ch,http://www.webtb.org,http://www.uniprot.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=ttttttff	NULL	CHOPIN	http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/chopin	NULL

Cox	NULL	Functional annotation of genetic variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNV) promises to greatly improve our understanding of human complex traits. Previous transcriptomic studies involving individuals from different global populations have investigated the genetic architecture of gene expression variation by mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Functional interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has identified enrichment of eQTL in top signals from GWAS of human complex traits. The SCAN (SNP and CNV Annotation) database was developed as a web-based resource of genetical genomic studies including eQTL detected in the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line samples derived from apparently healthy individuals of European and African ancestry. Considering the critical roles of epigenetic gene regulation, cytosine modification quantitative trait loci (mQTL) are expected to add a crucial layer of annotation to existing functional genomic information. Here, we describe the new features of the SCAN database that integrate comprehensive mQTL mapping results generated in the HapMap CEU (Caucasian residents from Utah, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) LCL samples and demonstrate the utility of the enhanced functional annotation system.Database URL:http://www.scandb.org/	2015-03-26	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361046400003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433157/SCAN-database-facilitating-integrative-analyses-of	10.1093/database/bav025	14685227,16255080,18439551,17289997,20369019,19933162,24015375,21839163,18313023,23792949,24943591,22955987,11125122,17571346,21118553,16632515,16236739,12163776,18828194,23047291,24568970,25087611,23715323,20216476	http://scandb.org/newinterface/index_v1.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=5&types=tttttttt	NULL	SCAN	http://scandb.org/newinterface/index_v1.html	database

Tudor,Karen E. Ross,Gang Li,K. Vijay-Shanker,Cathy H. Wu,Cecilia N. Arighi	NULL	Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification where a protein kinase adds a phosphate group to a protein, potentially regulating its function, localization and/or activity. Phosphorylation can affect protein–protein interactions (PPIs), abolishing interaction with previous binding partners or enabling new interactions. Extracting phosphorylation information coupled with PPI information from the scientific literature will facilitate the creation of phosphorylation interaction networks of kinases, substrates and interacting partners, toward knowledge discovery of functional outcomes of protein phosphorylation. Increasingly, PPI databases are interested in capturing the phosphorylation state of interacting partners. We have previously developed the eFIP (Extracting Functional Impact of Phosphorylation) text mining system, which identifies phosphorylated proteins and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. In this work, we present several enhancements for the eFIP system: (i) text mining for full-length articles from the PubMed Central open-access collection; (ii) the integration of the RLIMS-P 2.0 system for the extraction of phosphorylation events with kinase, substrate and site information; (iii) the extension of the PPI module with new trigger words/phrases describing interactions and (iv) the addition of the iSimp tool for sentence simplification to aid in the matching of syntactic patterns. We enhance the website functionality to: (i) support searches based on protein roles (kinases, substrates, interacting partners) or using keywords; (ii) link protein entities to their corresponding UniProt identifiers if mapped and (iii) support visual exploration of phosphorylation interaction networks using Cytoscape. The evaluation of eFIP on full-length articles achieved 92.4% precision, 76.5% recall and 83.7% F-measure on 100 article sections. To demonstrate eFIP for knowledge extraction and discovery, we constructed phosphorylation-dependent interaction networks involving 14‐3‐3 proteins identified from cancer-related versus diabetes-related articles. Comparison of the phosphorylation interaction network of kinases, phosphoproteins and interactants obtained from eFIP searches, along with enrichment analysis of the protein set, revealed several shared interactions, highlighting common pathways discussed in the context of both diseases.Database URL:http://proteininformationresource.org/efip	2015-03-31	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361047700001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433152/Construction-of-phosphorylation-interaction	10.1093/database/bav020	24270789,23221174,23327936,23132118,21576755,23517090,16046493,22759456,25448298,20671316,11791231,15231534,18237434,23974658,20550717,20183879,23323613,21149340,12471243,19131956,20920264,21945648,9278512,11751453,16532026,12042314,22899714,20138985,20141511,20843328,16288292,19208461,23944367,19915011,11583580,20574165,17369524,21157483	http://proteininformationresource.org/efip,http://proteininformationresource.org/efip,http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/rlimsp,http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/eFIPonline/Corpus.zip,http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/,http://www.r-project.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	eFIP	http://proteininformationresource.org/efip	NULL

However, no specific resource by integrating telomere interaction information data is currently available. To facilitate the understanding of the molecular interaction network by which telomeres are associated with biological process and diseases, we have developed TeloPIN (Telomeric Proteins Interaction Network) database (http://songyanglab.sysu.edu.cn/telopin/), a novel database that points to provide comprehensive information on protein–protein, protein–DNA and protein–RNA interaction of telomeres. TeloPIN database contains four types of interaction data, including (i) protein–protein interaction (PPI) data, (ii) telomeric proteins ChIP-seq data, (iii) telomere-associated proteins data and (iv) telomeric repeat-containing RNAs (TERRA)-interacting proteins data. By analyzing these four types of interaction data, we found that 358 and 199 proteins have more than one type of interaction information in human and mouse cells, respectively. We also developed table browser and TeloChIP genome browser to help researchers with better integrated visualization of interaction data from different studies.

Tandem duplicated genes related to certain functions will lead to the expansion of gene families and bring increase of gene dosage in the form of gene cluster arrays. Many tandem duplication events have been studied in plant genomes; yet, there is a surprising shortage of efforts to systematically present the integration of large amounts of information about publicly deposited tandem duplicated gene data across the plant kingdom. To address this shortcoming, we developed the first plant tandem duplicated genes database, PTGBase. It delivers the most comprehensive resource available to date, spanning 39 plant genomes, including model species and newly sequenced species alike. Across these genomes, 54 130 tandem duplicated gene clusters (129 652 genes) are presented in the database. Each tandem array, as well as its member genes, is characterized in complete detail. Tandem duplicated genes in PTGBase can be explored through browsing or searching by identifiers or keywords of functional annotation and sequence similarity. Users can download tandem duplicated gene arrays easily to any scale, up to the complete annotation data set for an entire plant genome. PTGBase will be updated regularly with newly sequenced plant species as they become available.Database URL:http://ocri-genomics.org/PTGBase/.	2015-03-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361046300002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433149/PTGBase-an-integrated-database-to-study-tandem	10.1093/database/bav017	12466850,11997344,15680516,22257007,20495794,17641193,16948529,15049302,23390519,24171911,24852848,24383931,10101175,7254315,15208399,17175529,18715958,23396833,11430355,16760422,11125125,15479712,17175540,17142241,11299044,9254694,11125061,24079801,22110026,12952885,16081474,15980438,10592175,11073452,12853957,21186351	http://ocri-genomics.org/PTGBase/,http://www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase,http://trbase.ex.ac.uk/,https://tandem.bu.edu/cgi-bin/trdb/trdb.exe,http://helios.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/TassDB/,http://vntr.csie.ntu.edu.tw/,http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr,http://ocri-genomics.org/PTGBase/,http://www.cpan.org/,http://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/,http://genome.jgi-psf.org/,http://www.blast2go.com/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttfff	NULL	PTGBase	http://ocri-genomics.org/PTGBase/	database

LMPID (Linear Motif mediated Protein Interaction Database) is a manually curated database which provides comprehensive experimentally validated information about the LMs mediating PPIs from all organisms on a single platform. About 2200 entries have been compiled by detailed manual curation of PubMed abstracts, of which about 1000 LM entries were being annotated for the first time, as compared with the Eukaryotic LM resource. The users can submit their query through a user-friendly search page and browse the data in the alphabetical order of the bait gene names and according to the domains interacting with the LM. LMPID is freely accessible athttp://bicresources.jcbose. ac.in/ssaha4/lmpidand contains 1750 unique LM instances found within 1181 baits interacting with 552 prey proteins. In summary, LMPID is an attempt to enrich the existing repertoire of resources available for studying the LMs implicated in PPIs and may help in understanding the patterns of LMs binding to a specific domain and develop prediction model to identify novel LMs specific to a domain and further able to predict inhibitors/modulators of PPI of interest.Database URL:http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/lmpid	2015-03-16	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav014%2f2433146%2fLMPID-A-manually-curated-database-of-linear-motifs	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433146/LMPID-A-manually-curated-database-of-linear-motifs	10.1093/database/bav014	17981571,16962311,18602004,20947012,25299147,22532795,22825353,24622521,24214962,22146221,12824383,15513994	http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/lmpid,http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/lmpid	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=ttttttff	NULL	LMPID	http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/lmpid	database

Sahoo,Raman Parkesh	NULL	We have developed EpiDBase (www.epidbase.org), an interactive database of small molecule ligands of epigenetic protein families by bringing together experimental, structural and chemoinformatic data in one place. Currently, EpiDBase encompasses 5784 unique ligands (11 422 entries) of various epigenetic markers such as writers, erasers and readers. The EpiDBase includes experimental IC50values, ligand molecular weight, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor count, XlogP, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings, InChIKey, two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures. A catalog of all epidbase ligands based on the molecular weight is also provided. A structure editor is provided for 3D visualization of ligands. EpiDBase is integrated with tools like text search, disease-specific search, advanced search, substructure, and similarity analysis. Advanced analysis can be performed using substructure and OpenBabel-based chemical similarity fingerprints. The EpiDBase is curated to identify unique molecular scaffolds. Initially, molecules were selected by removing peptides, macrocycles and other complex structures and then processed for conformational sampling by generating 3D conformers. Subsequent filtering through Zinc Is Not Commercial (ZINC: a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening) and Lilly MedChem regular rules retained many distinctive drug-like molecules. These molecules were then analyzed for physicochemical properties using OpenBabel descriptors and clustered using various methods such as hierarchical clustering, binning partition and multidimensional scaling. EpiDBase provides comprehensive resources for further design, development and refinement of small molecule modulators of epigenetic markers.Database URL:www.epidbase.org	2015-03-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361045400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433145/EpiDBase-a-manually-curated-database-for-small	10.1093/database/bav013	22498752,23211769,22894577,12724232,17675334,24900399,22722985,22534504,22965876,22718786,21075792,23193265,22761927,24470572,21948594,15667143,23061697,24163098,17985865,21982300,18328109,21636592,21576229,23343401,12612645,10680113,20158188,9611787	http://www.epidbase.org,http://www.epidbase.org,http://d3js.org/,http://www.vlifesciences.com,http://openbabel.org/,http://www.jmol.org/,http://www.chemaxon.com,http://www.rdkit.org/,http://chemmine.ucr.edu/,http://www.epidbase.org,http://openbabel.org,http://www.ggasoftware.com/opensource/indigo/chemdiff,http://www.epidbase.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=tttttttt	NULL	EpiDBase	http://www.epidbase.org	database

The structures and functions of most ncRNAs are however still unknown. Most of the available RNA structural databases rely heavily on known 3D structures, and contextually correlate base pairing geometry with actual 3D RNA structures. None of the databases provide any direct information about stabilization energies. However, the intrinsic interaction energies of constituent base pairs can provide significant insights into their roles in the overall dynamics of RNA motifs and structures. Quantum mechanical (QM) computations provide the only approach toward their accurate quantification and characterization. ‘RNA Base Pair Count, Geometry and Stability’ (http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST) brings together information, extracted from literature data, regarding occurrence frequency, experimental and quantum chemically optimized geometries, and computed interaction energies, for non-canonical base pairs observed in a non-redundant dataset of functional RNA structures. The database is designed to enable the QM community, on the one hand, to identify appropriate biologically relevant model systems and also enable the biology community to easily sift through diverse computational results to gain theoretical insights which could promote hypothesis driven biological research.Database URL:http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST	2015-03-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361045300003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433143/RNABP-COGEST-a-resource-for-investigating	10.1093/database/bav011	6562377,10535731,11014183,17571346,18820678,23034808,19137333,19625387,23891726,12860120,16852393,16853403,19152254,16838999,20163171,19528080,21254753,25070186,11345429,12177293,18700982,17921499,23970545,11752346,17947325,22127861,24220091,11752347,18845572,17694311,21515634,17914224,18399704,26609626,20354152,22066539,22529851,16928138,11601858,17124630,21999672,24144333,20945881,22953716,24502340,24990628,9079386,16853964	http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST,http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST,http://www.saha.ac.in/biop/www/HD-RNAS.html,http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST,http://www.saha.ac.in/biop/www/db/local/BP/rnabasepair.html,http://www.bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST/home_browse.html,http://wwwbioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST/home_search.html,http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST/help.html,http://www.begdb.com	NULL	NULL	COGEST	http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/RNABPCOGEST	NULL

Hong	NULL	The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) project is an ongoing collaborative effort to create a catalog of genomic annotations. To date, the project has generated over 4000 experiments across more than 350 cell lines and tissues using a wide array of experimental techniques to study the chromatin structure, regulatory network and transcriptional landscape of theHomo sapiensandMus musculusgenomes. All ENCODE experimental data, metadata and associated computational analyses are submitted to the ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) for validation, tracking, storage and distribution to community resources and the scientific community. As the volume of data increases, the organization of experimental details becomes increasingly complicated and demands careful curation to identify related experiments. Here, we describe the ENCODE DCC’s use of ontologies to standardize experimental metadata. We discuss how ontologies, when used to annotate metadata, provide improved searching capabilities and facilitate the ability to find connections within a set of experiments. Additionally, we provide examples of how ontologies are used to annotate ENCODE metadata and how the annotations can be identified via ontology-driven searches at the ENCODE portal. As genomic datasets grow larger and more interconnected, standardization of metadata becomes increasingly vital to allow for exploration and comparison of data between different scientific projects.Database URL:https://www.encodeproject.org/	2015-03-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361045300002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433142/Ontology-application-and-use-at-the-ENCODE-DCC	10.1093/database/bav010	22955616,23193274,22889292,25164756,25164757,25164755,22075998,21856757,10802651,22293552,16381917,18629098,15693950,20200009,23180789,20626927,15892872,21672956,20460452,22646023,22102568,20935045,23479348,24595056,22096232,22139929,24413672	https://www.encodeproject.org/,https://www.encodeproject.org/,https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/encoded/tree/master/src/encoded/schemas,http://uberon.org,http://cellontology.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi,http://obi-ontology.org,http://www.sequenceontology.org,http://protege.stanford.edu/,http://bioportal.bioontology.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/,http://ols.wordvis.com/,https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues,http://sourceforge.net/p/obo/cell-ontology-cl-requests/,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/panda/jira/browse/FGPTO-730?jql=project%20%3D%20FGPTO,http://sourceforge.net/p/obi/obi-terms/,https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started#search,https://www.encodeproject.org/,https://www.encodeproject.org/,https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=experiment,https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=experiment,http://geneontology.org/page/go-slim-and-subset-guide,http://amigo1.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/slimmer,https://code.google.com/p/owltools/,https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started#browse,http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/pro.shtml,http://edamontology.org,https://github.com/tucotuco/bco,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/services/biosamples/,https://www.encodeproject.org/help/rest-api	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=28&types=btttttwg	NULL	ENCODE	https://www.encodeproject.org/	app

It contains 845–1325 predicted motifs in each sample, which result in a total of 2684 non-redundant motifs. In comparison with seven large collections of known motifs, more than 84% of the 2684 predicted motifs are similar to the known motifs, and 54–76% of the known motifs are similar to the predicted motifs. PreDREM also stores 43 663–20 13 288 motif modules in each sample, which provide the cofactor motifs of each predicted motif. Compared with motifs of known interacting transcription factor (TF) pairs in eight resources, on average, 84% of motif pairs corresponding to known interacting TF pairs are included in the predicted motif modules. Through its web interface, PreDREM allows users to browse motif information by tissues, datasets, individual non-redundant motifs, etc. Users can also search motifs, motif modules, instances of motifs and motif modules in given genomic regions, tissue or cell types a motif occurs, etc. PreDREM thus provides a useful resource for the understanding of cell- and tissue-specific gene regulation in the human genome.Database URL:http://server.cs.ucf.edu/predrem/.	2015-02-27	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav007%2f2433139%2fPreDREM-a-database-of-predicted-DNA-regulatory	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433139/PreDREM-a-database-of-predicted-DNA-regulatory	10.1093/database/bav007	2667136,10812473,9169833,16606704,20946653,22058225,22915576,22955619,24322294,8594589,22955990,21037262,22955618,23175603,24335146,23332764,18006570,14681366,22955616,19274049,18243105,22955828,22955617,25505144,21543442,24194598,23180794,24214955	http://server.cs.ucf.edu/predrem/,http://server.cs.ucf.edu/predrem/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	PreDREM	http://server.cs.ucf.edu/predrem/	database

However, many relevant tools consider a limited number of pathway sources, missing out on many genes and gene-to-gene connections. Simply pooling several pathways sources would result in redundancy and the lack of systematic pathway interrelations. To address this, we exercised a combination of hierarchical clustering and nearest neighbor graph representation, with judiciously selected cutoff values, thereby consolidating 3215 human pathways from 12 sources into a set of 1073 SuperPaths. Our unification algorithm finds a balance between reducing redundancy and optimizing the level of pathway-related informativeness for individual genes. We show a substantial enhancement of the SuperPaths’ capacity to infer gene-to-gene relationships when compared with individual pathway sources, separately or taken together. Further, we demonstrate that the chosen 12 sources entail nearly exhaustive gene coverage. The computed SuperPaths are presented in a new online database, PathCards, showing each SuperPath, its constituent network of pathways, and its contained genes. This provides researchers with a rich, searchable systems analysis resource.Database URL:http://pathcards.genecards.org/	2015-02-27	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbav006%2f2433138%2fPathCards-multi-source-consolidation-of-human	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433138/PathCards-multi-source-consolidation-of-human	10.1093/database/bav006	16381921,18652912,21999653,19854944,21071392,19811689,18940869,22123737,23134636,21067998,19880382,23824865,22096230,24225315,18832364,19948758,11590099,20067622,17882155,23331499,15985496,11674852,23874394,18925949,18940858,22238607,23666626,22962466,19033363,23192548,21576238,20001862,15855896,23172862,22155609	http://pathcards.genecards.org/,http://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/,http://lsresearch.thomsonreuters.com/maps/,http://www.rndsystems.com/Pathways.aspx,http://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science/cst-pathways/science-pathways,http://www.tocris.com/signallingPathways.php,http://www.sinobiological.com/,http://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/,http://lsresearch.thomsonreuters.com/maps/,http://www.rndsystems.com/Pathways.aspx,http://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science/cst-pathways/science-pathways,http://www.tocris.com/signallingPathways.php,http://www.sinobiological.com/,http://www.genecards.org/,http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/,http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/,http://pathcards.genecards.org/,http://varelect.genecards.org/,http://geneanalytics.genecards.org/,http://pathcards.genecards.org/	NULL	NULL	PathCards	http://pathcards.genecards.org/	NULL

To better understand the roles of TEs in structural, functional and evolutionary dynamics of the mulberry genome, a specific, comprehensive and user-friendly web-based database, MnTEdb, was constructed. It was built based on a detailed and accurate identification of all TEs in mulberry. A total of 5925 TEs belonging to 13 superfamilies and 1062 families were deposited in this database. MnTEdb enables users to search, browse and download the mulberry TE sequences. Meanwhile, data mining tools, including BLAST, GetORF, HMMER, Sequence Extractor and JBrowse were also integrated into MnTEdb.

Proteins must be localized at their appropriate subcellular compartment to perform their desired function. Mislocalization of proteins to unintended locations is a causative factor for many human diseases; therefore, collection of known sorting signals will help support many important areas of biomedical research. By performing an extensive literature study, we compiled a collection of 533 experimentally determined localization signals, along with the proteins that harbor such signals. Each signal in the LocSigDB is annotated with its localization, source, PubMed references and is linked to the proteins in UniProt database along with the organism information that contain the same amino acid pattern as the given signal. From LocSigDB webserver, users can download the whole database or browse/search for data using an intuitive query interface.

The molecular mechanisms of many fundamental cellular processes have been discovered through research on this bacterium. Although much basic research now focuses on more complex model organisms,E. colistill remains important in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Despite its long history as a subject of molecular investigation, more than one-third of theE. coligenome has no pathway annotation supported by either experimental evidence or manual curation. Recently, a network-assisted genetics approach to the efficient identification of novel gene functions has increased in popularity. To accelerate the speed of pathway annotation for the remaining uncharacterized part of theE. coligenome, we have constructed a database of cofunctional gene network with near-complete genome coverage of the organism, dubbed EcoliNet. We find that EcoliNet is highly predictive for diverse bacterial phenotypes, including antibiotic response, indicating that it will be useful in prioritizing novel candidate genes for a wide spectrum of bacterial phenotypes. We have implemented a web server where biologists can easily run network algorithms over EcoliNet to predict novel genes involved in a pathway or novel functions for a gene. All integrated cofunctional associations can be downloaded, enabling orthology-based reconstruction of gene networks for other bacterial species as well.Database URL:http://www.inetbio.org/ecolinet	2015-02-02	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000348650200001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2433133/EcoliNet-a-database-of-cofunctional-gene-network	10.1093/database/bav001	23161678,23358379,23143106,17912365,24225315,15567862,23193258,22096229,24165882,10958638,11230160,15128449,9787636,12923548,24194096,22121220,14681454,22096227,23203989,15690043,16606699,19402753,24561554,21185072,23203871,20656902,23685435,24013487	http://www.inetbio.org/ecolinet,http://www.inetbio.org/ecolinet,http://www.inetbio.org/ecolinet/downloadnetwork.php	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	EcoliNet	http://www.inetbio.org/ecolinet	database

ProtoBug platform presents the relatedness of complete proteomes from 17 insects as well as a proteome of the crustacean,Daphnia pulex. The represented proteomes from insects include louse, bee, beetle, ants, flies and mosquitoes. Based on an unsupervised clustering method, protein sequences were clustered into a hierarchical tree, called ProtoBug. ProtoBug covers about 300 000 sequences that are partitioned to families. At the default setting, all sequences are partitioned to ∼20 000 families (excluding singletons). From the species perspective, each of the 18 analysed proteomes is composed of 5000–8000 families. In the regime of the advanced operational mode, the ProtoBug provides rich navigation capabilities for touring the hierarchy of the families at any selected resolution. A proteome viewer shows the composition of sequences from any of the 18 analysed proteomes. Using functional annotation from an expert system (Pfam) we assigned domains, families and repeats by 4400 keywords that cover 73% of the sequences. A strict inference protocol is applied for expanding the functional knowledge. Consequently, secured annotations were associated with 81% of the proteins, and with 70% of the families (≥10 proteins each). ProtoBug is a database and webtool with rich visualization and navigation tools. The properties of each family in relation to other families in the ProtoBug tree, and in view of the taxonomy composition are reported.

Numerous efforts especially large-scale phosphoproteome profiling studies have been contributed to dissect the phosphorylation signaling in various plants, while a large number of phosphorylation events were identified. To provide an integrated data resource for further investigations, here we present a comprehensive database of dbPPT (database of Phosphorylation site in PlanTs, athttp://dbppt.biocuckoo.org), which contains experimentally identified phosphorylation sites in proteins from plants. The phosphorylation sites in dbPPT were manually curated from the literatures, whereas datasets in other public databases were also integrated. In total, there were 82 175 phosphorylation sites in 31 012 proteins from 20 plant organisms in dbPPT, presenting a larger quantity of phosphorylation sites and a higher coverage of plant species in comparison with other databases. The proportions of residue types including serine, threonine and tyrosine were 77.99, 17.81 and 4.20%, respectively. All the phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites in the database were critically annotated. Since the phosphorylation signaling in plants attracted great attention recently, such a comprehensive resource of plant protein phosphorylation can be useful for the research community.Database URL:http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org	2014-12-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000346858000002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635578/dbPPT-a-comprehensive-database-of-protein	10.1093/database/bau121	15950870,19269802,11749373,8347989,17212583,8721752,22784827,22783265,17765599,15095459,16991200,18463617,19212952,19178300,21764629,23572148,24043427,23660473,22135298,21062810,23193290,24705204,11125063,23172287,24243849,22701463,24253303,24316576,24259429,19162527,23609542,16273072,12631575,23111157,9452427,23751130,24214991,23172288,24214993	http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org,http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org,http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org/download.php,http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org/getTable.php?seqID=accession	NULL	NULL	dbPPT	http://dbppt.biocuckoo.org	database

The potential biological information stored in essential oil composition data can provide an insight into the silent language of plants, and the roles of these chemical emissions in defense, communication and pollinator attraction. In order to decipher volatile profile patterns from a global perspective, we have developed the ESSential OIL DataBase (EssOilDB), a continually updated, freely available electronic database designed to provide knowledge resource for plant essential oils, that enables one to address a multitude of queries on volatile profiles of native, invasive, normal or stressed plants, across taxonomic clades, geographical locations and several other biotic and abiotic influences. To our knowledge, EssOilDB is the only database in the public domain providing an opportunity for context based scientific research on volatile patterns in plants. EssOilDB presently contains 123 041 essential oil records spanning a century of published reports on volatile profiles, with data from 92 plant taxonomic families, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. We hope that this huge repository of VOCs will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. We also illustrate the use of this database in terpene biology and show how EssOilDB can be used to complement data from computational genomics to gain insights into the diversity and variability of terpenoids in the plant kingdom. EssOilDB would serve as a valuable information resource, for students and researchers in plant biology, in the design and discovery of new odor profiles, as well as for entrepreneurs—the potential for generating consumer specific scents being one of the most attractive and interesting topics in the cosmetic industry.Database URL:http://nipgr.res.in/Essoildb/	2014-12-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000346858000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635577/EssOilDB-a-database-of-essential-oils-reflecting	10.1093/database/bau120	19377454,18534640,10517823,11251117,16469918,21114471,12175534,9824849,12727504,12803571,12720373,12802721,17199238,20840911,22951395,23081927,22102013,21480513,22039990,18249199,19575586,23451776	http://nipgr.res.in/Essoildb/,http://www.issg.org/database/welcome/,http://plants.usda.gov/java/noxiousDriver,http://www.invasive.org/,http://huilesutiles.eu/docs/niaouli.pdf,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,http://www.aromaweb.com/essentialoils/,http://www.cropwatch.org/,http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/,http://www.aromaweb.com/,http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/,http://www.cropwatch.org/,http://essentialoils.org/eoudb/,http://www.quintessential.uk.com/index.php,http://www.labaroma.com,http://www.leffingwell.com/baciseso.htm	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	EssOilDB	http://nipgr.res.in/Essoildb/	database

Pieper	NULL	Understanding prokaryotic transformation of recalcitrant pollutants and thein-situmetabolic nets require the integration of massive amounts of biological data. Decades of biochemical studies together with novel next-generation sequencing data have exponentially increased information on aerobic aromatic degradation pathways. However, the majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of key catabolic protein families and of proteins of documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given protein family of AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization of individual protein superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses the deficiencies of homology-based protein function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways. We pursue in future the expansion of AromaDeg to other enzyme families involved in aromatic degradation and its regular update.Database URL:http://aromadeg.siona.helmholtz-hzi.de	2014-12-01	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000345898300001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635556/AromaDeg-a-novel-database-for-phylogenomics-of	10.1093/database/bau118	18043662,10851146,16712999,14550940,11395407,10467151,10704478,18769432,20860734,20011109,12519970,16381924,2327971,9226262,15608267,24101916,19405962,20435670,18986994,14734307,2439888,9521918,12805538,12596227,11139625,12093901,12028595,12520012,15117755,24270786,19920124,23197659,7704279,8626733,8830689,8335622,10542173,10387005,22515215,16030014,11729263,15262932,10448110,9244273,2261999,9169437,15262943,12620844,16930152,1622263,16348159,9525941,2231712,23329690,21546353,3447015,10224014,21369832,8433381,19854763,20472542,14756875,16672497,22832345	http://aromadeg.siona.helmholtz-hzi.de,http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/,http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,http://aromadeg.siona.helmholtz-hzi.de,http://aromadeg.siona.helmholtz-hzi.de	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttf	NULL	AromaDeg	http://aromadeg.siona.helmholtz-hzi.de	database

The availability of tools has enabled genome-wide scans for disease susceptibility loci associated with infectious diseases. Till now, information on human genetic variations and their associated genes that modulate TB susceptibility have not been systematically compiled. In this work, we have created a resource: HGV&TB, which hosts genetic variations reported to be associated with TB susceptibility in humans. It currently houses information on 307 variations in 98 genes. In total, 101 of these variations are exonic, whereas 78 fall in intronic regions. We also analysed the pathogenicity of the genetic variations, their phenotypic consequences and ethnic origin. Using various computational analyses, 30 variations of the 101 exonic variations were predicted to be pathogenic. The resource is freely available athttp://genome.igib.res.in/hgvtb/index.html.

In an attempt to properly manage and retrieve chloroplastic SSRs, we designed ChloroSSRdb which is a relational database developed using SQL server 2008 and accessed through ASP.NET. It provides information of all the three types (perfect, imperfect and compound) of SSRs. At present, ChloroSSRdb contains 124 430 mined SSRs, with majority lying in non-coding region. Out of these, PCR primers were designed for 118 249 SSRs. Tetranucleotide repeats (47 079) were found to be the most frequent repeat type, whereas hexanucleotide repeats (6414) being the least abundant. Additionally, in each species statistical analyses were performed to calculate relative frequency, correlation coefficient and chi-square statistics of perfect and imperfect SSRs. In accordance with the growing interest in SSR studies, ChloroSSRdb will prove to be a useful resource in developing genetic markers, phylogenetic analysis, genetic mapping, etc. Moreover, it will serve as a ready reference for mined SSRs in available chloroplast genomes of green plants.Database URL:www.compubio.in/chlorossrdb/	2014-11-06	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000344944800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635401/ChloroSSRdb-a-repository-of-perfect-and-imperfect	10.1093/database/bau107	23447524,21424877,15012188,7888752,8587102,6247908,21129182,16567018,18287206,12519959,16737546,17623061,23284085,17379689,22730293	http://www.compubio.in/chlorossrdb/,http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/download/misa.pl,http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	ChloroSSRdb	http://www.compubio.in/chlorossrdb/	repository

However, annotation pipelines often do not consider small reading frames likely to be expressed. BactPepDB, available online athttp://bactpepdb.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr, is a database that aims at providing an exhaustive re-annotation of all complete prokaryotic genomes—chromosomal and plasmid DNA—available in RefSeq for coding sequences ranging between 10 and 80 amino acids. The identified peptides are classified as (i) previously identified in RefSeq, (ii) entity-overlapping (intragenic) or intergenic, and (iii) potential pseudogenes—intergenic sequences corresponding to a portion of a previously annotated larger gene. Additional information is related to homologs within order, predicted signal sequence, transmembrane segments, disulfide bonds, secondary structure, and the existence of a related 3D structure in the Protein Databank. As a result, BactPepDB provides insights about candidate peptides, and provides information about their conservation, together with some of their expected biological/structural features. The BactPepDB interface allows to search for candidate peptides in the database, or to search for peptides similar to a query, according to the multiple properties predicted or related to genomic localization.Database URL:http://www.yeastgenome.org/	2014-11-05	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000344944600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635377/BactPepDB-a-database-of-predicted-peptides-from-a	10.1093/database/bau106	19879957,19929848,16505481,22622039,15166257,22424670,17160061,21504831,20177945,23588666,16472251,19447041,9154108,19072229,19025129,10701998,17975071,20230630,17130148,14672834,17341497,18957441,17941971,20462861,19923233,22110032,22325123,21071416,23180797,16221310,22467909,14658787,17913739,17678535,16381860,19880386,20159464,11884641,2231712,19346311,16138101,17551524,16159757,15701695,10493868,15147844,10592235,16320312,11152613,21959131,23056189,20122190,21988835,15173120,23097430,23806640,9572965,14973042,9461412,8357242,24163254	http://bactpepdb.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr,http://www.yeastgenome.org/,http://bactpepdb.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr	NULL	NULL	BactPepDB	http://bactpepdb.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr	database

Molina-Vila,Cristina Marino-Buslje	NULL	Somatic mutations in protein kinases (PKs) are frequent driver events in many human tumors, while germ-line mutations are associated with hereditary diseases. Here we present Kin-driver, the first database that compiles driver mutations in PKs with experimental evidence demonstrating their functional role. Kin-driver is a manual expert-curated database that pays special attention to activating mutations (AMs) and can serve as a validation set to develop new generation tools focused on the prediction of gain-of-function driver mutations. It also offers an easy and intuitive environment to facilitate the visualization and analysis of mutations in PKs. Because all mutations are mapped onto a multiple sequence alignment, analogue positions between kinases can be identified and tentative new mutations can be proposed for studying by transferring annotation. Finally, our database can also be of use to clinical and translational laboratories, helping them to identify uncommon AMs that can correlate with response to new antitumor drugs. The website was developed using PHP and JavaScript, which are supported by all major browsers; the database was built using MySQL server.

Hence, miRNAs play a key role in host–virus interactions and pathogenesis of viral diseases. Lately, miRNAs have also shown potential as important targets for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Although several miRNA and their target repositories are available for human and other organisms in literature, but a dedicated resource on viral miRNAs and their targets are lacking. Therefore, we have developed a comprehensive viral miRNA resource harboring information of 9133 entries in three subdatabases. This includes 1308 experimentally validated miRNA sequences with their isomiRs encoded by 44 viruses in viral miRNA ‘VIRmiRNA’ and 7283 of their target genes in ‘VIRmiRtar’. Additionally, there is information of 542 antiviral miRNAs encoded by the host against 24 viruses in antiviral miRNA ‘AVIRmir’. The web interface was developed using Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) software bundle. User-friendly browse, search, advanced search and useful analysis tools are also provided on the web interface. VIRmiRNA is the first specialized resource of experimentally proven virus-encoded miRNAs and their associated targets.

Bajic	NULL	Microorganisms are known to counteract salt stress through salt influx or by the accumulation of osmoprotectants (also called compatible solutes). Understanding the pathways that synthesize and/or breakdown these osmoprotectants is of interest to studies of crops halotolerance and to biotechnology applications that use microbes as cell factories for production of biomass or commercial chemicals. To facilitate the exploration of osmoprotectants, we have developed the first online resource, ‘Dragon Explorer of Osmoprotection associated Pathways’ (DEOP) that gathers and presents curated information about osmoprotectants, complemented by information about reactions and pathways that use or affect them. A combined total of 141 compounds were confirmed osmoprotectants, which were matched to 1883 reactions and 834 pathways. DEOP can also be used to map genes or microbial genomes to potential osmoprotection-associated pathways, and thus link genes and genomes to other associated osmoprotection information. Moreover, DEOP provides a text-mining utility to search deeper into the scientific literature for supporting evidence or for new associations of osmoprotectants to pathways, reactions, enzymes, genes or organisms. Two case studies are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of DEOP.

The system stores SNP and indel calls in a local database, designed to handle very large datasets, to allow for rapid analysis using simple commands in R. Functional annotations are included in the system, making it suitable for direct identification of disease-causing mutations in human exome- (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) projects. The system has a built-in filtering function implemented to simultaneously take into account variant calls from all individual samples. This enables advanced comparative analysis of variant distribution between groups of samples, including detection of candidate causative mutations within family structures and genome-wide association by sequencing. In most cases, these analyses are executed within just a matter of seconds, even when there are several hundreds of samples and millions of variants in the database.

Charles	NULL	MetaProx is the database of metagenomic proximons: a searchable repository of proximon objects conceived with two specific goals. The first objective is to accelerate research involving metagenomic functional interactions by providing a database of metagenomic operon candidates. Proximons represent a special subset of directons (series of contiguous co-directional genes) where each member gene is in close proximity to its neighbours with respect to intergenic distance. As a result, proximons represent significant operon candidates where some subset of proximons is the set of true metagenomic operons. Proximons are well suited for the inference of metagenomic functional networks because predicted functional linkages do not rely on homology-dependent information that is frequently unavailable in metagenomic scenarios. The second objective is to explore representations for semistructured biological data that can offer an alternative to the traditional relational database approach.

Given the importance of this vegetable to humans, research and breeding communities on carrot should obtain useful genomic and transcriptomic information. The first whole-genome sequences of ‘DC-27’ carrot werede novoassembled and analyzed. Transcriptomic sequences of 14 carrot genotypes were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and mapped to the whole-genome sequence before assembly. Based on these data sets, the first Web-based genomic and transcriptomic database forD. carota(CarrotDB) was developed (database homepage:http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/car rotdb). CarrotDB offers the tools of Genome Map and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. Using these tools, users can search certain target genes and simple sequence repeats along with designed primers of ‘DC-27’. Assembled transcriptomic sequences along with fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs sequenced information (FPKM) information of 14 carrot genotypes are also provided. Users can downloadde novoassembled whole-genome sequences, putative gene sequences and putative protein sequences of ‘DC-27’. Users can also download transcriptome sequence assemblies of 14 carrot genotypes along with their FPKM information. A total of 2826 transcription factor (TF) genes classified into 57 families were identified in the entire genome sequences. These TF genes were embedded in CarrotDB as an interface. The ‘GERMPLASM’ part of CarrotDB also offers taproot photos of 45 carrot genotypes and a table containing accession numbers, names, countries of origin and colors of cortex, phloem and xylem parts of taproots corresponding to each carrot genotype. CarrotDB will be continuously updated with new information.Database URL:http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb/	2014-09-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000342752500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635221/CarrotDB-a-genomic-and-transcriptomic-database-for	10.1093/database/bau096	21810238,14587087,22548759,20019144,15215400,10802651,12969510,16081474,21806822,22312429,19289445,22388286,20003500,18516045,21381748,12368253,18440982,24432327	http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb,http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb/,http://faostat3.fao.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/,http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb,http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html,http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Minimus2,http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/	NULL	NULL	CarrotDB	http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb	database

However, extracting biological insights from whole-cell models requires running and analyzing large numbers of simulations. We developed WholeCellSimDB, a database for organizing whole-cell simulations. WholeCellSimDB was designed to enable researchers to search simulation metadata to identify simulations for further analysis, and quickly slice and aggregate simulation results data. In addition, WholeCellSimDB enables users to share simulations with the broader research community. The database uses a hybrid relational/hierarchical data format architecture to efficiently store and retrieve both simulation setup metadata and results data. WholeCellSimDB provides a graphical Web-based interface to search, browse, plot and export simulations; a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web service to retrieve data for Web-based visualizations; a command-line interface to deposit simulations; and a Python API to retrieve data for advanced analysis. Overall, we believe WholeCellSimDB will help researchers use whole-cell models to advance basic biological science and bioengineering.Database URL:http://www.wholecellsimdb.orgSource code repository URL:http://github.com/CovertLab/WholeCellSimDB	2014-09-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000342752100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2635208/WholeCellSimDB-a-hybrid-relational-HDF-database	10.1093/database/bau095	22817898,24185838,875032,23193287,23193258,24214961,24259429,24253303,20426874,19850718,23175606,23715986,18658182,21169341,12520051,20399180,21070939,21943917,21552546,22172142,23964998,21516115,21704062,16263707,15129285,18621757	http://www.wholecellsimdb.org,http://github.com/CovertLab/WholeCellSimDB,http://httpd.apache.org,http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi,http://www.djangoproject.com,http://www.mysql.com,http://www.h5py.org,http://haystacksearch.org,http://xapian.org,http://www.google.com/cse,http://jquery.com,http://www.jqwidgets.com,http://mbraak.github.io/jqTree,http://www.flotcharts.org,http://github.com/CovertLab/WholeCellSimDB,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org/help,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org,http://www.wholecellsimdb.org/help,http://simtk.org/home/wholecell	NULL	NULL	WholeCellSimDB	http://www.wholecellsimdb.org	database

It is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, and is thus often considered as one of the bottlenecks in literature curation. There is a growing need for semiautomated or fully automated GO curation techniques that will help database curators to rapidly and accurately identify gene function information in full-length articles. Despite multiple attempts in the past, few studies have proven to be useful with regard to assisting real-world GO curation. The shortage of sentence-level training data and opportunities for interaction between text-mining developers and GO curators has limited the advances in algorithm development and corresponding use in practical circumstances. To this end, we organized a text-mining challenge task for literature-based GO annotation in BioCreative IV. More specifically, we developed two subtasks: (i) to automatically locate text passages that contain GO-relevant information (a text retrieval task) and (ii) to automatically identify relevant GO terms for the genes in a given article (a concept-recognition task). With the support from five MODs, we provided teams with >4000 unique text passages that served as the basis for each GO annotation in our task data. Such evidence text information has long been recognized as critical for text-mining algorithm development but was never made available because of the high cost of curation. In total, seven teams participated in the challenge task. From the team results, we conclude that the state of the art in automatically mining GO terms from literature has improved over the past decade while much progress is still needed for computer-assisted GO curation. Future work should focus on addressing remaining technical challenges for improved performance of automatic GO concept recognition and incorporating practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world GO annotation.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/track-4-GO/.	2014-08-25	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000341308000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634979/Overview-of-the-gene-ontology-task-at-BioCreative	10.1093/database/bau086	19921742,17634621,23161678,23703206,21998156,22127867,23725347,21094696,19622167,15960828,15960829,18834495,22151901,23613707,16722582,21613640,19166973,20382265,16875881,16287934,24013487,20152934,10802651,20472411,20876938	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/track-4-GO/,http://flybase.org/,http://www.maizegdb.org/,http://rgd.mcw.edu/,http://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://www.wormbase.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/track-4-GO/	NULL

Reyes,Mira Anne C. dela Rosa,Shabbir Syed-Abdul,Richard Tzong-Han Tsai,Wen-Lian Hsu	NULL	Biomarkers are biomolecules in the human body that can indicate disease states and abnormal biological processes. Biomarkers are often used during clinical trials to identify patients with cancers. Although biomedical research related to biomarkers has increased over the years and substantial effort has been expended to obtain results in these studies, the specific results obtained often contain ambiguities, and the results might contradict each other. Therefore, the information gathered from these studies must be appropriately integrated and organized to facilitate experimentation on biomarkers. In this study, we used liver cancer as the target and developed a text-mining–based curation system named LiverCancerMarkerRIF, which allows users to retrieve biomarker-related narrations and curators to curate supporting evidence on liver cancer biomarkers directly while browsing PubMed. In contrast to most of the other curation tools that require curators to navigate away from PubMed and accommodate distinct user interfaces or Web sites to complete the curation process, our system provides a user-friendly method for accessing text-mining–aided information and a concise interface to assist curators while they remain at the PubMed Web site. Biomedical text-mining techniques are applied to automatically recognize biomedical concepts such as genes, microRNA, diseases and investigative technologies, which can be used to evaluate the potential of a certain gene as a biomarker.

Specifically, neural development is also of great clinical relevance because several human neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism disorders or drug addiction and also brain malformations are thought to have neurodevelopmental origins, i.e. pathogenesis initiates during childhood and adolescence. Impacts during early neurodevelopment might also predispose to late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. The neural tube develops from its precursor tissue, the neural plate, in a patterning process that is determined by compartmentalization into morphogenetic units, the action of local signaling centers and a well-defined and locally restricted expression of genes and their interactions. While public databases provide gene expression data with spatio-temporal resolution, they usually neglect the genetic interactions that govern neural development. Here, we introduce Mouse IDGenes, a reference database for genetic interactions in the developing mouse brain. The database is highly curated and offers detailed information about gene expressions and the genetic interactions at the developing mid-/hindbrain boundary. To showcase the predictive power of interaction data, we infer new Wnt/β-catenin target genes by machine learning and validate one of them experimentally. The database is updated regularly. Moreover, it can easily be extended by the research community. Mouse IDGenes will contribute as an important resource to the research on mouse brain development, not exclusively by offering data retrieval, but also by allowing data input.Database URL:http://mouseidgenes.helmholtz-muenchen.de.	2014-08-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000340628900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634922/Mouse-IDGenes-a-reference-database-for-genetic	10.1093/database/bau083	15322917,11253000,23308148,22792203,19793884,17166916,23307071,23390117,19933510,23518331,24388609,21062809,17151600,14681479,16381949,20684787,10910359,17170765,16362910,19348642,23203871,22121220,23203989,19936059,23799959,23871546,19876817,11262869,12671645,9651497,23972281,16825303,22682243,19736321,17627138,19951692,18820178,1534034,8848044,10495268,10201372,15592430,17090534,23041116,19736322,19122665,14716020,14522868,9056772,23444360,11326276,12052822,8906497,15860560,8532532,17494773,21559189,21092110,11900978,10824856,12130776,18093317,24194598	http://mouseidgenes.helmholtz-muenchen.de,http://mouseidgenes.helmholtz-muenchen.de,http://www.informatics.jax.org,http://www.postgresql.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=13&types=bttttttt	NULL	IDGenes	http://mouseidgenes.helmholtz-muenchen.de	database

Given its importance, it has been the subject of active research as well as the focus of curation in several biological databases. We have developedRule-basedLiteratureMiningSystem for proteinPhosphorylation (RLIMS-P), an online text-mining tool to help curators identify biomedical research articles relevant to protein phosphorylation. The tool presents information on protein kinases, substrates and phosphorylation sites automatically extracted from the biomedical literature. The utility of the RLIMS-P Web site has been evaluated by curators from Phospho.ELM, PhosphoGRID/BioGrid and Protein Ontology as part of the BioCreative IV user interactive task (IAT). The system achieved F-scores of 0.76, 0.88 and 0.92 for the extraction of kinase, substrate and phosphorylation sites, respectively, and a precision of 0.88 in the retrieval of relevant phosphorylation literature. The system also received highly favorable feedback from the curators in a user survey. Based on the curators’ suggestions, the Web site has been enhanced to improve its usability. In the RLIMS-P Web site, phosphorylation information can be retrieved by PubMed IDs or keywords, with an option for selecting targeted species. The result page displays a sortable table with phosphorylation information. The text evidence page displays the abstract with color-coded entity mentions and includes links to UniProtKB entries via normalization, i.e. the linking of entity mentions to database identifiers, facilitated by the GenNorm tool and by the links to the bibliography in UniProt. Log in and editing capabilities are offered to any user interested in contributing to the validation of RLIMS-P results. Retrieved phosphorylation information can also be downloaded in CSV format and the text evidence in the BioC format. RLIMS-P is freely available.Database URL:http://www.proteininformationresource.org/rlimsp/	2014-08-13	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000340179700001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634885/RLIMS-P-an-online-text-mining-tool-for-literature	10.1093/database/bau081	19299117,22471710,21062810,22135298,24270789,24253303,15814565,15961474,23637705,15556482,12520019,16377174	http://www.proteininformationresource.org/rlimsp/,http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/rlimsp/files/RLIMSP_guidelines.pdf,http://proteininformationresource.org/iPTMnet	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	RLIMS-P	http://www.proteininformationresource.org/rlimsp/	NULL

As a result of progressive insights into the miRNome and its complexity, miRBase underwent addition and deletion of miRNA records, changes in annotated miRNA sequences and adoption of more complex naming schemes over time. Unfortunately, miRBase does not allow straightforward assessment of these ongoing miRNA annotation changes, which has resulted in substantial ambiguity regarding miRNA identity and sequence in public literature, in target prediction databases and in content on various commercially available analytical platforms. As a result, correct interpretation, comparison and integration of miRNA study results are compromised, which we demonstrate here by assessing the impact of ignoring sequence annotation changes. To address this problem, we developed miRBase Tracker (www.mirbasetracker.org), an easy-to-use online database that keeps track of all historical and current miRNA annotation present in the miRBase database. Three basic functionalities allow researchers to keep their miRNA annotation up-to-date, reannotate analytical miRNA platforms and link published results with outdated annotation to the latest miRBase release.

Zawada,Ewa Damrath,Jessica Scheider,Juliane Schmäh,Ina Koch,Günter Kahl,Björn Rotter	NULL	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism that contributes to the sophisticated dynamics of gene regulation. Approximately 50% of all protein-coding human genes harbor multiple polyadenylation (PA) sites; their selective and combinatorial use gives rise to transcript variants with differing length of their 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). Shortened variants escape UTR-mediated regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), especially in cancer, where global 3′UTR shortening accelerates disease progression, dedifferentiation and proliferation. Here we present APADB, a database of vertebrate PA sites determined by 3′ end sequencing, using massive analysis of complementary DNA ends. APADB provides (A)PA sites for coding and non-coding transcripts of human, mouse and chicken genes. For human and mouse, several tissue types, including different cancer specimens, are available. APADB records the loss of predicted miRNA binding sites and visualizes next-generation sequencing reads that support each PA site in a genome browser. The database tables can either be browsed according to organism and tissue or alternatively searched for a gene of interest. APADB is the largest database of APA in human, chicken and mouse. The stored information provides experimental evidence for thousands of PA sites and APA events. APADB combines 3′ end sequencing data with prediction algorithms of miRNA binding sites, allowing to further improve prediction algorithms. Current databases lack correct information about 3′UTR lengths, especially for chicken, and APADB provides necessary information to close this gap.Database URL:http://tools.genxpro.net/apadb/	2014-07-21	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000339382200002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634812/APADB-a-database-for-alternative-polyadenylation	10.1093/database/bau076	24105322,21925375,20044349,17531405,22172994,21957004,9582195,22916029,12578839,18566288,20037631,17202160,16030070,23740743,23812974,24025092,22057158,15647503,24184689,23241633,19261174,20110278,12045153,15652477,21037258,10899149,21543442,23946503,19570905,24631284,20675343	http://tools.genxpro.net/apadb/,http://novocraft.com,http://www.djangoproject.com,https://github.com/bradleyayers/django-tables2,http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=11&types=bttttttt	NULL	APADB	http://tools.genxpro.net/apadb/	database

Sternberg,Yuqing Mao,Chih-Hsuan Wei,Zhiyong Lu	NULL	Gene function curation via Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is a common task among Model Organism Database groups. Owing to its manual nature, this task is considered one of the bottlenecks in literature curation. There have been many previous attempts at automatic identification of GO terms and supporting information from full text. However, few systems have delivered an accuracy that is comparable with humans. One recognized challenge in developing such systems is the lack of marked sentence-level evidence text that provides the basis for making GO annotations. We aim to create a corpus that includes the GO evidence text along with the three core elements of GO annotations: (i) a gene or gene product, (ii) a GO term and (iii) a GO evidence code. To ensure our results are consistent with real-life GO data, we recruited eight professional GO curators and asked them to follow their routine GO annotation protocols. Our annotators marked up more than 5000 text passages in 200 articles for 1356 distinct GO terms. For evidence sentence selection, the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) results are 9.3% (strict) and 42.7% (relaxed) in F1-measures. For GO term selection, the IAAs are 47% (strict) and 62.9% (hierarchical). Our corpus analysis further shows that abstracts contain ∼10% of relevant evidence sentences and 30% distinct GO terms, while the Results/Experiment section has nearly 60% relevant sentences and >70% GO terms. Further, of those evidence sentences found in abstracts, less than one-third contain enough experimental detail to fulfill the three core criteria of a GO annotation. This result demonstrates the need of using full-text articles for text mining GO annotations. Through its use at the BioCreative IV GO (BC4GO) task, we expect our corpus to become a valuable resource for the BioNLP research community.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/bc-iv-go-task-corpus/.	2014-07-28	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000339797100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634768/BC4GO-a-full-text-corpus-for-the-BioCreative-IV-GO	10.1093/database/bau074	10802651,23842463,19921742,23327938,17634621,22301074,18957448,23221298,18271954,23327936,22151647,22685160,19622167,23221175,23160414,23703206,21998156,11779846,17620146,19622167,21411447,22434836,22434844,23842461,18325104,15960828,23160416,15960829,18834500,18834495,22776079,12855455,18834493,24393765,23842463,21094696,24048470,15960829,6344946,21613640,24852177	http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/bc-iv-go-task-corpus/,http://www.geneontology.org,http://flybase.org/,http://www.maizegdb.org/,http://rgd.mcw.edu/,http://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://www.wormbase.org/,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.shtml	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/bc-iv-go-task-corpus/	NULL

Despite the availability of numerous methods and techniques for various text-mining tasks, combining different tools requires substantial efforts and time owing to heterogeneity and variety in data formats. In response, BioC is a recent proposal that offers a minimalistic approach to tool interoperability by stipulating minimal changes to existing tools and applications. BioC is a family of XML formats that define how to present text documents and annotations, and also provides easy-to-use functions to read/write documents in the BioC format. In this study, we introduce our text-mining toolkit, which is designed to perform several challenging and significant tasks in the biomedical domain, and repackage the toolkit into BioC to enhance its interoperability.Our toolkit consists of six state-of-the-art tools for named-entity recognition, normalization and annotation (PubTator) of genes (GenNorm), diseases (DNorm), mutations (tmVar), species (SR4GN) and chemicals (tmChem). Although developed within the same group, each tool is designed to process input articles and output annotations in a different format. We modify these tools and enable them to read/write data in the proposed BioC format. We find that, using the BioC family of formats and functions, only minimal changes were required to build the newer versions of the tools. The resulting BioC wrapped toolkit, which we have namedtmBioC, consists of our tools in BioC, an annotated full-text corpus in BioC, and a format detection and conversion tool.Furthermore, through participation in the 2013 BioCreative IV Interoperability Track, we empirically demonstrate that the tools intmBioCcan be more efficiently integrated with each other as well as with external tools: Our experimental results show that using BioC reduces >60% in lines of code for text-mining tool integration.

Many of these studies (such as effects of oxygen concentration, temperature stress, low pH stress, osmotic stress, depletion or limitation of nutrients, addition of different chemical compounds, etc.) have been conducted in the unicellular Eukaryal model, yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the lack of a unifying or integrated, bioinformatics platform that would permit efficient and rapid use of all these existing data remain an important issue. To facilitate research by exploiting existing transcription data in the field of yeast physiology, we have developed the yStreX database. It is an online repository of analyzed gene expression data from curated data sets from different studies that capture genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to diverse environmental transitions. The first aim of this online database is to facilitate comparison of cross-platform and cross-laboratory gene expression data. Additionally, we performed different expression analyses, meta-analyses and gene set enrichment analyses; and the results are also deposited in this database.

John Wilbur	NULL	The time-consuming nature of manual curation and the rapid growth of biomedical literature severely limit the number of articles that database curators can scrutinize and annotate. Hence, semi-automatic tools can be a valid support to increase annotation throughput. Although a handful of curation assistant tools are already available, to date, little has been done to formally evaluate their benefit to biocuration. Moreover, most curation tools are designed for specific problems. Thus, it is not easy to apply an annotation tool for multiple tasks. BioQRator is a publicly available web-based tool for annotating biomedical literature. It was designed to support general tasks, i.e. any task annotating entities and relationships. In the BioCreative IV edition, BioQRator was tailored for protein– protein interaction (PPI) annotation by migrating information from PIEthe search. The results obtained from six curators showed that the precision on the top 10 documents doubled with PIEthe searchcompared with PubMed search results. It was also observed that the annotation time for a full PPI annotation task decreased for a beginner-intermediate level annotator. This finding is encouraging because text-mining techniques were not directly involved in the full annotation task and BioQRator can be easily integrated with any text-mining resources.Database URL:http://www.bioqrator.org/	2014-07-21	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000339382100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634667/Assisting-manual-literature-curation-for-protein	10.1093/database/bau067	18834499,17646325,15826357,18834487,22151647,19814812,19622167,22151929,23150036,18834498,23255168,22199390,22151252	http://www.bioqrator.org/,http://thebiogrid.org,http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it,http://trpchannel.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioQRator	http://www.bioqrator.org/	NULL

The aims of ChiloDB are (i) to store recently acquired genomic sequence and transcriptome data and integrate them with protein-coding genes, microRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and (ii) to provide comprehensive search tools and downloadable data sets for comparative genomics and gene annotation of this important rice pest. ChiloDB contains the first version of the official SSB gene set, comprising 80 479 scaffolds and 10 221 annotated protein-coding genes. Additionally, 262 SSB microRNA genes predicted from a small RNA library, 82 639 piRNAs identified using the piRNApredictor software, 37 040 transcripts from a midgut transcriptome and 69 977 transcripts from a mixed sample have all been integrated into ChiloDB. ChiloDB was constructed using a data structure that is compatible with data resources, which will be incorporated into the database in the future.

Current essential gene databases provide only binary essentiality data from genome-wide experiments. We therefore developed a new database that Integrates quantitative Fitness Information for Microbial genes (IFIM). The IFIM database currently contains data from 16 experiments and 2186 theoretical predictions. The highly significant correlation between the experiment-derived fitness data and our computational simulations demonstrated that the computer-generated predictions were often as reliable as the experimental data. The data in IFIM can be accessed easily, and the interface allows users to browse through the gene fitness information that it contains. IFIM is the first resource that allows easy access to fitness data of microbial genes. We believe this database will contribute to a better understanding of microbial genetics and will be useful in designing drugs to resist microbial pathogens, especially when experimental data are unavailable.Database URL:http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ifim/orhttp://cefg.cn/ifim/	2014-06-11	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000338573500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634425/IFIM-a-database-of-integrated-fitness-information	10.1093/database/bau052	22951051,23219343,18319726,16477005,11567142,23977285,22355572,19943957,22768221,12556881,12045149,23914835,23271269,20226027,23297387,22356628,20695823,18974178,22075992,12679525,22646920,9399804,23193287,22319151,24209780	http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ifim/,http://cefg.cn/ifim/,http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/geptop/,http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/,http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ifim/,http://cefg.cn/ifim/,http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ifim/	NULL	NULL	IFIM	http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ifim/	database

We have provided comprehensive information about these peptides that include peptide sequence, chemical modifications, stereochemistry, antiparasitic activity, origin, nature of peptide, assay types, type of parasite, mode of action and hemolytic activity. Structures of peptides consisting of natural, as well as modified amino acids have been determined using state-of-the-art software, PEPstr. To facilitate users, various user-friendly web tools, for data fetching, analysis and browsing, have been integrated. We hope that ParaPep will be advantageous in designing therapeutic peptides against parasitic diseases.Database URL:http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/parapep/	2014-06-12	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbau051%2f2634416%2fParaPep-a-web-resource-for-experimentally	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634416/ParaPep-a-web-resource-for-experimentally	10.1093/database/bau051	20606973,23615879,21728986,23253135,19879957,20687878,22664071,24287494,19817857,19923233,18957441,22110032,17897087,10869041,15145798,16200636,18704948,21071423,21982300,19434905,10547837,22403286,22205159,23180797,22523575,24174543	http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/parapep/,http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about.html,http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/drug_resistance.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	ParaPep	http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/parapep/	NULL

As manual annotation is a demanding and expensive task, computerized solutions were developed to perform such tasks automatically. However, high-end information extraction techniques are still not widely used by biomedical research communities, mainly because of the lack of standards and limitations in usability. Interactive annotation tools intend to fill this gap, taking advantage of automatic techniques and existing knowledge bases to assist expert curators in their daily tasks. This article presents Egas, a web-based platform for biomedical text mining and assisted curation with highly usable interfaces for manual and automatic in-line annotation of concepts and relations. A comprehensive set of de facto standard knowledge bases are integrated and indexed to provide straightforward concept normalization features. Real-time collaboration and conversation functionalities allow discussing details of the annotation task as well as providing instant feedback of curator’s interactions. Egas also provides interfaces for on-demand management of the annotation task settings and guidelines, and supports standard formats and literature services to import and export documents. By taking advantage of Egas, we participated in the BioCreative IV interactive annotation task, targeting the assisted identification of protein–protein interactions described in PubMed abstracts related to neuropathological disorders. When evaluated by expert curators, it obtained positive scores in terms of usability, reliability and performance. These results, together with the provided innovative features, place Egas as a state-of-the-art solution for fast and accurate curation of information, facilitating the task of creating and updating knowledge bases and annotated resources.Database URL:http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/egas	2014-06-11	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbau048%2f2634361%2fEgas-a-collaborative-and-interactive-document	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634361/Egas-a-collaborative-and-interactive-document	10.1093/database/bau048	15960821,17646325,22901054,24063607,21062765,18410678,19073592,18834495,22151929,18834493,18834494,22789588,23703206,23736528,22776079,23413997,17989687,16697710,22139910,20935045,10802651,17932057,22080554,21926441,17291334	http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/egas,http://www.bioqrator.org,http://141.20.31.85/cellfinder,http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/rlimsp,https://www.tagtog.net,http://www.isi.edu/projects/sciknowmine/overview,http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/MarkerRIF,http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html,http://www.mysql.com,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/BioC,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/oa-service,http://lucene.apache.org/solr,https://togetherjs.com,http://nodejs.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43082/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	Egas	http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/egas	platform

Comeau,Lana Yeganova,W. John Wilbur	NULL	BioC is a recently created XML format to share text data and annotations, and an accompanying input/output library to promote interoperability of data and tools for natural language processing of biomedical text. This article reports the use of BioC to address a common challenge in processing biomedical text information—that of frequent entity name abbreviation. We selected three different abbreviation definition identification modules, and used the publicly available BioC code to convert these independent modules into BioC-compatible components that interact seamlessly with BioC-formatted data, and other BioC-compatible modules. In addition, we consider four manually annotated corpora of abbreviations in biomedical text: the Ab3P corpus of 1250 PubMed abstracts, the BIOADI corpus of 1201 PubMed abstracts, the old MEDSTRACT corpus of 199 PubMed®citations and the Schwartz and Hearst corpus of 1000 PubMed abstracts. Annotations in these corpora have been re-evaluated by four annotators and their consistency and quality levels have been improved. We converted them to BioC-format and described the representation of the annotations. These corpora are used to measure the three abbreviation-finding algorithms and the results are given. The BioC-compatible modules, when compared with their original form, have no difference in their efficiency, running time or any other comparable aspects. They can be conveniently used as a common pre-processing step for larger multi-layered text-mining endeavors.Database URL: Code and data are available for download at the BioC site:http://bioc.sourceforge.net.	2014-06-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000338571000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634328/Finding-abbreviations-in-biomedical-literature	10.1093/database/bau044	15960821,18834487,22151647,23221175,20157491,18817555,19958517,21658293,11604766	http://bioc.sourceforge.net,http://www.biocreative.org/,http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/track-1-interoperability/,http://biotext.berkeley.edu/software.html,http://www.medstract.org,http://www.wordle.net/create,http://www.wordle.net/create,http://bioc.sourceforge.net	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioC-compatible	http://bioc.sourceforge.net	NULL

They play important roles in modulating various biological functions. Current PTM databases contain important sequence annotations but do not provide informative 3D structural resource about these modifications. Posttranslational modification structural database (PTM-SD) provides access to structurally solved modified residues, which are experimentally annotated as PTMs. It combines different PTM information and annotation gathered from other databases, e.g.Protein DataBank for the protein structures and dbPTM and PTMCuration for fine sequence annotation. PTM-SD gives an accurate detection of PTMs in structural data. PTM-SD can be browsed by PDB id, UniProt accession number, organism and classic PTM annotation. Advanced queries can also be performed, i.e.detailed PTM annotations, amino acid type, secondary structure, SCOP class classification, PDB chain length and number of PTMs by chain. Statistics and analyses can be computed on a selected dataset of PTMs. Each PTM entry is detailed in a dedicated page with information on the protein sequence, local conformation with secondary structure and Protein Blocks. PTM-SD gives valuable information on observed PTMs in protein 3D structure, which is of great interest for studying sequence–structure– function relationships at the light of PTMs, and could provide insights for comparative modeling and PTM predictions protocols.Database URL:PTM-SD can be accessed athttp://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/.	2014-05-24	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336257400002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634283/PTM-SD-a-database-of-structurally-resolved-and	10.1093/database/bau041	10966463,22438791,22128902,20495563,23198822,20461098,22135298,10356335,22947645,23516343,22884395,21983556,23193290,23193284,20965970,10592235,21062810,21731588,21447597,6667333,11025540,21586582,22676903,17389049,20525797,20028521,18763837,18000004,20567261,15175333,17846036,8254673,15174122,17202164,21045056,23104379,9847232,22039152	http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/,http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/,http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/correspondence_table.html,https://github.com/pierrepo/PBxplore,http://www.pymol.org,http://www.highcharts.com,http://cran.r-project.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=5&types=tttttttt	NULL	PTM-SD	http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/	database

By adopting the BioC format, we aim to make iSimp readily interoperable with other applications in the biomedical domain. To examine the utility of iSimp in BioC, we implemented a rule-based relation extraction system that uses iSimp as a preprocessing module and BioC for data exchange. Evaluation on the training corpus of BioNLP-ST 2011 GENIA Event Extraction (GE) task showed that iSimp sentence simplification improved the recall by 3.2% without reducing precision.

Cryptochromes are clustered into three subfamilies: plant-type cryptochromes, animal-type cryptochromes and cryptochrome-DASH proteins. These subfamilies are composed of photolyase/cryptochrome superfamily with 6–4 photolyase and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase. Cryptochromes have conserved domain architectures with two distinct domains, an N-terminal photolyase-related domain and a C-terminal domain. Although the molecular function and domain architecture of cryptochromes are conserved, their molecular mechanisms differ between plants and animals. Thus, cryptochromes are one of the best candidates for comparative and evolutionary studies. Here, we have developed a Web-based platform for comparative and evolutionary studies of cryptochromes, dbCRY (http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/). A pipeline built upon the consensus domain profile was applied to 1438 genomes and identified 1309 genes. To support comparative and evolutionary genomics studies, the Web interface provides diverse functions such as (i) browsing by species, (ii) protein domain analysis, (iii) multiple sequence alignment, (iv) homology search and (v) extended analysis opportunities through the implementation of ‘Favorite Browser’ powered by the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform 2.0 (CFGP 2.0;http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/). dbCRY would serve as a standardized and systematic solution for cryptochrome genomics studies.Database URL:http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/	2014-05-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336257000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634222/dbCRY-a-Web-based-comparative-and-evolutionary	10.1093/database/bau037	14503000,8232555,9845369,10971654,11904144,8909283,10966452,8600518,15892880,10221900,10806223,9342401,16125004,7732376,21526969,23161681,20444223,20305004,17545314,12535521,15147276,23193288,10871367,12878596,17210647,16478995,11114337	http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/,http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/,http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/,http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/,http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/	NULL	NULL	dbCRY	http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/	platform

Recent data from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation technologies confirmed the combinatorial nature of the miRNA regulation. We present the miRror-Suite platform, developed to yield a robust and concise explanation for miRNA regulation from a large collection of differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs. The miRror-Suite platform includes the miRror2.0 and Probability Supported Iterative miRror (PSI-miRror) tools. Researchers who performed large-scale transcriptomics or miRNA profiling experiments from cells and tissues will benefit from miRror-Suite. Our platform provides a concise, plausible explanation for the regulation of miRNAs in such complex settings. The input for miRror2.0 may include hundreds of differentially expressed genes or miRNAs. In the case of miRNAs as input, the algorithm seeks the statistically most likely set of genes regulated by this input. Alternatively, for a set of genes, the miRror algorithm seeks a collection of miRNAs that best explains their regulation. The miRror-Suite algorithm designates statistical criteria that were uniformly applied to a dozen miRNA-target prediction databases. Users select the preferred databases for predictions and numerous optional filters/parameters that restrict the search to the desired tissues, cell lines, level of expression and predictor scores. PSI-miRror is an advanced application for refining the input set by gradually enhancing the degree of pairing of the sets of miRNAs with the sets of targets. The iterations of PSI-miRror probe the interlinked nature of miRNAs and targets within cells. miRror-Suite serves experimentalists in facilitating the understanding of miRNA regulation through combinatorial– cooperative activity.

Defelipe,Esteban Lanzarotti,Javier Luque,Xavier Barril,Marcelo A. Marti,Adrián G. Turjanski	NULL	In 2012 an estimated 8.6 million people developed tuberculosis (TB) and 1.3 million died from the disease [including 320 000 deaths among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive people]. There is an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs owing to the following: the fact that current treatments have severe side effects, the increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), the negative drug–drug interactions with certain HIV (or other disease) treatments and the ineffectiveness against dormantMtb. In this context we present here the TuberQ database, a novel resource for all researchers working in the field of drug development in TB. The main feature of TuberQ is to provide a druggability analysis ofMtbproteins in a consistent and effective manner, contributing to a better selection of potential drug targets for screening campaigns and the analysis of targets for structure-based drug design projects. The structural druggability analysis is combined with features related to the characteristics of putative inhibitor binding pockets and with functional and biological data of proteins. The structural analysis is performed on all available uniqueMtbstructures and high-quality structural homology-based models. This information is shown in an interactive manner, depicting the protein structure, the pockets and the associated characteristics for each protein. TuberQ also provides information about gene essentiality information, as determined from whole cell–based knockout experiments, and expression information obtained from microarray experiments done in different stress-related conditions. We hope that TuberQ will be a powerful tool for researchers working in TB and eventually will lead to the identification of novel putative targets and progresses in therapeutic activities.Database URL:http://tuberq.proteinq.com.ar/	2014-05-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336256800001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634183/TuberQ-a-Mycobacterium-tuberculosis-protein	10.1093/database/bau035	21270886,20466922,20980199,18835847,18927591,10356246,20684613,12209152,20977231,17965183,21079673,17570152,19434839,12657046,17555602,16261191,21734908,11929527,15207492,15207493,15608701,15608167,20718988,2231712,12037327,9634230,17655757,21980284,16731699,18542861,9254694,17905832,17932912,19486540,14681376,14681378,8744570,21995295,19746440,20945875,20685398,22148551,22834646,22448735,22628523,19099550,17555602,19833135	http://tuberq.proteinq.com.ar/,http://www.uniprot.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/CSA/,http://tuberq.proteinq.com.ar/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	TuberQ	http://tuberq.proteinq.com.ar/	database

Owing to an increasing number ofin vivophosphorylation sites that have been identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the RegPhos, available online athttp://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/, was developed to explore protein phosphorylation networks in human. In this update, we not only enhance the data content in human but also investigate kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in mouse and rat. The experimentally validated phosphorylation sites as well as their catalytic kinases were extracted from public resources, and MS/MS phosphopeptides were manually curated from research articles. RegPhos 2.0 aims to provide a more comprehensive view of intracellular signaling networks by integrating the information of metabolic pathways and protein–protein interactions. A case study shows that analyzing the phosphoproteome profile of time-dependent cell activation obtained from Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the RegPhos deciphered not only the consistent scheme in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway but also novel regulatory molecules that may involve in it. With an attempt to help users efficiently identify the candidate biomarkers in cancers, 30 microarray experiments, including 39 cancerous versus normal cells, were analyzed for detecting cancer-specific expressed genes coding for kinases and their substrates.

To keep abreast of these increases, FlyBase, a database for Drosophila genomic and genetic information, is constantly exploring new ways to mine the published literature to increase the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation and to automate some aspects, such as triaging and entity extraction. Toward this end, we present the ‘tagtog’ system, a web-based annotation framework that can be used to mark up biological entities (such as genes) and concepts (such as Gene Ontology terms) in full-text articles. tagtog leverages manual user annotation in combination with automatic machine-learned annotation to provide accurate identification of gene symbols and gene names. As part of the BioCreative IV Interactive Annotation Task, FlyBase has used tagtog to identify and extract mentions ofDrosophila melanogastergene symbols and names in full-text biomedical articles from the PLOS stable of journals. We show here the results of three experiments with different sized corpora and assess gene recognition performance and curation speed.

The abundance of predictedcis-sequences is a major challenge to associate these sequences with a possible function in gene expression regulation. To identify a possible function of the predictedcis-sequences, a novel web tool designated ‘in silicoexpression analysis’ was developed that correlates submittedcis-sequences with gene expression data fromArabidopsis thaliana. The web tool identifies theA. thalianagenes harbouring the sequence in a defined promoter region and compares the expression of these genes with microarray data. The result is a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic stress conditions to which these genes are most likely responsive. When testing the performance of the web tool, knowncis-regulatory sequences were submitted to the ‘in silicoexpression analysis’ resulting in the correct identification of the associated stress conditions. When using a recently identified novel elicitor-responsive sequence, a WT-box (CGACTTTT), the ‘in silicoexpression analysis’ predicts that genes harbouring this sequence in their promoter are most likelyBotrytis cinereainduced.

Discerning different components that contribute toward a favorable protein– ligand interaction could contribute significantly toward better understanding protein function, rationalizing drug design and obtaining design principles for protein engineering. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) currently hosts the structure of ∼68 000 protein–ligand complexes. Although several databases exist that classify proteins according to sequence and structure, a mere handful of them annotate and classify protein–ligand interactions and provide information on different attributes of molecular recognition. In this study, an exhaustive comparison of all the biologically relevant ligand-binding sites (84 846 sites) has been conducted using PocketMatch: a rapid, parallel, in-house algorithm. PocketMatch quantifies the similarity between binding sites based on structural descriptors and residue attributes. A similarity network was constructed using binding sites whose PocketMatch scores exceeded a high similarity threshold (0.80). The binding site similarity network was clustered into discrete sets of similar sites using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm. Furthermore, various computational tools have been used to study different attributes of interactions within the individual clusters. The attributes can be roughly divided into (i) binding site characteristics including pocket shape, nature of residues and interaction profiles with different kinds of atomic probes, (ii) atomic contacts consisting of various types of polar, hydrophobic and aromatic contacts along with binding site water molecules that could play crucial roles in protein–ligand interactions and (iii) binding energetics involved in interactions derived from scoring functions developed for docking. For each ligand-binding site in each protein in the PDB, site similarity information, clusters they belong to and description of site attributes are provided as a relational database—protein–ligand interaction clusters (PLIC).Database URL:http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/PLIC	2014-04-23	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000334921500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634082/PLIC-protein-ligand-interaction-clusters	10.1093/database/bau029	23087378,23868908,22135290,22080553,12559926,21398668,22600737,23196990,20058856,19997483,22102591,19091072,21662242,15163179,18004762,16299776,19217394,22144159,20478829,8723313,19789268,21982300,15980496,23193259,14681372,21097779,11125043,19920124,10802651,18940862,23203869,18055497,17145705,11096166,8508427,342086,21919503,24005320	http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/PLIC,http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/PLIC/excluded_ligands.txt,http://php.net,http://jmol.sourceforge.net/,http://www.highcharts.com/,http://jquery.com/	NULL	NULL	PLIC	http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/PLIC	NULL

Thomas,Einar Ryeng,Finn Drabløs,Pål Sætrom	NULL	Systematic data management and controlled data sharing aim at increasing reproducibility, reducing redundancy in work, and providing a way to efficiently locate complementing or contradicting information. One method of achieving this is collecting data in a central repository or in a location that is part of a federated system and providing interfaces to the data. However, certain data, such as data from biobanks or clinical studies, may, for legal and privacy reasons, often not be stored in public repositories. Instead, we describe a metadata cataloguing system and a software suite for reporting the presence of data from the life sciences domain. The system stores three types of metadata: file information, file provenance and data lineage, and content descriptions. Our software suite includes both graphical and command line interfaces that allow users to report and tag files with these different metadata types. Importantly, the files remain in their original locations with their existing access-control mechanisms in place, while our system provides descriptions of their contents and relationships. Our system and software suite thereby provide a common framework for cataloguing and sharing both public and private data.Database URL:http://bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/data/eGenVar/	2014-03-28	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000334162100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634026/The-eGenVar-data-management-system-cataloguing-and	10.1093/database/bau027	18836194,23193287,22955616,23128226,20393554,22820252,22955828,19174838,23193272,23329047,21921928,21943917,20679334,18688244,11726920,21071405,20738864,23640334,22879362,18385738,22885922,22242009,23749187,21131975,23793025,22432041,17701901,21906284,22103807	http://bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/data/eGenVar/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap,https://www.synapse.org/,http://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k/,http://www.elixir-europe.org/,http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/,http://obofoundry.org/,http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/,http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/,http://db.apache.org/derby/,http://www.mysql.com/,http://bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/data/eGenVar/,http://www.netfilter.org/,http://www.ntnu.edu/hunt,https://www.irods.org/,http://ximbiot.com/cvs/,http://subversion.apache.org/,http://git-scm.com/,http://thedata.org/,http://datadryad.org/,http://glassfish.java.net/,http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/,http://www.elixir-europe.org/,http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/,https://netbeans.org/,http://glassfish.java.net/,http://www.mysql.com/,http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/xml/jax-ws/,https://jaxb.java.net/,http://code.google.com/p/zxing/,http://mail.google.com/,http://trac.edgewall.org/,http://mibbi.sourceforge.net/portal.shtml,http://obofoundry.org/,http://www.sequenceontology.org/,http://mibbi.sourceforge.net/portal.shtml,http://obofoundry.org/,http://www.sequenceontology.org/,https://github.com/Sabryr/EGDMS	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	eGenVar	http://bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/data/eGenVar/	NULL

Joseph,Prashant Shingate,Atul K. Upadhyay,R. Sowdhamini	NULL	Protein domain families are usually classified on the basis of similarity of amino acid sequences. Selection of a single representative sequence for each family provides targets for structure determination or modeling and also enables fast sequence searches to associate new members to a family. Such a selection could be challenging since some of these domain families exhibit huge variation depending on the number of members in the family, the average family sequence length or the extent of sequence divergence within a family. We had earlier created 3PFDB database as a repository of best representative sequences, selected from each PFAM domain family on the basis of high coverage. In this study, we have improved the database using more efficient strategies for the initial generation of sequence profiles and implement two independent methods, FASSM and HMMER, for identifying family members. HMMER employs a global sequence similarity search, while FASSM relies on motif identification and matching. This improved and updated database, 3PFDB+ generated in this study, provides representative sequences and profiles for PFAM families, with 13 519 family representatives having more than 90% family coverage. The representative sequence is also highlighted in a two-dimensional plot, which reflects the relative divergence between family members. Representatives belonging to small families with short sequences are mainly associated with low coverage. The set of sequences not recognized by the family representative profiles, highlight several potential false or weak family associations in PFAM. Partial domains and fragments dominate such cases, along with sequences that are highly diverged or different from other family members. Some of these outliers were also predicted to have different secondary structure contents, which reflect different putative structure or functional roles for these domain sequences.Database URL:http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdbplus/	2014-04-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000341703400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2634009/3PFDB-improved-search-protocol-and-update-for-the	10.1093/database/bau026	10940251,7723011,19920124,12112669,20686689,19961575,22039361,16268788,11752315,2231712,9254694,8743706,9632836,11152613,7667876,22127870,24253303,10802651	http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdbplus/,http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdbplus/PFAM_BRP/	NULL	NULL	3PFDB+	http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdbplus/	NULL

The development of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has resulted in a rapid increase of PTMs identified on proteins from different species. The collection and systematic ordering of PTM data should provide invaluable information for understanding cellular processes and signaling pathways regulated by PTMs. For this original purpose we developed SysPTM, a systematic resource installed with comprehensive PTM data and a suite of web tools for annotation of PTMs in 2009. Four years later, there has been a significant advance with the generation of PTM data and, consequently, more sophisticated analysis requirements have to be met. Here we submit an updated version of SysPTM 2.0 (http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SysPTM/), with almost doubled data content, enhanced web-based analysis tools of PTMBlast, PTMPathway, PTMPhylog, PTMCluster. Moreover, a new session SysPTM-H is constructed to graphically represent the combinatorial histone PTMs and dynamic regulation of histone modifying enzymes, and a new tool PTMGO is added for functional annotation and enrichment analysis. SysPTM 2.0 not only facilitates resourceful annotation of PTM sites but allows systematic investigation of PTM functions by the user.Citation details:Li,J., Jia,J., Li,H.et al.SysPTM 2.0: an updated systematic resource for post-translational modification.Database(2014) Vol. 2014: article ID bau025; doi:10.1093/database/bau025.Database URL:http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SysPTM/	2014-04-03	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000341702500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633959/SysPTM-2-0-an-updated-systematic-resource-for-post	10.1093/database/bau025	14761301,12610572,11283354,16095902,17901869,19743430,20631208,9847232,21062810,15174126,21081558,23161681,18988627,22135298,23193284,19366988,20585580,23173045,21149613,20100358,22948226,17442109,16845004,15539450,19689425,23193264,22140112,22194010,21529160,21139605,22080510,10802651,22127870,23193259,21472891,23203987,22140109,23125371,22067452,23175615,15174122,7265238,23264621,22593584,20956806,19638616,21273632,15201400,15965474,17893677,12648672,15656914,23227340,22902405,16606683,21886846,23749302,16723975,22806145,23749301	http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SysPTM/,http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SysPTM/	NULL	NULL	SysPTM	http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SysPTM/	NULL

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that epigenetics and miRNA can affect each other in various ways. In this study, we established the EpimiR database, which collects 1974 regulations between 19 kinds of epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, H3K4me3, H3S10p) and 617 miRNAs across seven species (includingHomo sapiens,Mus musculus,Rattus norvegicus,Gallus gallus, Epstein–Barr virus,Canis familiarisandArabidopsis thaliana) from >300 references in the literature. These regulations can be divided into two parts: miR2Epi (103 entries describing how miRNA regulates epigenetic modification) and Epi2miR (1871 entries describing how epigenetic modification affects miRNA). Each entry of EpimiR not only contains basic descriptions of the validated experiment (method, species, reference and so on) but also clearly illuminates the regulatory pathway between epigenetics and miRNA. As a supplement to the curated information, the EpimiR extends to gather predicted epigenetic features (such as predicted transcription start site, upstream CpG island) associated with miRNA for users to guide their future biological experiments. Finally, EpimiR offers download and submission pages. Thus, EpimiR provides a fairly comprehensive repository about the mutual regulation between epigenetic modifications and miRNAs, which will promote the research on the regulatory mechanism of epigenetics and miRNA.Database URL:http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/EpimiR/.	2014-03-28	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000334162000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633891/EpimiR-a-database-of-curated-mutual-regulation	10.1093/database/bau023	15164071,18463664,11782440,12209141,21116306,18197166,16446010,18538733,23410973,21734013,21873453,23398123,17012846,16452179,21660058,19211935,21837748,21897363,22264793,18045790,21821656,20959295,14697198	http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/EpimiR/,http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/EpimiR/	NULL	NULL	EpimiR	http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/EpimiR/	database

Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers >4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.Database URL:http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/	2014-03-18	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336255800002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633820/DBatVir-the-database-of-bat-associated-viruses	10.1093/database/bau021	18288193,16485468,18845749,16195424,23075143,23990536,16847084,17042030,23265969,20463061,20926577,22216187,22345464,22855479,22937142,23562481,23630620,23739658,23939976,24027312,23193287,23193299,21327164,9254694,15034147,20224823,20805892,22531181,18258002,24172901	http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/,http://www.iucnredlist.org,http://www.sencha.com/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	DBatVir	http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/	database

Ciccarelli	NULL	NCG 4.0 is the latest update of the Network of Cancer Genes, a web-based repository of systems-level properties of cancer genes. In its current version, the database collects information on 537 known (i.e. experimentally supported) and 1463 candidate (i.e. inferred using statistical methods) cancer genes. Candidate cancer genes derive from the manual revision of 67 original publications describing the mutational screening of 3460 human exomes and genomes in 23 different cancer types. For all 2000 cancer genes, duplicability, evolutionary origin, expression, functional annotation, interaction network with other human proteins and with microRNAs are reported. In addition to providing a substantial update of cancer-related information, NCG 4.0 also introduces two new features. The first is the annotation of possible false-positive cancer drivers, defined as candidate cancer genes inferred from large-scale screenings whose association with cancer is likely to be spurious. The second is the description of the systems-level properties of 64 human microRNAs that are causally involved in cancer progression (oncomiRs). Owing to the manual revision of all information, NCG 4.0 constitutes a complete and reliable resource on human coding and non-coding genes whose deregulation drives cancer onset and/or progression. NCG 4.0 can also be downloaded as a free application for Android smart phones.Database URL:http://bio.ieo.eu/ncg/	2014-03-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336255100002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633800/NCG-4-0-the-network-of-cancer-genes-in-the-era-of	10.1093/database/bau015	23540688,19360079,23539594,22080562,19906700,23718799,23770567,18675489,23161678,16885332,19763153,20952405,11257097,14993899,20029424,21798897,22722202,22610119,20601955,22622578,21307934,21817013,23103869,21430775,20126413,20054297,20393555,18948947,22634756,22722839,21339757,21822268,22561517,22960745,22922871,22980975,21252315,22832583,18772397,20668451,23000897,23104009,20505728,18987736,21822264,22094584,23143597,19657110,21796119,22810696,18772890,22561520,18772396,21163964,21804550,22941188,23222956,20016485,20016488,21642962,22820256,22158541,23143595,22722829,22941189,23202128,22286061,19812674,22722201,21798893,21499249,22183965,21248752,22037554,22156295,21499247,17932254,21399634,21909114,22484628,22121212,22096231,21490719,20492640,18988627,23203989,22121220,19897547,14681454,18957447,18996891,21071411,22759861,16959974,16783027,15950434,14960456,12490442,16557279,17028598,22337054,18685719,19410551,23410973,21037258,14744438,20656902	http://bio.ieo.eu/ncg/,http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=13&types=bbtwffgg	NULL	NCG	http://bio.ieo.eu/ncg/	NULL

But the identified targets of a given TF consist of both direct and indirect regulatory targets. It has been shown that most of the TFPE-identified regulatory targets are indirect, indicating that TF-gene regulation is mainly through transcriptional regulatory pathways (TRPs) consisting of intermediate TFs. Without identification of these TRPs, it is not easy to understand how a TF regulates its indirect targets. Because there is no such database depositing the potential TRPs forSaccharomyces cerevisiaenow, this motivates us to construct the YTRP (Yeast Transcriptional Regulatory Pathway) database. For each TF-gene regulatory pair under different experimental conditions, all possible TRPs in two underlying networks (constructed using experimentally verified TF-gene binding pairs and TF-gene regulatory pairs from the literature) for the specified experimental conditions were automatically enumerated by TRP mining procedures developed from the graph theory. The enumerated TRPs of a TF-gene regulatory pair provide experimentally testable hypotheses for the molecular mechanisms behind a TF and its regulatory target. YTRP is available online athttp://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/. We believe that the TRPs deposited in this database will greatly improve the usefulness of TFPE data for yeast biologists to study the regulatory mechanisms between a TF and its knocked-out targets.Database URL:http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/	2014-03-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000336255100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633798/YTRP-a-repository-for-yeast-transcriptional	10.1093/database/bau014	16455487,17417638,11125145,19536199,22898448,20972212,24170807,17975075,15486203,20230615,19638617,17646318,18319721,19234470,21586587,11701654,15372033,19380492,9171383	http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/,http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/,http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/	NULL	NULL	YTRP	http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YTRP/	repository

These proteins control the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and probably many other cellular processes as well. This large protein group is formed by a family of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic homologs that have phylogenetic relationships with BCL-2, and by a collection of evolutionarily and structurally unrelated proteins characterized by the presence of a region of local sequence similarity with BCL-2, termed the BH3 motif. BCL2DB is monthly built, thanks to an automated procedure relying on a set of homemade profile HMMs computed from seed reference sequences representative of the various BCL-2 homologs and BH3-only proteins. The BCL2DB entries integrate data from the Ensembl, Ensembl Genomes, European Nucleotide Archive and Protein Data Bank databases and are enriched with specific information like protein classification into orthology groups and distribution of BH motifs along the sequences. The Web interface allows for easy browsing of the site and fast access to data, as well as sequence analysis with generic and specific tools.

Currently, such information is manually curated from the literature, obtained from high-throughput microscopy-based screens and predicted from primary sequence. To get a comprehensive view of the localization of a protein, it is thus necessary to consult multiple databases and prediction tools. To address this, we present the COMPARTMENTS resource, which integrates all sources listed above as well as the results of automatic text mining. The resource is automatically kept up to date with source databases, and all localization evidence is mapped onto common protein identifiers and Gene Ontology terms. We further assign confidence scores to the localization evidence to facilitate comparison of different types and sources of evidence. To further improve the comparability, we assign confidence scores based on the type and source of the localization evidence.

Accurately annotating all transcripts of a gene is crucial. It is needed to understand the impact of mutations on phenotypes, to shed light on genetic and epigenetic regulation of mRNAs and more generally to widen our knowledge about cell functionality and tissue diversity. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the other applications of the next-generation sequencing, provides precious data to improve annotations' accuracy, simultaneously creating issues related to the variety, complexity and the size of produced data. In this ‘scenario’, the lack of user-friendly resources, easily accessible to researchers with low skills in bioinformatics, makes difficult to retrieve complete information about one or few genes without browsing a jungle of databases. Concordantly, the increasing amount of data from ‘omics’ technologies imposes to develop integrated databases merging different data formats coming from distinct but complementary sources. In light of these considerations, and given the wide interest in studying Down syndrome—a genetic condition due to the trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21)—we developed an integrated relational database and a web interface, named ALE-HSA21 (AnaLysis of Expression on HSA21), accessible athttp://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21. This comprehensive and user-friendly web resource integrates—for all coding and noncoding transcripts of chromosome 21—existing gene annotations and transcripts identifiedde novothrough RNA-Seq analysis with predictive computational analysis of regulatory sequences. Given the role of noncoding RNAs and untranslated regions of coding genes in key regulatory mechanisms, ALE-HSA21 is also an interesting web-based platform to investigate such processes. The ‘transcript-centric’ and easily-accessible nature of ALE-HSA21 makes this resource a valuable tool to rapidly retrieve data at the isoform level, rather than at gene level, useful to investigate any disease, molecular pathway or cell process involving chromosome 21 genes.Database URL:http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21/	2014-02-25	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000334511400001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633784/AnaLysis-of-Expression-on-human-chromosome-21-ALE	10.1093/database/bau009	17510325,17571346,19920851,21765801,10932196,23759593,22538991,22510764,21533138,19289445,20110278,19505943,18798982,12824373,16845041,12824340,16381832,21605702,22345618,23450794,19167326,20703300,21802130,22000014,22000016,22000013,23118739,18424795,18978789,20376054,23385723,8923859,11836331,12600935,9398852,11278460,12130543,23842462,23846593,21112873,22135294,18957444	http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21,http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21/,http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21,http://www.w3.org/,http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=bbbbbbbb	NULL	ALE-HSA21	http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21	NULL

Furthermore, integration of information such as agroecological farming system characteristics can provide new knowledge on risk factors of influenza emergence and spread. Integrating viral characteristics into an animal disease information system is therefore expected to provide a unique tool to trace-and-track particular virus strains; generate clade distributions and spatiotemporal clusters; screen for distribution of viruses with specific molecular markers; identify potential risk factors; and analyze or map viral characteristics related to vaccines used for control and/or prevention. For this purpose, a genetic module was developed within EMPRES-i (FAO’s global animal disease information system) linking epidemiological information from influenza events with virus characteristics and enabling combined analysis. An algorithm was developed to act as the interface between EMPRES-i disease event data and publicly available influenza virus sequences in OpenfluDB. This algorithm automatically computes potential links between outbreak event and sequences, which are subsequently manually validated by experts. Subsequently, other virus characteristics such as antiviral resistance can then be associated to outbreak data. To visualize such characteristics on a geographic map, shape files with virus characteristics to overlay on other EMPRES-i map layers (e.g. animal densities) can be generated. The genetic module allows export of associated epidemiological and sequence data for further analysis. FAO has made this tool available for scientists and policy makers.

Recent success on the first high-quality draft genome sequence of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) provides new insights on bamboo genetics and evolution. To further extend our understanding on bamboo genome and facilitate future studies on the basis of previous achievements, here we have developed BambooGDB, a bamboo genome database with functional annotation and analysis platform. Thede novosequencing data, together with the full-length complementary DNA and RNA-seq data of moso bamboo composed the main contents of this database. Based on these sequence data, a comprehensively functional annotation for bamboo genome was made. Besides, an analytical platform composed of comparative genomic analysis, protein–protein interactions network, pathway analysis and visualization of genomic data was also constructed. As discovery tools to understand and identify biological mechanisms of bamboo, the platform can be used as a systematic framework for helping and designing experiments for further validation. Moreover, diverse and powerful search tools and a convenient browser were incorporated to facilitate the navigation of these data. As far as we know, this is the first genome database for bamboo. Through integrating high-throughput sequencing data, a full functional annotation and several analysis modules, BambooGDB aims to provide worldwide researchers with a central genomic resource and an extensible analysis platform for bamboo genome.

Marques,Paulo C. Lana	NULL	Networks can greatly advance data sharing attitudes by providing organized and useful data sets on marine biodiversity in a friendly and shared scientific environment. NONATObase, the interactive database on polychaetes presented herein, will provide new macroecological and taxonomic insights of the Southwestern Atlantic region. The database was developed by the NONATO network, a team of South American researchers, who integrated available information on polychaetes from between 5°N and 80°S in the Atlantic Ocean and near the Antarctic. The guiding principle of the database is to keep free and open access to data based on partnerships. Its architecture consists of a relational database integrated in the MySQL and PHP framework. Its web application allows access to the data from three different directions: species (qualitative data), abundance (quantitative data) and data set (reference data). The database has built-in functionality, such as the filter of data on user-defined taxonomic levels, characteristics of site, sample, sampler, and mesh size used. Considering that there are still many taxonomic issues related to poorly known regional fauna, a scientific committee was created to work out consistent solutions to current misidentifications and equivocal taxonomy status of some species. Expertise from this committee will be incorporated by NONATObase continually. The use of quantitative data was possible by standardization of a sample unit. All data, maps of distribution and references from a data set or a specified query can be visualized and exported to a commonly used data format in statistical analysis or reference manager software. The NONATO network has initialized with NONATObase, a valuable resource for marine ecologists and taxonomists. The database is expected to grow in functionality as it comes in useful, particularly regarding the challenges of dealing with molecular genetic data and tools to assess the effects of global environment change.Database URL:http://nonatobase.ufsc.br/	2014-02-24	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000334511000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633768/NONATObase-a-database-for-Polychaeta-Annelida-from	10.1093/database/bau002	19741679,11009409	http://nonatobase.ufsc.br/,http://www.iobis.org,http://www.sealifebase.org,http://www.ala.org.au,http://www.fishbase.org,http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hexacoral,http://www.algaebase.org,http://www.webofknowledge.com,http://www.scopus.com,http://www.scielo.org,http://capesdw.capes.gov.br/,http://lattes.cnpq.br/,http://http:/nonatobase.ufsc.br,http://www.marinespecies.org/polychaeta	NULL	NULL	NONATObase	http://nonatobase.ufsc.br/	database

To facilitate global analyses of these interactions, we developed a web resource named ANIA:ANnotation andIntegratedAnalysis of the 14-3-3 interactome, which integrates multiple data sets on 14-3-3-binding phosphoproteins. ANIA also pinpoints candidate 14-3-3-binding phosphosites using predictor algorithms, assisted by our recent discovery that the human 14-3-3-interactome is highly enriched in 2R-ohnologues. 2R-ohnologues are proteins in families of two to four, generated by two rounds of whole genome duplication at the origin of the vertebrate animals. ANIA identifies candidate ‘lynchpins’, which are 14-3-3-binding phosphosites that are conserved across members of a given 2R-ohnologue protein family. Other features of ANIA include a link to the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer database to find cancer polymorphisms that map to 14-3-3-binding phosphosites, which would be expected to interfere with 14-3-3 interactions. We used ANIA to map known and candidate 14-3-3-binding enzymes within the 2R-ohnologue complement of the human kinome. Our projections indicate that 14-3-3s dock onto many more human kinases than has been realized. Guided by ANIA, PAK4, 6 and 7 (p21-activated kinases 4, 6 and 7) were experimentally validated as a 2R-ohnologue family of 14-3-3-binding phosphoproteins. PAK4 binding to 14-3-3 is stimulated by phorbol ester, and involves the ‘lynchpin’ site phosphoSer99 and a major contribution from Ser181. In contrast, PAK6 and PAK7 display strong phorbol ester-independent binding to 14-3-3, with Ser113 critical for the interaction with PAK6. These data point to differential 14-3-3 regulation of PAKs in control of cell morphology.Database URL:https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py	2014-02-05	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000331088900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2633758/ANIA-ANnotation-and-Integrated-Analysis-of-the-14	10.1093/database/bat085	22870394,21725060,23418452,21983031,20141511,11911880,19416966,9428519,12824383,21182200,20027184,19648646,20051463,23444366,23466027,21144020,23287633,22135298,21062810,23161681,21705381,21988835,17846036,23023983,15034147,10964570,19304878,19892828,20952405,20092628,19151095,12824398,20679480,23422566,19465394,12471243,23343193,23841590,22653441,19131956,19367708,23375375,22238634,19933840,21282462	https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py,https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py/download,http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/,https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py/download,https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py/kinome,https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py/kinome,https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py/kinome	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	ANIA	https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py	NULL

Tuberculosis is a disease with high morbidity and mortality, especially in the third world. The genetic variability between clinical isolates of MTBC has been poorly understood, although recent years have seen the re-sequencing of a large number of clinical isolates of MTBC from around the world. The availability of genomic data of multiple isolates in public domain would potentially offer a unique opportunity toward understanding the variome of the organism and the functional consequences of the variations. This nevertheless has been limited by the lack of systematic curation and analysis of data sets available in public domain. In this report, we have re-analyzed re-sequencing data sets corresponding to >450 isolates of MTBC available in public domain to create a comprehensive variome map of MTBC comprising >29 000 single nucleotide variations. Using a systematic computational pipeline, we have annotated potential functional variants and drug-resistance-associated variants from the variome. We have made available this data set as a searchable database.

Seebregts,Tulio de Oliveira	NULL	Substantial amounts of data have been generated from patient management and academic exercises designed to better understand the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and design interventions to control it. A number of specialized databases have been designed to manage huge data sets from HIV cohort, vaccine, host genomic and drug resistance studies. Besides databases from cohort studies, most of the online databases contain limited curated data and are thus sequence repositories. HIV drug resistance has been shown to have a great potential to derail the progress made thus far through antiretroviral therapy. Thus, a lot of resources have been invested in generating drug resistance data for patient management and surveillance purposes. Unfortunately, most of the data currently available relate to subtype B even though >60% of the epidemic is caused by HIV-1 subtype C. A consortium of clinicians, scientists, public health experts and policy markers working in southern Africa came together and formed a network, the Southern African Treatment and Resistance Network (SATuRN), with the aim of increasing curated HIV-1 subtype C and tuberculosis drug resistance data. This article describes the HIV-1 data curation process using the SATuRN Rega database. The data curation is a manual and time-consuming process done by clinical, laboratory and data curation specialists. Access to the highly curated data sets is through applications that are reviewed by the SATuRN executive committee. Examples of research outputs from the analysis of the curated data include trends in the level of transmitted drug resistance in South Africa, analysis of the levels of acquired resistance among patients failing therapy and factors associated with the absence of genotypic evidence of drug resistance among patients failing therapy. All these studies have been important for informing first- and second-line therapy.

The number of articles in PubMed has increased exponentially. Thus, the workload for biocurators has also increased exponentially. Under these circumstances, a system that can automatically determine in advance which article has a higher priority for curation can effectively reduce the workload of biocurators. Determining how to effectively find the articles required by biocurators has become an important task. In the triage task of BioCreative 2012, we proposed the Co-occurrence Interaction Nexus (CoIN) for learning and exploring relations in articles. We constructed a co-occurrence analysis system, which is applicable to PubMed articles and suitable for gene, chemical and disease queries. CoIN uses co-occurrence features and their network centralities to assess the influence of curatable articles from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The experimental results show that our network-based approach combined with co-occurrence features can effectively classify curatable and non-curatable articles. CoIN also allows biocurators to survey the ranking lists for specific queries without reviewing meaningless information. At BioCreative 2012, CoIN achieved a 0.778 mean average precision in the triage task, thus finishing in second place out of all participants.Database URL:http://ikmbio.csie.ncku.edu.tw/coin/home.php	2013-11-11	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000327012500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2871251/CoIN-a-network-analysis-for-document-triage	10.1093/database/bat076	22151252,18032438,12760826,22151968,16875881,12689350,21685059,21677032,15120654,8725772,22672646,22615549,11333967,17447836,21094696,23180769,11805826,16817963,21303863,22151999,18586726,23160415	http://ikmbio.csie.ncku.edu.tw/coin/home.php,http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/bc-workshop-2012/Triage/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	CoIN	http://ikmbio.csie.ncku.edu.tw/coin/home.php	NULL

These valuable data are scattered, and there have been no systematic attempts to document the various proteins regulated by hypoxia. Compilation, curation and annotation of these data are important in deciphering their role in hypoxia and hypoxia-related disorders. Therefore, we have compiled HypoxiaDB, a database of hypoxia-regulated proteins. It is a comprehensive, manually-curated, non-redundant catalog of proteins whose expressions are shown experimentally to be altered at different levels and durations of hypoxia. The database currently contains 72 000 manually curated entries taken on 3500 proteins extracted from 73 peer-reviewed publications selected from PubMed. HypoxiaDB is distinctive from other generalized databases: (i) it compiles tissue-specific protein expression changes under different levels and duration of hypoxia. Also, it provides manually curated literature references to support the inclusion of the protein in the database and establish its association with hypoxia. (ii) For each protein, HypoxiaDB integrates data on gene ontology, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway, protein–protein interactions, protein family (Pfam), OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), PDB (Protein Data Bank) structures and homology to other sequenced genomes. (iii) It also provides pre-compiled information on hypoxia-proteins, which otherwise requires tedious computational analysis. This includes information like chromosomal location, identifiers like Entrez, HGNC, Unigene, Uniprot, Ensembl, Vega, GI numbers and Genbank accession numbers associated with the protein. These are further cross-linked to respective public databases augmenting HypoxiaDB to the external repositories. (iv) In addition, HypoxiaDB provides an online sequence-similarity search tool for users to compare their protein sequences with HypoxiaDB protein database. We hope that HypoxiaDB will enrich our knowledge about hypoxia-related biology and eventually will lead to the development of novel hypothesis and advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic activities.

As these technologies become more popular, many research institutes have established core facilities of expertise to deal with the challenges of large-scale HTS experiments. As the efforts of core facility screening projects come to fruition, focus has shifted towards managing the results of these experiments and making them available in a useful format that can be further mined for phenotypic discovery. The HTS-DB database provides a public view of data from screening projects undertaken by the HTS core facility at the CRUK London Research Institute. All projects and screens are described with comprehensive assay protocols, and datasets are provided with complete descriptions of analysis techniques. This format allows users to browse and search data from large-scale studies in an informative and intuitive way. It also provides a repository for additional measurements obtained from screens that were not the focus of the project, such as cell viability, and groups these data so that it can provide a gene-centric summary across several different cell lines and conditions. All datasets from our screens that can be made available can be viewed interactively and mined for further hit lists. We believe that in this format, the database provides researchers with rapid access to results of large-scale experiments that might facilitate their understanding of genes/compounds identified in their own research.Database URL:http://hts.cancerresearchuk.org/db/public	2013-10-10	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbat072%2f2871247%2fHTS-DB-an-online-resource-to-publish-and-query	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/2871247/HTS-DB-an-online-resource-to-publish-and-query	10.1093/database/bat072	21527443,22298037,19644458,20625183,19261174,12045153,17828270,23203871,22939629	http://hts.cancerresearchuk.org/db/public,http://genomernai.de/GenomeRNAi/,http://rock.icr.ac.uk/,http://flight.icr.ac.uk/,http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,http://miare.sourceforge.net/HomePage,http://string-db.org/database,http://string-db.org/database	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	HTS-DB	http://hts.cancerresearchuk.org/db/public	NULL

Here we report the third release of the database (Phenol-Explorer 3.0), which adds data on the effects of food processing on polyphenol contents in foods. Data on >100 foods, covering 161 polyphenols or groups of polyphenols before and after processing, were collected from 129 peer-reviewed publications and entered into new tables linked to the existing relational design. The effect of processing on polyphenol content is expressed in the form of retention factor coefficients, or the proportion of a given polyphenol retained after processing, adjusted for change in water content. The result is the first database on the effects of food processing on polyphenol content and, following the model initially defined for Phenol-Explorer, all data may be traced back to original sources.

Gibson	NULL	The complex biological processes that control cellular function are mediated by intricate networks of molecular interactions. Accumulating evidence indicates that these interactions are often interdependent, thus acting cooperatively. Cooperative interactions are prevalent in and indispensible for reliable and robust control of cell regulation, as they underlie the conditional decision-making capability of large regulatory complexes. Despite an increased focus on experimental elucidation of the molecular details of cooperative binding events, as evidenced by their growing occurrence in literature, they are currently lacking from the main bioinformatics resources. One of the contributing factors to this deficiency is the lack of a computer-readable standard representation and exchange format for cooperative interaction data. To tackle this shortcoming, we added functionality to the widely used PSI-MI interchange format for molecular interaction data by defining new controlled vocabulary terms that allow annotation of different aspects of cooperativity without making structural changes to the underlying XML schema. As a result, we are able to capture cooperative interaction data in a structured format that is backward compatible with PSI-MI–based data and applications. This will facilitate the storage, exchange and analysis of cooperative interaction data, which in turn will advance experimental research on this fundamental principle in biology.Database URL:http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/	2013-09-24	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbat066%2f341677%2fCapturing-cooperative-interactions-with-the-PSI-MI	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/341677/Capturing-cooperative-interactions-with-the-PSI-MI	10.1093/database/bat066	12702867,20947012,22480932,19712106,19744855,20495562,18641616,19746372,19589184,15520792,19149897,15382234,17574024,18547802,19098893,22089251,17317137,21909575,3296191,18489257,22337053,20495563,21079590,21829382,18706817,22121220,14681454,22096227,21067998,10871269,16234320,14755292,17925023,19147664,23180781,21233089,17947979,19325550,21716279,18075577,18560010,127795,6455423,14343300,5938952,16906160,16423525,18353365,19841628,19359576,15919195,18422302,18422304,16629640,18498752,10932244,15741343,11023787,16209941,12050673,12004076,19217413,18833287,11805122,20818336,17687370,16707497,7630397,12081504,10559988,8756328,20460452,19834897,12611808,20829833,19225609,21051350,15264254	http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/,http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de,http://www.psidev.info/groups/molecular-interactions,http://www.psidev.info/groups/molecular-interactions,http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/,http://code.google.com/p/intact/wiki/Editor,http://www.psidev.info/mif#tools,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/validator/start.xhtml,http://switches.elm.eu.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	PSI-MI	http://psi-mi-cooperativeinteractions.embl.de/	NULL

Presently, approximately 80% of the pig proteome is still poorly annotated, and the existence of protein sequences is routinely inferred automatically by sequence alignment towards preexisting sequences. In this article, we introduce SUS-BAR, a database that derives information mainly from UniProt Knowledgebase and that includes 26 206 pig protein sequences. In SUS-BAR, 16 675 of the pig protein sequences are endowed with statistically validated functional and structural annotation. Our statistical validation is determined by adopting a cluster-centric annotation procedure that allows transfer of different types of annotation, including structure and function. Each sequence in the database can be associated with a set of statistically validated Gene Ontologies (GOs) of the three main sub-ontologies (Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component), with Pfam functional domains, and when possible, with a cluster Hidden Markov Model that allows modelling the 3D structure of the protein. A database search allows some statistics demonstrating the enrichment in both GO and Pfam annotations of the pig proteins as compared with UniProt Knowledgebase annotation. Searching in SUS-BAR allows retrieval of the pig protein annotation for further analysis. The search is also possible on the basis of specific GO terms and this allows retrieval of all the pig sequences participating into a given biological process, after annotation with our system. Alternatively, the search is possible on the basis of structural information, allowing retrieval of all the pig sequences with the same structural characteristics.Database URL:http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/	2013-09-21	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbat065%2f341505%2fSUS-BAR-a-database-of-pig-proteins-with	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/341505/SUS-BAR-a-database-of-pig-proteins-with	10.1093/database/bat065	21304247,20495211,20642822,23151582,19226439,15961444,3709526,10195279,12051862,14568541,12127456,17003074,19920124,10802651,21051339,19552451,21622657,23353650,23514411,21041441,20138069	http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/,http://piggenome.org,http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk,http://www.uniprot.org/help/biocuration,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/TrEMBLstats/,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig,http://www.ensembl.org,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/bar2.0,http://www.cnaf.infn.it/it/users/grid,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml,http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/download.htm,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/tutorial.htm,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig,http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/tutorial.htm,http://www.pymol.org,http://www.pymol.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	SUS-BAR	http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/pig/	database

John Wilbur	NULL	A vast amount of scientific information is encoded in natural language text, and the quantity of such text has become so great that it is no longer economically feasible to have a human as the first step in the search process. Natural language processing and text mining tools have become essential to facilitate the search for and extraction of information from text. This has led to vigorous research efforts to create useful tools and to create humanly labeled text corpora, which can be used to improve such tools. To encourage combining these efforts into larger, more powerful and more capable systems, a common interchange format to represent, store and exchange the data in a simple manner between different language processing systems and text mining tools is highly desirable. Here we propose a simple extensible mark-up language format to share text documents and annotations. The proposed annotation approach allows a large number of different annotations to be represented including sentences, tokens, parts of speech, named entities such as genes or diseases and relationships between named entities. In addition, we provide simple code to hold this data, read it from and write it back to extensible mark-up language files and perform some sample processing. We also describe completed as well as ongoing work to apply the approach in several directions.

Recent advances in studies on human intelligence have identified many new susceptibility genes. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in IQ score and the relationship between IQ score and the risk of mental disorders have won little attention. To address the genetic complexity of IQ score, we have developed IQdb (http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn), a publicly available database for exploring IQ-associated human genes. In total, we collected 158 experimental verified genes from literature as a core dataset in IQdb. In addition, 46 genomic regions related to IQ score have been curated from literature. Based on the core dataset and 46 confirmed linked genomic regions, more than 6932 potential IQ-related genes are expanded using data of protein–protein interactions. A systematic gene ranking approach was applied to all the collected and expanded genes to represent the relative importance of all the 7090 genes in IQdb. Our further systematic pathway analysis reveals that IQ-associated genes are significantly enriched in multiple signal events, especially related to cognitive systems. Of the 158 genes in the core dataset, 81 are involved in various psychotic and mental disorders. This comprehensive gene resource illustrates the importance of IQdb to our understanding on human intelligence, and highlights the utility of IQdb for elucidating the functions of IQ-associated genes and the cross-talk mechanisms among cognition-related pathways in some mental disorders for community.Database URL:http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn.	2013-09-11	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000324619900001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/341034/IQdb-an-intelligence-quotient-score-associated	10.1093/database/bat063	16260814,19047325,19294424,19430899,14717631,23155063,22139918,21071413,18988627,19602527,21097890,21447597,21045057,19826436,18978772,19261174,18516045,19289445,20436464,16246909,18077471,18832364,12952881,21067998,18981052,21143796,21253872,15118671,19880382,19594883,19478018,21115458,16381885,10498781,19536140,19033363,21812621	http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn,http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn,http://iqdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	IQdb	http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn	NULL

Groups allows Pathway Tools users to define a group of objects (e.g. groups of genes or metabolites) from a Pathway/Genome Database. Groups can be transformed (e.g. by transforming a metabolite group to the group of pathways in which those metabolites are substrates); combined through set operations; analysed (e.g. through enrichment analysis); and visualized (e.g. by painting onto a metabolic map diagram).

In a search for better prevention and treatment, there is ongoing research into the underlying molecular and genetic bases of these complex human diseases, as well as into the links with risk factors such as obesity. Although an increasing number of relevant genomic and proteomic data sets have become available, the quantity and diversity of the data make their efficient exploitation challenging. Here, we present metabolicMine, a data warehouse with a specific focus on the genomics, genetics and proteomics of common metabolic diseases. Developed in collaboration with leading UK metabolic disease groups, metabolicMine integrates data sets from a range of experiments and model organisms alongside tools for exploring them. The current version brings together information covering genes, proteins, orthologues, interactions, gene expression, pathways, ontologies, diseases, genome-wide association studies and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although the emphasis is on human data, key data sets from mouse and rat are included. These are complemented by interoperation with the RatMine rat genomics database, with a corresponding mouse version under development by the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) group. The web interface contains a number of features including keyword search, a library of Search Forms, the QueryBuilder and list analysis tools. This provides researchers with many different ways to analyse, view and flexibly export data. Programming interfaces and automatic code generation in several languages are supported, and many of the features of the web interface are available through web services. The combination of diverse data sets integrated with analysis tools and a powerful query system makes metabolicMine a valuable research resource. The web interface makes it accessible to first-time users, whereas the Application Programming Interface (API) and web services provide convenient data access and tools for bioinformaticians. metabolicMine is freely available online athttp://www.metabolicmine.orgDatabase URL:http://www.metabolicmine.org	2013-08-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000323104400002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/340254/metabolicMine-an-integrated-genomics-genetics-and	10.1093/database/bat060	19924209,21542944,19896746,17554300,21219419,22325160,14550629,19019817,21472891,18605991,23161693,19589147,21930506,16556315,23023984,20738864,21139605,21071405,19284314,21278374,22121220,23203989,17615057,22056736,21436302,19741700,19906737,15499007,22110037,23161678,21610748,22080510,15642094,17584797,20970519,19854951,23109552,21296746,21036866,22067452,23175610,23652793	http://www.metabolicmine.org,http://www.metabolicmine.org,http://www.intermine.org,http://www.intermine.org,http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/,http://ci.intermine.org/,http://www.ensembl.org,http://www.obofoundry.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene,http://www.geneontology.org,http://www.uniprot.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress,http://www.proteinatlas.org,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/variation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact,http://www.thebiogrid.org,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/funcgen,http://www.thebiogrid.org,http://www.reactome.org,http://www.rcsb.org,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim,http://www.ensembl.org,http://www.obofoundry.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene,http://www.geneontology.org,http://www.uniprot.org,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress,http://www.proteinatlas.org,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/variation,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact,http://www.thebiogrid.org,http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/funcgen,http://www.thebiogrid.org,http://www.reactome.org,http://www.rcsb.org,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim,http://ratmine.mcw.edu,http://www.postgresql.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	metabolicMine	http://www.metabolicmine.org	NULL

The challenge is to integrate this information with other publicly available data. Nucleotide sequencing throughput has been improved with new technologies; this increases the need for powerful information systems able to store, manage and explore data. GnpIS is a multispecies integrative information system dedicated to plant and fungi pests. It bridges genetic and genomic data, allowing researchers access to both genetic information (e.g. genetic maps, quantitative trait loci, markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms, germplasms and genotypes) and genomic data (e.g. genomic sequences, physical maps, genome annotation and expression data) for species of agronomical interest. GnpIS is used by both large international projects and plant science departments at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research.

Identification of these bivalent genes and understanding their functions are important for further research of lineage specification and embryo development. So far, lots of genome-wide histone modification data were generated in mouse and human ES cells. These valuable data make it possible to identify bivalent genes, but no comprehensive data repositories or analysis tools are available for bivalent genes currently. In this work, we develop BGDB, the database of bivalent genes. The database contains 6897 bivalent genes in human and mouse ES cells, which are manually collected from scientific literature.

Despite the advances in protein structure alignment algorithms, some of the local conformationally similar regions are mislabeled as structurally variable regions (SVRs). These regions are not well superimposed because of differences in their spatial orientations. The Database of Structural Alignments (DoSA) addresses this gap in identification of local structural similarities obscured in global protein structural alignments by realigning SVRs using an algorithm based on protein blocks. A set of protein blocks is a structural alphabet that abstracts protein structures into 16 unique local structural motifs. DoSA provides unique information about 159 780 conformationally similar and 56 140 conformationally dissimilar SVRs in 74 705 pairwise structural alignments of homologous proteins. The information provided on conformationally similar and dissimilar SVRs can be helpful to model loop regions. It is also conceivable that conformationally similar SVRs with conserved residues could potentially contribute toward functional integrity of homologues, and hence identifying such SVRs could be helpful in understanding the structural basis of protein function.Database URL:http://bo-protscience.fr/dosa/	2013-07-11	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbat048%2f336917%2fDoSA-Database-of-Structural-Alignments	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/336917/DoSA-Database-of-Structural-Alignments	10.1093/database/bat048	10329133,23197659,16650981,19756040,1560462,16780872,19333395,8819165,10980157,9796821,8743709,15941743,2181150,14534198,18193941,15072690,21445259,11025540,21731588,12784210,7984417,11125050,7723011,2156133,2107323,21569819,16736488	http://bo-protscience.fr/dosa/,http://www.jmol.org/,http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/,http://www.jmol.org/,http://bo-protscience.fr/dosa/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	DoSA	http://bo-protscience.fr/dosa/	NULL

However, efforts to integrate such data to obtain a global view of the molecular circuitry in m/hESCs are lagging behind. Here, we present an m/hESC-centered database called Embryonic Stem Cell Atlas from Pluripotency Evidence integrating data from many recent diverse high-throughput studies including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, genome-wide inhibitory RNA screens, gene expression microarrays or RNA-seq after knockdown (KD) or overexpression of critical factors, immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry proteomics and phosphoproteomics. The database provides web-based interactive search and visualization tools that can be used to build subnetworks and to identify known and novel regulatory interactions across various regulatory layers. The web-interface also includes tools to predict the effects of combinatorial KDs by additive effects controlled by sliders, or through simulation software implemented in MATLAB. Overall, the Embryonic Stem Cell Atlas from Pluripotency Evidence database is a comprehensive resource for the stem cell systems biology community.Database URL:http://www.maayanlab.net/ESCAPE	2013-06-21	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000320710000002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/336222/ESCAPE-database-for-integrating-high-content	10.1093/database/bat045	21179244,18724358,17204602,19727443,18453254,20574542,16978048,18769478,20890967,22807998,20656902,22034350,23586463,17916244,21063955,15642099,21881558,21176149,18358816,20505821,9636069,20581804,23271975,23180766	http://www.maayanlab.net/ESCAPE,http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=6&types=bbbbbbbb	NULL	ESCAPE	http://www.maayanlab.net/ESCAPE	database

Mathias,Jarrett Hines-Kay,Jeremy J. Yang,Gergely Zahoransky-Kohalmi,Cristian G. Bologa,Oleg Ursu,Tudor I. Oprea	NULL	Many bioactivity databases offer information regarding the biological activity of small molecules on protein targets. Information in these databases is often hard to resolve with certainty because of subsetting different data in a variety of formats; use of different bioactivity metrics; use of different identifiers for chemicals and proteins; and having to access different query interfaces, respectively. Given the multitude of data sources, interfaces and standards, it is challenging to gather relevant facts and make appropriate connections and decisions regarding chemical–protein associations. The CARLSBAD database has been developed as an integrated resource, focused on high-quality subsets from several bioactivity databases, which are aggregated and presented in a uniform manner, suitable for the study of the relationships between small molecules and targets. In contrast to data collection resources, CARLSBAD provides a single normalized activity value of a given type for each unique chemical–protein target pair. Two types of scaffold perception methods have been implemented and are available for datamining: HierS (hierarchical scaffolds) and MCES (maximum common edge subgraph). The 2012 release of CARLSBAD contains 439 985 unique chemical structures, mapped onto 1,420 889 unique bioactivities, and annotated with 277 140 HierS scaffolds and 54 135 MCES chemical patterns, respectively. Of the 890 323 unique structure–target pairs curated in CARLSBAD, 13.95% are aggregated from multiple structure–target values: 94 975 are aggregated from two bioactivities, 14 544 from three, 7 930 from four and 2214 have five bioactivities, respectively. CARLSBAD captures bioactivities and tags for 1435 unique chemical structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e. ‘drugs’). CARLSBAD processing resulted in a net 17.3% data reduction for chemicals, 34.3% reduction for bioactivities, 23% reduction for HierS and 25% reduction for MCES, respectively. The CARLSBAD database supports a knowledge mining system that provides non-specialists with novel integrative ways of exploring chemical biology space to facilitate knowledge mining in drug discovery and repurposing.Database URL:http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/.	2013-06-21	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000320710000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/336025/The-CARLSBAD-Database-A-Confederated-Database-of	10.1093/database/bat044	23185041,21948594,21087994,22145975,15857124,8709122,15921444,17309248,18956832,21446748,24900546,22102590,23087376,15542455,14597658	http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/,http://www.gnova.com/,http://www.eyesopen.com/,http://www.iuphar-db.org/,http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/indexR.html,http://code.google.com/p/unm-biocomp-hscaf/,http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/,http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandListForward,http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/,http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=8&types=bbbbtttt	NULL	CARLSBAD	http://carlsbad.health.unm.edu/carlsbad/	NULL

The French network counting the 16 licensed laboratories involved in Lynch syndrome genetic testing developed three locus-specific databases with the UMD® software (www.umd.be/MLH1/,www.umd.be/MSH2/andwww.umd.be/MSH6/) that presently contain a total of 7047 sequence variations including 707 distinct variations ofa prioriunknown functional significance (VUS) that were identified through complete mutation screening or targeted predictive testing. Mutation carriers are at high risk for developing early-onset colorectal and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Consensus clinical guidelines have been proposed, allowing the efficient detection of curable lesions. The major challenge of genetic testing is to reliably classify the genomic variations in those patients who seek genetic counseling. Combining the interactive tools of the software, the relevant published data and mainly original information produced by the French MisMatch Repair network, the UMD-MLH1/MSH2/MSH6 databases provide interpretation data for the 707 VUS that were classified according to the IARC 5-Class system.

Recent genome-wide studies have provided annotations of a large repertoire of various classes of noncoding transcripts. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) form a major proportion of these novel annotated noncoding transcripts, and presently known to be involved in a number of functionally distinct biological processes. Over 18 000 transcripts are presently annotated as lncRNA, and encompass previously annotated classes of noncoding transcripts including large intergenic noncoding RNA, antisense RNA and processed pseudogenes.

However, its productivity is challenged by various stresses, including drought and salinity. Transcription factors (TFs) represent a regulatory component of the genome and are the most important targets for engineering stress tolerance. Here, we constructed a database, RiceSRTFDB, which provides comprehensive expression information for rice TFs during drought and salinity stress conditions and various stages of development. This information will be useful to identify the target TF(s) involved in stress response at a particular stage of development. The curated information forcis-regulatory elements present in their promoters has also been provided, which will be important to study the binding proteins. In addition, we have provided the available mutants and their phenotype information for rice TFs. All these information have been integrated in the database to facilitate the selection of target TFs of interest for functional analysis. This database aims to accelerate functional genomics research of rice TFs and understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying abiotic stress responses.Database URL:http://www.nipgr.res.in/RiceSRTFDB.html	2013-05-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000318597600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/333478/RiceSRTFDB-A-database-of-rice-transcription	10.1093/database/bat027	20409277,21132431,14645724,16217609,17225073,20821243,19126699,20047852,20507936,21476089,17597893,19841686,21965557,17180734,20208064,21186175,21216747,16551659,19858103,17145706,23299411,16275051,17293439,19706179,20924028,21406116,18430022,19490115,20600702,11910004,12897251,19820190,20525005,20015061	http://www.nipgr.res.in/RiceSRTFDB.html,http://agri-trait.dna.affrc.go.jp/,http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/OryzaExpress/,http://tos.nias.affrc.go.jp/,http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/,http://drtf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/,http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/,http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/,http://tos.nias.affrc.go.jp/,http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/index.html	NULL	NULL	RiceSRTFDB	http://www.nipgr.res.in/RiceSRTFDB.html	database

Recent advances in genomic technologies allow for rapid generation of models with a range of targeted genotypes as well as their characterization by high-throughput phenotyping. As an abundance of phenotype data become available, only systematic analysis will facilitate valid conclusions to be drawn from these data and transferred to human diseases. Owing to the volume of data, automated methods are preferable, allowing for a reliable analysis of the data and providing evidence about possible gene–disease associations.Here, we propose Phenotype comparisons for DIsease Genes and Models (PhenoDigm), as an automated method to provide evidence about gene–disease associations by analysing phenotype information. PhenoDigm integrates data from a variety of model organisms and, at the same time, uses several intermediate scoring methods to identify only strongly data-supported gene candidates for human genetic diseases. We show results of an automated evaluation as well as selected manually assessed examples that support the validity of PhenoDigm. Furthermore, we provide guidance on how to browse the data with PhenoDigm’s web interface and illustrate its usefulness in supporting research.Database URL:http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm	2013-05-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000318597300001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/333089/PhenoDigm-analyzing-curated-annotations-to	10.1093/database/bat025	21520331,17762889,21677750,23175610,22940749,22961258,19933761,20064205,12717820,18950739,20052305,22961259,21261995,19956802,22331800,23047555,18508807,18371930,17478516,19649320,21737429,21343142,14681409,20442139,23074187,17989687,18460186,22560091,21237142,7531539,7512862,7711723,15218257,18423521	http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/zmp/,http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org/,http://www.owlsim.org,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm,http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/∼bioiuser/gpp/,http://mousemodels.org,http://phenomebrowser.net/,http://omim.org/,http://human.phenotype.org/,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouse/mouseportal/,http://http://www.informatics.jax.org/,http://zfin.org/,http://obofoundry.org/,http://omim.org/downloads,http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/∼bioiuser/gpp/tools.php?toolid=21,http://owlsim.org,http://www.perl.org/,http://www.mysql.com/,http://code.google.com/p/phenodigm,http://www.playframework.org/,http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/,http://www.europhenome.org/biomart/martview,http://www.informatics.jax.org/accession/MGI:3839444,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/search?query=Krt76	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=7&types=tttttttt	NULL	PhenoDigm	http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm	NULL

It is a slow, error-prone, complex, costly and, yet, highly important task. Previous experiences have proven that text mining can assist in its many phases, especially, in triage of relevant documents and extraction of named entities and biological events. Here, we present the curation pipeline of the CellFinder database, a repository of cell research, which includes data derived from literature curation and microarrays to identify cell types, cell lines, organs and so forth, and especially patterns in gene expression. The curation pipeline is based on freely available tools in all text mining steps, as well as the manual validation of extracted data. Preliminary results are presented for a data set of 2376 full texts from which >4500 gene expression events in cell or anatomical part have been extracted. Validation of half of this data resulted in a precision of ∼50% of the extracted data, which indicates that we are on the right track with our pipeline for the proposed task. However, evaluation of the methods shows that there is still room for improvement in the named-entity recognition and that a larger and more robust corpus is needed to achieve a better performance for event extraction.Database URL:http://www.cellfinder.org/	2013-04-18	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbat020%2f332343%2fPreliminary-evaluation-of-the-CellFinder	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/332343/Preliminary-evaluation-of-the-CellFinder	10.1093/database/bat020	20221640,19814812,17646325,18834493,18834494,20617200,22759455,22711795,19393341,22789588,15383839,15719064,18271954,12689350,17655769,14681407,19884130,15814565,18492243,20959347,19587356,18237434,15860559,18689813,20149233,19429696,15693950,22973865,20200009,19920128,22293552,20442139,18426551,22759458,19232400,21303863,22859502	http://www.cellfinder.org/,http://www.cellfinder.org/,http://cellfinder.org/about/ontology,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/,http://opennlp.apache.org/,https://github.com/dmcc/bllip-parserV,http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml,http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/CSP/,https://github.com/jbjorne/TEES/wiki/TEES-Overview,http://cellfinder.org/about/annotation/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	CellFinder	http://www.cellfinder.org/	NULL

Paul Morrey,Marilyn Safran,Doron Lancet	NULL	Comprehensive disease classification, integration and annotation are crucial for biomedical discovery. At present, disease compilation is incomplete, heterogeneous and often lacking systematic inquiry mechanisms. We introduce MalaCards, an integrated database of human maladies and their annotations, modeled on the architecture and strategy of the GeneCards database of human genes. MalaCards mines and merges 44 data sources to generate a computerized card for each of 16 919 human diseases. Each MalaCard contains disease-specific prioritized annotations, as well as inter-disease connections, empowered by the GeneCards relational database, its searches and GeneDecks set analyses. First, we generate a disease list from 15 ranked sources, using disease-name unification heuristics. Next, we use four schemes to populate MalaCards sections: (i) directly interrogating disease resources, to establish integrated disease names, synonyms, summaries, drugs/therapeutics, clinical features, genetic tests and anatomical context; (ii) searching GeneCards for related publications, and for associated genes with corresponding relevance scores; (iii) analyzing disease-associated gene sets in GeneDecks to yield affiliated pathways, phenotypes, compounds and GO terms, sorted by a composite relevance score and presented with GeneCards links; and (iv) searching within MalaCards itself, e.g. for additional related diseases and anatomical context. The latter forms the basis for the construction of a disease network, based on shared MalaCards annotations, embodying associations based on etiology, clinical features and clinical conditions. This broadly disposed network has a power-law degree distribution, suggesting that this might be an inherent property of such networks. Work in progress includes hierarchical malady classification, ontological mapping and disease set analyses, striving to make MalaCards an even more effective tool for biomedical research.Database URL:http://www.malacards.org/	2013-04-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000317463800002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/331798/MalaCards-an-integrated-compendium-for-diseases	10.1093/database/bat018	15716906,21472891,23093600,22080554,16888670,8412823,16770974,20001862,20442139,17278118,17396438,11810281,23172862,18950739,23193271,21164525,18923704,21695124,19269289,19357641,23176824,20562859	http://www.malacards.org/,http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary,http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary,http://infectiousdiseaseontology.org/page/Main_Page,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/,http://www.genecards.org/index.php?path=/HTML/page/searchHelp#relevance,http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/,http://lucene.apache.org/solr/,http://www.malacards.org/pages/searchguide,http://lucene.apache.org,http://www.mysql.org,http://lucene.apache.org/,http://lucene.apache.org/solr/,https://gephi.org/toolkit/,http://www.bugzilla.org/,http://www.malacards.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	MalaCards	http://www.malacards.org/	NULL

Biological information curated for these data objects includes disease associations, phenotypes, pathways, molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. Recently, a project was initiated at RGD to incorporate quantitative phenotype data for rat strains, in addition to the currently existing qualitative phenotype data for rat strains, QTLs and genes. A specialized curation tool was designed to generate manual annotations with up to six different ontologies/vocabularies used simultaneously to describe a single experimental value from the literature.

Fouad Bouzidi,Marie Agier,Pierre Martre	NULL	The functional annotation of genes based on sequence homology with genes from model species genomes is time-consuming because it is necessary to mine several unrelated databases. The aim of the present work was to develop a functional annotation database for common wheatTriticum aestivum(L.). The database, named dbWFA, is based on the reference NCBI UniGene set, an expressed gene catalogue built by expressed sequence tag clustering, and on full-length coding sequences retrieved from the TriFLDB database. Information from good-quality heterogeneous sources, including annotations for model plant speciesArabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. andOryza sativaL., was gathered and linked toT. aestivumsequences through BLAST-based homology searches. Even though the complexity of the transcriptome cannot yet be fully appreciated, we developed a tool to easily and promptly obtain information from multiple functional annotation systems (Gene Ontology, MapMan bin codes, MIPS Functional Categories, PlantCyc pathway reactions and TAIR gene families). The use of dbWFA is illustrated here with several query examples. We were able to assign a putative function to 45% of the UniGenes and 81% of the full-length coding sequences from TriFLDB. Moreover, comparison of the annotation of the wholeT. aestivumUniGene set along with curated annotations of the two model species assessed the accuracy of the annotation provided by dbWFA. To further illustrate the use of dbWFA, genes specifically expressed during the early cell division or late storage polymer accumulation phases ofT. aestivumgrain development were identified using a clustering analysis and then annotated using dbWFA. The annotation of these two sets of genes was consistent with previous analyses ofT. aestivumgrain transcriptomes and proteomes.Database URL:urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dbWFA/	2013-05-09	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000318597000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/331156/dbWFA-a-web-based-database-for-functional	10.1093/database/bat014	21081278,22645563,23192148,18325108,22123899,16533819,15514037,15447653,15341637,22943283,22009731,14681433,23161406,18287692,19545381,19448038,22334568,11130711,11935017,16100779,19965430,20075913,19189423,20148030,23075845,22198273,21822265,16081474,22140109,17145706,9254694,20298594,22416807,22034626,20522724,14996223,15486203,12519987,15012246,15247400,18162592,22672222,16006577,17211515,20641138,22394196,11301307,16771774,11793221,20573045,20439314,18697771	http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dbWFA/,http://faostat.fao.org,http://avena.pw.usda.gov/genome/,http://www.triticeaegenome.eu,http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/,http://harvest.ucr.edu/,http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/genome/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene,http://www.geneontology.org,http://www.plantcyc.org,http://mapman.gabipd.org,http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/en/mips/projects/funcat,http://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/genefamily,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	dbWFA	http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dbWFA/	database

This resource provides uniformly prepared microarray data for 2970 patients from 23 studies with curated and documented clinical metadata. It allows users to efficiently identify studies and patient subgroups of interest for analysis and to perform meta-analysis immediately without the challenges posed by harmonizing heterogeneous microarray technologies, study designs, expression data processing methods and clinical data formats. We confirm that the recently proposed biomarkerCXCL12is associated with patient survival, independently of stage and optimal surgical debulking, which was possible only through meta-analysis owing to insufficient sample sizes of the individual studies.

Harrow	NULL	Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes play a critical role in vertebrate immune response and because the MHC is linked to a significant number of auto-immune and other diseases it is of great medical interest. Here we describe the clone-based sequencing and subsequent annotation of the MHC region of the gorilla genome. Because the MHC is subject to extensive variation, both structural and sequence-wise, it is not readily amenable to study in whole genome shotgun sequence such as the recently published gorilla genome. The variation of the MHC also makes it of evolutionary interest and therefore we analyse the sequence in the context of human and chimpanzee. In our comparisons with human and re-annotated chimpanzee MHC sequence we find that gorilla has a trimodular RCCX cluster, versus the reference human bimodular cluster, and additional copies of Class I (pseudo)genes betweenGogo-KandGogo-A(the orthologues ofHLA-Kand-A). We also find thatGogo-H(andPatr-H) is coding versus theHLA-Hpseudogene and, conversely, there is aGogo-DQB2pseudogene versus theHLA-DQB2coding gene. Our analysis, which is freely available through the VEGA genome browser, provides the research community with a comprehensive dataset for comparative and evolutionary research of the MHC.	2013-04-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000317463000001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/330685/Sequencing-and-comparative-analysis-of-the-gorilla	10.1093/database/bat011	12445322,14574404,18193213,16440057,17554300,15573121,11782246,16136131,16702430,17319744,7063861,11528119,22398555,18003653,14737185,18989455,10866107,1744581,9866194,10663565,15269276,10368437,11564803,15289473,11079097,10081226,15758205,12493009,9321430,8781120,10369920,11034563,9480751,12743023,19127303,1464555,1587552,8340229,22526602,9733642,17345114,9675159,11252172,11120825,8661725,10871871,11367523,1681597,16728259,7797267,9066271,8797733,8514140,10859342,1618655,1729169,11487475,12224044,10343159,15530841,19135723,10207042,23099234,23122694,16094301,22897909,17675392,21854592,16515853,15607421,15140828,15123589,9862982,9283765,9149143	http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Gorilla_gorilla/Location/Chromosome?r=6-MHC,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/stats.html,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/nhp/index.html,http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Pan_troglodytes/Info/Index,http://www.lpzoo.com/,http://bacpac.chori.org/library.php?id=127,http://www.repeatmasker.org,http://blast.advbiocomp.com/,http://doc.bioperl.org/bioperl-live/Bio/Tools/Fgenesh.html,http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/vertebrategenome/havana/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	MHC	http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Gorilla_gorilla/Location/Chromosome?r=6-MHC	NULL

Guo,Kun Sun,Xiaoxi Su,Huating Wang,Hao Sun	NULL	Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, plays a critical role in regulating cell development, differentiation, cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Previous studies identified many YY1-regulated target genes in both human and mouse. Emerging global mapping by Chromatin ImmnoPrecipitation (ChIP)-based high-throughput experiments indicate that YY1 binds to a vast number of loci genome-wide. However, the information is widely scattered in many disparate poorly cross-indexed literatures; a large portion was only published recently by the ENCODE consortium with limited annotation. A centralized database, which annotates and organizes YY1-binding loci and target motifs in a systematic way with easy access, will be valuable resources for the research community. We therefore implemented a web-based YY1 Target loci Database (YY1TargetDB). This database contains YY1-binding loci (binding peaks) from ChIP-seq and ChIP-on-chip experiments, computationally predicated YY1 and cofactor motifs within each locus. It also collects the experimentally verified YY1-binding motifs from individual researchers. The current version of YY1TargetDB contains 92 314 binding loci identified by ChIP-based experiments; 157 200 YY1-binding motifs in which 42 are experimentally verified and 157 158 are computationally predicted; and 130 759 binding motifs for 47 cofactors.Database URL:http://www.myogenesisdb.org/YY1TargetDB	2013-02-14	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316179400002&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/330343/YY1TargetDB-an-integral-information-resource-for	10.1093/database/bat007	16314846,9141463,18977326,17438126,22319554,22438993,9662337,21173166,22570637,21170310,22210892,20145141,22075998,22955616,19497933,17241466,21775309,21912677,19797408,19773424,22121212,20959295,8524292,12411495	http://www.myogenesisdb.org/YY1TargetDB,http://www.myogenesisdb.org/YY1TargetDB,http://www.myogenesisdb.org/YY1TargetDB	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	YY1TargetDB	http://www.myogenesisdb.org/YY1TargetDB	NULL

The TIARA genome browser is a powerful tool for the analysis of personal genomic information by exploring genomic variants such as SNPs, indels and structural variants simultaneously. As of September 2012, the TIARA database provides raw data and variant information for 13 sequenced whole genomes, 16 sequenced transcriptomes and 33 high resolution array assays. Sequencing reads are available at a depth of ∼30× for whole genomes and 50× for transcriptomes. Information on genomic variants includes a total of ∼9.56 million SNPs, 23 025 of which are non-synonymous SNPs, and ∼1.19 million indels. In this update, by adding high coverage sequencing of additional human individuals, the TIARA genome database now provides an extensive record of rare variants in humans. Following TIARA’s fundamentally integrative approach, new transcriptome sequencing data are matched with whole-genome sequencing data in the genome browser.

In flies and mice, the pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that regulate protein-coding genes through the RNAi pathway. Following these findings, we construct an innovative and comprehensive database to elucidate siRNA-mediated mechanism in human transcribed pseudogenes (TPGs). To investigate TPG producing siRNAs that regulate protein-coding genes, we mapped the TPGs to small RNAs (sRNAs) that were supported by publicly deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries and constructed the TPG-derived siRNA-target interactions. In addition, we also presented that TPGs can act as a target for miRNAs that actually regulate the parental gene. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of these results and additional information, we have developed a database, pseudoMap, capturing various types of information, including sequence data, TPG and cognate annotation, deep sequencing data, RNA-folding structure, gene expression profiles, miRNA annotation and target prediction. As our knowledge, pseudoMap is the first database to demonstrate two mechanisms of human TPGs: encoding siRNAs and decoying miRNAs that target the parental gene. pseudoMap is freely accessible athttp://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.Database URL:http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/	2013-02-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316179100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/329654/pseudoMap-an-innovative-and-comprehensive-resource	10.1093/database/bat001	10692568,14656963,19123937,17937804,15860774,15103394,19754956,15876366,17568002,19641029,12140234,10479675,12721631,20577206,21441351,17304245,18463631,18403677,18463636,18463630,18404147,18404146,22086963,18948287,16141072,21037258,17991681,18000000,15608160,17145715,16381836,18285502,19056940,17967047,21316602,12045153,12824337,18029362,18955434,17612493,15652477,15502875,16845047,16939800,16572319,18636107,2231712,22155609,17099229,15608268,18597685,16671097	http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://www.ensembl.org/index.html,http://www.mysql.com/,http://www.apache.org/,http://www.php.net/,http://www.linux.com,http://www.smarty.net,http://www.javascriptsource.com/,http://www.w3schools.com/css/,http://www.w3schools.com/html/,http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://www.pseudogene.org/,https://genome.uiowa.edu/pseudogenes/,http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/hoppsigen.html,http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,http://www.pseudogene.org/,https://genome.uiowa.edu/pseudogenes/,http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/hoppsigen.html,http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	pseudoMap	http://pseudomap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/	NULL

The Text-mined Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes candidate gene database (T-HOD) is developed to help trace existing research on three kinds of cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, obesity and diabetes, with the last disease categorized into Type 1 and Type 2, by regularly and semiautomatically extracting HOD-related genes from newly published literature. Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease–gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein–protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts. The interface of T-HOD facilitates easy browsing for users and allows T-HOD curators to verify data efficiently. We believe that T-HOD can help life scientists in search for more disease candidate genes in a less time- and effort-consuming manner.Database URL:http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/THOD	2013-02-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316179500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/329321/T-HOD-a-literature-based-candidate-gene-database	10.1093/database/bas061	11882567,18499899,18657591,17169983,18605991,15118671,17932060,17625544,18854039,16551372,22168213,21685052,20479501,19958519	http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/THOD,http://www.hprd.org/,http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw:8080/THOD/request_sentence_list,http://alias-i.com/lingpipe	NULL	NULL	T-HOD	http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/THOD	database

In this study, we develop a new module called ‘correlation module’, which includes three kinds of gene expression correlation analyses. The first one computes correlation coefficient between 2 or more (up to 10) chosen genes. The second one produces two lists of genes that are most correlated (positively and negatively) to a ‘tested’ gene. A gene ontology (GO) mining function is also proposed to explore GO ‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’ terms enrichment for the output lists of most correlated genes. The third one explores gene expression correlation between the 15 telomeric and 15 centromeric genes surrounding a ‘tested’ gene. These correlation analyses can be performed in different groups of patients: all patients (without any subtyping), in molecular subtypes (basal-like, HER2+, luminal A and luminal B) and according to oestrogen receptor status. Validation tests based on published data showed that these automatized analyses lead to results consistent with studies’ conclusions. In brief, this new module has been developed to help basic researchers explore molecular mechanisms of breast cancer.Database URL:http://bcgenex.centregauducheau.fr	2013-01-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316178300001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/329170/bc-GenExMiner-3-0-new-mining-module-computes	10.1093/database/bas060	21452023,10802651,21633166,15574760,16897746,17157792,18662380,19020972,19513072,15149721,20825665,21898387,17599933,18757432,19147748,19372580,17133270,18314908,20068109,12414653	http://bcgenex.centregauducheau.fr,http://bcgenex.centregauducheau.fr,http://www.ensembl.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=unigene	NULL	NULL	bc-GenExMiner 3.0	http://bcgenex.centregauducheau.fr	NULL

To account for the heterogeneity of these data, we introduced in version 6.0, a two-tier rating system for the strength of evidence, classifying evidence as either ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ (Gama-Castro,S.,Jimenez-Jacinto,V., Peralta-Gil,M.et al.RegulonDB (Version 6.0): gene regulation model ofEscherichia ColiK-12 beyond transcription, active (experimental) annotated promoters and textpresso navigation.Nucleic Acids Res., 2008;36:D120–D124.). We now add to our classification scheme the classification of high-throughput evidence, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RNA-seq technologies. To integrate these data into RegulonDB, we present two strategies for the evaluation of confidence, statistical validation and independent cross-validation. Statistical validation involves verification of ChIP data for transcription factor-binding sites, using tools for motif discovery and quality assessment of the discovered matrices. Independent cross-validation combines independent evidence with the intention to mutually exclude false positives. Both statistical validation and cross-validation allow to upgrade subsets of data that are supported by weak evidence to a higher confidence level. Likewise, cross-validation of strong confidence data extends our two-tier rating system to a three-tier system by introducing a third confidence score ‘confirmed’.Database URL:http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/	2013-01-17	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316174600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/328558/Evidence-classification-of-high-throughput	10.1093/database/bas059	21051347,21097882,22139911,22102575,22121220,22096227,18158297,19304856,19609351,20164839,19923228,20190049,21962126,21816880,21460078,20625424,20888288,20711195,19735299,19015660,21074401,16381895,20852648,12566399,21266481,22067484,18660515,21889483,20838408,17897965,17698025,11196314,22383849,19758836,16436800,19881496,19838305,22163312,7505337,8995304,22015844,12202758,17652327,12087173,17598888,22096236,20395217,19371405,21252076,18516045,17565680,18638416,17623705,21572102,22180530,17449618,12366850,18948201,21398637,15520470,14986705,17981601,19026863,17581117,18765474,19736561,21646344,20602746,17406458,21115656,22242135,21938619,2172928,10812473,15720719,16855295,15637633,20923783,23203884,22334569,22156162,18215291,21715389,14741201,3058703,8388874,2113912,8757744,1490614,8106311,1729205,1429435,2198266,22152010,2404765,2211510,1971620,1971621,8104841	http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/,http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/evidenceClassification.jsp,http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/	NULL	NULL	RegulonDB	http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/	NULL

As the volume of biological literature increases, the use of text mining to assist in biocuration becomes increasingly relevant. A number of groups have developed tools for text mining from a computer science/linguistics perspective, and there are many initiatives to curate some aspect of biology from the literature. Some biocuration efforts already make use of a text mining tool, but there have not been many broad-based systematic efforts to study which aspects of a text mining tool contribute to its usefulness for a curation task. Here, we report on an effort to bring together text mining tool developers and database biocurators to test the utility and usability of tools. Six text mining systems presenting diverse biocuration tasks participated in a formal evaluation, and appropriate biocurators were recruited for testing. The performance results from this evaluation indicate that some of the systems were able to improve efficiency of curation by speeding up the curation task significantly (∼1.7- to 2.5-fold) over manual curation. In addition, some of the systems were able to improve annotation accuracy when compared with the performance on the manually curated set. In terms of inter-annotator agreement, the factors that contributed to significant differences for some of the systems included the expertise of the biocurator on the given curation task, the inherent difficulty of the curation and attention to annotation guidelines. After the task, annotators were asked to complete a survey to help identify strengths and weaknesses of the various systems. The analysis of this survey highlights how important task completion is to the biocurators’ overall experience of a system, regardless of the system’s high score on design, learnability and usability. In addition, strategies to refine the annotation guidelines and systems documentation, to adapt the tools to the needs and query types the end user might have and to evaluate performance in terms of efficiency, user interface, result export and traditional evaluation metrics have been analyzed during this task. This analysis will help to plan for a more intense study in BioCreative IV.	2013-01-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316175600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/328136/An-overview-of-the-BioCreative-2012-Workshop-Track	10.1093/database/bas056	15960821,18834487,20704011,22151647,22151968,19622167,20463926,21303863,22679507,20696046,15814565,21685052,19958519,22541592	http://www.biocreative.org/,http://www.biocreative.org/about/biocreative-iii/UAG/,http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/bc-workshop-2012/track-iii-systems,http://ir.cis.udel.edu/biocreative/survey.html,http://ir.cis.udel.edu/biocreative/survey.html	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/	NULL

Despite the continuing advances in biomedical text mining and the pressing needs of biocurators for better tools, few existing text-mining tools have been successfully integrated into production literature curation systems such as those used by the expert curated databases. To close this gap and better understand all aspects of literature curation, we invited submissions of written descriptions of curation workflows from expert curated databases for the BioCreative 2012 Workshop Track II. We received seven qualified contributions, primarily from model organism databases. Based on these descriptions, we identified commonalities and differences across the workflows, the common ontologies and controlled vocabularies used and the current and desired uses of text mining for biocuration. Compared to a survey done in 2009, our 2012 results show that many more databases are now using text mining in parts of their curation workflows. In addition, the workshop participants identified text-mining aids for finding gene names and symbols (gene indexing), prioritization of documents for curation (document triage) and ontology concept assignment as those most desired by the biocurators.Database URL:http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/bc-workshop-2012/workflow/	2012-11-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316113100005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/439202/Biocuration-workflows-and-text-mining-overview-of	10.1093/database/bas043	22151647,15960821,20704011,18834487,15960832,18834493,15960823,18834494,22151901,15960828,22151929,18834495,19814812,10802651,15383839,19622167,18271954,12689350,17655769,21094696,22151968	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/bc-workshop-2012/workflow/,http://www.biocreative.org/,http://gmod.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=10&types=bbbttttt	NULL	BioCreative	http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/bc-workshop-2012/workflow/	NULL

Tudor,Cecilia N. Arighi,Qinghua Wang,Cathy H. Wu,K. Vijay-Shanker	NULL	Protein phosphorylation is a central regulatory mechanism in signal transduction involved in most biological processes. Phosphorylation of a protein may lead to activation or repression of its activity, alternative subcellular location and interaction with different binding partners. Extracting this type of information from scientific literature is critical for connecting phosphorylated proteins with kinases and interaction partners, along with their functional outcomes, for knowledge discovery from phosphorylation protein networks. We have developed the Extracting Functional Impact of Phosphorylation (eFIP) text mining system, which combines several natural language processing techniques to find relevant abstracts mentioning phosphorylation of a given protein together with indications of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and potential evidences for impact of phosphorylation on the PPIs. eFIP integrates our previously developed tools, Extracting Gene Related ABstracts (eGRAB) for document retrieval and name disambiguation, Rule-based LIterature Mining System (RLIMS-P) for Protein Phosphorylation for extraction of phosphorylation information, a PPI module to detect PPIs involving phosphorylated proteins and an impact module for relation extraction. The text mining system has been integrated into the curation workflow of the Protein Ontology (PRO) to capture knowledge about phosphorylated proteins. The eFIP web interface accepts gene/protein names or identifiers, or PubMed identifiers as input, and displays results as a ranked list of abstracts with sentence evidence and summary table, which can be exported in a spreadsheet upon result validation. As a participant in the BioCreative-2012 Interactive Text Mining track, the performance of eFIP was evaluated on document retrieval (F-measures of 78–100%), sentence-level information extraction (F-measures of 70–80%) and document ranking (normalized discounted cumulative gain measures of 93–100% and mean average precision of 0.86). The utility and usability of the eFIP web interface were also evaluated during the BioCreative Workshop. The use of the eFIP interface provided a significant speed-up (∼2.5-fold) for time to completion of the curation task. Additionally, eFIP significantly simplifies the task of finding relevant articles on PPI involving phosphorylated forms of a given protein.Database URL:http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/iprolink/eFIP.shtml	2012-12-05	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316115500001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/439531/The-eFIP-system-for-text-mining-of-protein	10.1093/database/bas044	21082428,20935045,20696046,15333458,16899134,17314123,15958172,16037121,15814565,15961474,21576755,22759456,20671316,18508809,20183879,19074302,884196	http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/iprolink/eFIP.shtml,http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/iprolink/rlimsp.shtml,http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/iprolink/eFIPCorpus.txt	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	eFIP	http://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/iprolink/eFIP.shtml	NULL

As the volume of biological literature grows rapidly, it becomes increasingly difficult for biocurators to keep up with the literature because manual curation is an expensive and time-consuming endeavour. Past research has suggested that computer-assisted curation can improve efficiency, but few text-mining systems have been formally evaluated in this regard. Through participation in the interactive text-mining track of the BioCreative 2012 workshop, we developed PubTator, a PubMed-like system that assists with two specific human curation tasks: document triage and bioconcept annotation. On the basis of evaluation results from two external user groups, we find that the accuracy of PubTator-assisted curation is comparable with that of manual curation and that PubTator can significantly increase human curatorial speed.

Genetic literature curation focuses on the extraction of genetic entities (e.g. genes, mutant alleles, transgenic constructs) and their associated phenotypes and Gene Ontology terms from the published literature. Over 2000 Drosophila research articles are now published every year. These articles are becoming ever more data-rich and there is a growing need for text mining to shoulder some of the burden of paper triage and data extraction. In this article, we describe our curation workflow, along with some of the problems and bottlenecks therein, and highlight the opportunities for text mining.

Tudor,Carl J. Schmidt,K. Vijay-Shanker,Fiona M. McCarthy	NULL	AgBase provides annotation for agricultural gene products using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Plant Ontology, as appropriate. Unlike model organism species, agricultural species have a body of literature that does not just focus on gene function; to improve efficiency, we use text mining to identify literature for curation. The first component of our annotation interface is the gene prioritization interface that ranks gene products for annotation. Biocurators select the top-ranked gene and mark annotation for these genes as ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’; links enable biocurators to move directly to our biocuration interface (BI). Our BI includes all current GO annotation for gene products and is the main interface to add/modify AgBase curation data. The BI also displays Extracting Genic Information from Text (eGIFT) results for each gene product. eGIFT is a web-based, text-mining tool that associates ranked, informative terms (iTerms) and the articles and sentences containing them, with genes. Moreover, iTerms are linked to GO terms, where they match either a GO term name or a synonym. This enables AgBase biocurators to rapidly identify literature for further curation based on possible GO terms. Because most agricultural species do not have standardized literature, eGIFT searches all gene names and synonyms to associate articles with genes. As many of the gene names can be ambiguous, eGIFT applies a disambiguation step to remove matches that do not correspond to this gene, and filtering is applied to remove abstracts that mention a gene in passing. The BI is linked to our Journal Database (JDB) where corresponding journal citations are stored. Just as importantly, biocurators also add to the JDB citations that have no GO annotation. The AgBase BI also supports bulk annotation upload to facilitate our Inferred from electronic annotation of agricultural gene products. All annotations must pass standard GO Consortium quality checking before release in AgBase.Database URL:http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/	2012-11-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316113100001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/438145/Developing-a-biocuration-workflow-for-AgBase-a-non	10.1093/database/bas038	21075795,18629207,20696046,22577759,12775220	http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/uniprot_release.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=4&types=tttttwww	NULL	AgBase	http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/	database

In order to carry this out, among other work, a database—the eTDB—was developed. In addition to complex permission rules and software and management quality control (QC), it was necessary to develop anonymization, processing and data visualization tools for the data uploaded. It was also necessary to develop sophisticated curation strategies that involved on one hand, dedicated fields for QC-generated meta-data and specialized queries and global permissions for senior curators and on the other, to establish a set of metrics to quantify its contents.

Since the first publication of this database, Dr. PIAS has been updated to version 2.0. PPI data have been increased considerably, from 71 500 to 83 324 entries. As the new positive instances in our method, 4 PPIs and 10 tertiary structures have been added. This addition increases the prediction accuracy of our SVM classifier in comparison with the previous classifier, despite the number of added PPIs and structures is small. We have introduced the novel concept of ‘similar positives’ of druggable PPIs, which will help researchers discover small compounds that can inhibit predicted druggable PPIs. Dr. PIAS will aid the effective search for druggable PPIs from a mine of interactome data being rapidly accumulated.

Polyphenols are rarely absorbed and excreted in their ingested forms, but extensively metabolized in the body, and until now, no database has allowed the recall of identities and concentrations of polyphenol metabolites in biofluids after the consumption of polyphenol-rich sources. Knowledge of these metabolites is essential in the planning of experiments whose aim is to elucidate the effects of polyphenols on health. Release 2.0 is the first major update of the database, allowing the rapid retrieval of data on the biotransformations and pharmacokinetics of dietary polyphenols. Data on 375 polyphenol metabolites identified in urine and plasma were collected from 236 peer-reviewed publications on polyphenol metabolism in humans and experimental animals and added to the database by means of an extended relational design. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been collected and can be retrieved in both tabular and graphical form. The web interface has been enhanced and now allows the filtering of information according to various criteria. Phenol-Explorer 2.0, which will be periodically updated, should prove to be an even more useful and capable resource for polyphenol scientists because bioactivities and health effects of polyphenols are dependent on the nature and concentrations of metabolites reaching the target tissues.

The same principle is used in laboratory to extend the natural biodiversity to obtain better catalysts for applications in biomanufacturing or for improved biopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, single mutation in genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes can also result in dramatic changes in pharmacokinetics. These changes are a major cause of patient-specific drug responses and are, therefore, the molecular basis for personalized medicine. MuteinDB systematically links laboratory-generated enzyme variants (muteins) and natural isoforms with their biochemical properties including kinetic data of catalyzed reactions. Detailed information about kinetic characteristics of muteins is available in a systematic way and searchable for known mutations and catalyzed reactions as well as their substrates and known products. MuteinDB is broadly applicable to any known protein and their variants and makes mutagenesis and biochemical data searchable and comparable in a simple and easy-to-use manner. For the import of new mutein data, a simple, standardized, spreadsheet-based data format has been defined.

For such knock-down/screening purposes, different companies offer sets of oligos/reagents targeting the whole genome or a subset of it for various organisms. Obviously, the sequence (and structure) of the corresponding oligos is a key factor in obtaining reliable results in these large-scale studies and the companies use a variety of (often not fully public) algorithms to design them. Nevertheless, as the genome annotations are still continuously changing, oligos may become obsolete, so siRNA reagents should be periodically re-annotated according to the latest version of the sequence database (which of course has serious consequences also on the interpretation of the screening results). In our article, we would like to introduce a new software/database tool, the RNAiAtlas.

Data sets are also being described by their authors in publications archived in literature databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed Central. Currently, the curation of links between biological databases and the literature mainly relies on manual labour, which makes it a time-consuming and daunting task. Herein, we analysed the current state of link curation between GEO, PDB and MEDLINE. We found that the link curation is heterogeneous depending on the sources and databases involved, and that overlap between sources is low, <50% for PDB and GEO. Furthermore, we showed that text-mining tools can automatically provide valuable evidence to help curators broaden the scope of articles and database entries that they review.

Out-of-frame ATI is a process by which a single mRNA encodes independent proteins, when distinct initiation codons located in different reading frames are recognized by a ribosome to initiate translation. This mechanism is largely used in viruses to increase the coding potential of small viral genomes. There is increasing evidence that out-of-frame ATI is also used in eukaryotes, including human, and may contribute to the diversity of the human proteome. HAltORF is the first web-based searchable database that allows thorough investigation in the human transcriptome of out-of-frame alternative open reading frames with a start codon located in a strong Kozak context, and are thus the more likely to be expressed. It is also the first large scale study on the human transcriptome to successfully predict the expression of out-of-frame ATI protein products that were previously discovered experimentally.

Thorpe,John C. Dittmar,Rodney Rothstein	NULL	Systematic biological screens typically identify many genes or proteins that are implicated in a specific phenotype. However, deriving mechanistic insight from these screens typically involves focusing upon one or a few genes within the set in order to elucidate their precise role in producing the phenotype. To find these critical genes, researchers use a variety of tools to query the set of genes to uncover underlying common genetic or physical interactions or common functional annotations (e.g. gene ontology terms). Not only it is necessary to find previous screens containing genes in common with the new set, but also useful to easily access the individual manuscript or study that classified those genes. Unfortunately, no tool currently exists to facilitate this task. We have developed a web-based tool (ScreenTroll) that queries one or more genes against a database of systematic yeast screens. The software determines which genome-wide yeast screens also identified the queried gene(s) and the resulting screens are listed in an order based on the extent of the overlap between the queried gene(s) and the open reading frames (ORFs) characterized in each individual yeast screen. In a separate list, the corresponding ORFs that are found in both the queried set of genes and each individual genome-wide screen are displayed along with links to the relevant manuscript via NIH’s PubMed database. ScreenTroll is useful for comparing a list of ORFs with genes identified in a wide array of published genome-wide screens. This comparison informs users whether any of their queried ORFs overlaps a previous study in the ScreenTroll database. By listing the manuscript of the published screen, users can read more about the phenotype associated with that study. Together, this information provides insight into the function of the queried genes and helps the user focus on a subset of them.	2012-04-20	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000304919300001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/435229/ScreenTroll-a-searchable-database-to-compare	10.1093/database/bas022	10436161,19903479,16420673,19033363,12431279,18085829,12140549,20093466,18420932,19150434,19638689,9928483,21151954,14661025,12072451,18454191,10688190,19060904,19176519,19465394,20656902	http://www.rothsteinlab.com/tools/apps/screenTroll	NULL	NULL	ScreenTroll	http://www.rothsteinlab.com/tools/apps/screenTroll	database

Fingerprints are groups of conserved motifs, evident in multiple sequence alignments, whose unique inter-relationships provide distinctive signatures for particular protein families and structural/functional domains. As such, they may be used to assign uncharacterized sequences to known families, and hence to infer tentative functional, structural and/or evolutionary relationships. The February 2012 release (version 42.0) includes 2156 fingerprints, encoding 12 444 individual motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on.

In past, cell penetrating peptides have been successfully used for delivering a wide variety of therapeutic molecules into various types of cells for the treatment of multiple diseases. These peptides have unique ability to gain access to the interior of almost any type of cell. Due to the huge therapeutic applications of CPPs, we have built a comprehensive database ‘CPPsite’, of cell penetrating peptides, where information is compiled from the literature and patents. CPPsite is a manually curated database of experimentally validated 843 CPPs. Each entry provides information of a peptide that includes ID, PubMed ID, peptide name, peptide sequence, chirality, origin, nature of peptide, sub-cellular localization, uptake efficiency, uptake mechanism, hydrophobicity, amino acid frequency and composition, etc. A wide range of user-friendly tools have been incorporated in this database like searching, browsing, analyzing, mapping tools. In addition, we have derived various types of information from these peptide sequences that include secondary/tertiary structure, amino acid composition and physicochemical properties of peptides. This database will be very useful for developing models for predicting effective cell penetrating peptides.Database URL:http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/.	2012-03-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000304917600001&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/433714/CPPsite-a-curated-database-of-cell-penetrating	10.1093/database/bas015	17408239,10983732,21840374,20237640,19538995,18045726,19523755,18563254,18001077,19782720,16267030,15952060,20214875,17897087,6667333,6383201,2231712,10547837,17587406,21687343	http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/,http://www.jmol.org,http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	CPPsite	http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/	database

Text mining (TM) has been used to enhance the process of manual biocuration, but has been focused on specific databases and tasks rather than an environment integrating TM tools into the curation pipeline, catering for a variety of tasks, types of information and applications. Processing components usually come from different sources and often lack interoperability. The well established Unstructured Information Management Architecture is a framework that addresses interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. However, most of the efforts are targeted towards software developers and are not suitable for curators, or are otherwise inconvenient to use on a higher level of abstraction. To overcome these issues we introduce Argo, an interoperable, integrative, interactive and collaborative system for text analysis with a convenient graphic user interface to ease the development of processing workflows and boost productivity in labour-intensive manual curation. Robust, scalable text analytics follow a modular approach, adopting component modules for distinct levels of text analysis. The user interface is available entirely through a web browser that saves the user from going through often complicated and platform-dependent installation procedures. Argo comes with a predefined set of processing components commonly used in text analysis, while giving the users the ability to deposit their own components. The system accommodates various areas and levels of user expertise, from TM and computational linguistics to ontology-based curation. One of the key functionalities of Argo is its ability to seamlessly incorporate user-interactive components, such as manual annotation editors, into otherwise completely automatic pipelines. As a use case, we demonstrate the functionality of an in-built manual annotation editor that is well suited for in-text corpus annotation tasks.Database URL:http://www.nactem.ac.uk/Argo	2012-02-13	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000304920200008&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/432774/Argo-an-integrative-interactive-text-mining-based	10.1093/database/bas010	20570001,17977867,16212775,18772154,18410678,21633495,18230184,19414535,19814812,12689350,19622167,16845108,18426550	http://www.nactem.ac.uk/Argo,http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8080/UCR/Welcome.do,https://cabig-kc.nci.nih.gov/Vocab/KC/index.php/OHNLP,http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/home/wiki.cgi?page=XConc+Suite,http://code.google.com/webtoolkit,http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/,http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=tttttttt	NULL	Argo	http://www.nactem.ac.uk/Argo	NULL

The CCDS data set reflects a ‘gold standard’ definition of best supported protein annotations, and corresponding genes, which pass a standard series of quality assurance checks and are supported by manual curation. This data set supports use of genome annotation information by human and mouse researchers for effective experimental design, analysis and interpretation. The CCDS project consists of analysis of automated whole-genome annotation builds to identify identical CDS annotations, quality assurance testing and manual curation support. Identical CDS annotations are tracked with a CCDS identifier (ID) and any future change to the annotated CDS structure must be agreed upon by the collaborating members. CCDS curation guidelines were developed to address some aspects of curation in order to improve initial annotation consistency and to reduce time spent in discussing proposed annotation updates. Here, we present the current status of the CCDS database and details on our procedures to track and coordinate our efforts. We also present the relevant background and reasoning behind the curation standards that we have developed for CCDS database treatment of transcripts that are nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) candidates, for transcripts containing upstream open reading frames, for identifying the most likely translation start codons and for the annotation of readthrough transcripts.

Padbury	NULL	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) query the entire genome in a hypothesis-free, unbiased manner. Since they have the potential for identifying novel genetic variants, they have become a very popular approach to the investigation of complex diseases. Nonetheless, since the success of the GWAS approach varies widely, the identification of genetic variants for complex diseases remains a difficult problem. We developed a novel bioinformatics approach to identify the nominal genetic variants associated with complex diseases. To test the feasibility of our approach, we developed a web-based aggregation tool to organize the genes, genetic variations and pathways involved in preterm birth. We used semantic data mining to extract all published articles related to preterm birth. All articles were reviewed by a team of curators. Genes identified from public databases and archives of expression arrays were aggregated with genes curated from the literature.

To aid with interpretation of results, InterPro entries are manually annotated with terms from the Gene Ontology (GO). The InterPro2GO mappings are comprised of the cross-references between these two resources and are the largest source of GO annotation predictions for proteins. Here, we describe the protocol by which InterPro curators integrate GO terms into the InterPro database. We discuss the unique challenges involved in integrating specific GO terms with entries that may describe a diverse set of proteins, and we illustrate, with examples, how InterPro hierarchies reflect GO terms of increasing specificity. We describe a revised protocol for GO mapping that enables us to assign GO terms to domains based on the function of the individual domain, rather than the function of the families in which the domain is found. We also discuss how taxonomic constraints are dealt with and those cases where we are unable to add any appropriate GO terms. Expert manual annotation of InterPro entries with GO terms enables users to infer function, process or subcellular information for uncharacterized sequences based on sequence matches to predictive models.Database URL:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro.

Partridge	NULL	Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often due to acquisition of resistance genes associated with different mobile genetic elements. In Gram-negative bacteria, many resistance genes are found as part of small mobile genetic elements called gene cassettes, generally found integrated into larger elements called integrons. Integrons carrying antibiotic resistance gene cassettes are often associated with mobile elements and here are designated ‘mobile resistance integrons’ (MRIs). More than one cassette can be inserted in the same integron to create arrays that contribute to the spread of multi-resistance. In many sequences in databases such as GenBank, only the genes within cassettes, rather than whole cassettes, are annotated and the same gene/cassette may be given different names in different entries, hampering analysis. We have developed the Repository of Antibiotic resistance Cassettes (RAC) website to provide an archive of gene cassettes that includes alternative gene names from multiple nomenclature systems and allows the community to contribute new cassettes. RAC also offers an additional function that allows users to submit sequences containing cassettes or arrays for annotation using the automatic annotation system Attacca. Attacca recognizes features (gene cassettes, integron regions) and identifies cassette arrays as patterns of features and can also distinguish minor cassette variants that may encode different resistance phenotypes (aacA4cassettes andblacassettes-encoding β-lactamases). Gaps in annotations are manually reviewed and those found to correspond to novel cassettes are assigned unique names. While there are other websites dedicated to integrons or antibiotic resistance genes, none includes a complete list of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes in MRI or offers consistent annotation and appropriate naming of all of these cassettes in submitted sequences. RAC thus provides a unique resource for researchers, which should reduce confusion and improve the quality of annotations of gene cassettes in integrons associated with antibiotic resistance.Database URL:http://www2.chi.unsw.edu.au/rac.	2011-12-02	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600056&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/470201/RAC-Repository-of-Antibiotic-resistance-Cassettes	10.1093/database/bar054	21517914,19416365,20707672,2560119,18487337,21564142,11872723,12003943,20041216,11266430,12618374,19383137,19228805,18832362,1577689,16369542,19735578,10415511,21258064,2231712	http://www2.chi.unsw.edu.au/rac,http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py?form=xxr,http://integron.biochem.dal.ca/ACID/phpbb3/,http://integrall.bio.ua.pt/,http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu,http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca,http://www.lahey.org/Studies/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	RAC	http://www2.chi.unsw.edu.au/rac	NULL

Côté,David Ovelleiro,Peter D'Eustachio,Henning Hermjakob,Juan A. Vizcaíno,David Croft	NULL	The reversible phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine hydroxyl groups is an especially prominent form of post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins. It plays critical roles in the regulation of diverse processes, and mutations that directly or indirectly affect these phosphorylation events have been associated with many cancers and other pathologies. Here, we describe the development of a new BioMart tool that gathers data from three different biological resources to provide the user with an integrated view of phosphorylation events associated with a human protein of interest, the complexes of which the protein (modified or not) is a part, the reactions in which the protein and its complexes participate and the somatic mutations that might be expected to perturb those functions. The three resources used are the Reactome, PRIDE and COSMIC databases. The Reactome knowledgebase contains annotations of phosphorylated human proteins linked to the reactions in which they are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, to the complexes of which they are parts and to the reactions in which the phosphorylated proteins participate as substrates, catalysts and regulators. The PRIDE database holds extensive mass spectrometry data from which protein phosphorylation patterns can be inferred, and the COSMIC database holds records of somatic mutations found in human cancer cells. This tool supports both flexible, user-specified queries and standard (‘canned’) queries to retrieve frequently used combinations of data for user-specified proteins and reactions. We demonstrate using the Wnt signaling pathway and the human c-SRC protein how the tool can be used to place somatic mutation data into a functional perspective by changing critical residues involved in pathway modulation, and where available, check for mass spectrometry evidence in PRIDE supporting identification of the critical residue.Database URL:http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/mart	2011-10-22	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600049&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/468739/Critical-amino-acid-residues-in-proteins-a-BioMart	10.1093/database/bar047	19498976,16204703,21080489,19906717,21067998,20952405,19420058,19884133,18688235,15174122,15174123,17306971,16105882,12717450,12000790,17143297,17150037,9988270,9602534,10804287,20047291,12870441,17327847,21325204,16964243,20234177	http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/mart,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride,http://www.reactome.org,http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/,http://www.biomart.org	NULL	NULL	BioMart	http://www.biomart.org	NULL

In this article, we present AnnotCompute, an information discovery platform for repositories of functional genomics experiments such as ArrayExpress. Our system leverages semantic annotations of functional genomics experiments with controlled vocabulary and ontology terms, such as those from the MGED Ontology, to compute conceptual dissimilarities between pairs of experiments. These dissimilarities are then used to support two types of exploratory analysis—clustering and query-by-example. We show that our proposed dissimilarity measures correspond to a user's intuition about conceptual dissimilarity, and can be used to support effective query-by-example. We also evaluate the quality of clustering based on these measures. While AnnotCompute can support a richer data exploration experience, its effectiveness is limited in some cases, due to the quality of available annotations.

Availability of a tailored online database is the desire for many investigators or research communities; however, managing the Information Technology infrastructure needed to create such a database can be an undesired distraction from primary research or potentially cost prohibitive. Tripal provides simplified site development by merging the power of Drupal, a popular web Content Management System with that of Chado, a community-derived database schema for storage of genomic, genetic and other related biological data. Tripal provides an interface that extends the content management features of Drupal to the data housed in Chado. Furthermore, Tripal provides a web-based Chado installer, genomic data loaders, web-based editing of data for organisms, genomic features, biological libraries, controlled vocabularies and stock collections. Also available are Tripal extensions that support loading and visualizations of NCBI BLAST, InterPro, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology analyses, as well as an extension that provides integration of Tripal with GBrowse, a popular GMOD tool. An Application Programming Interface is available to allow creation of custom extensions by site developers, and the look-and-feel of the site is completely customizable through Drupal-based PHP template files. Addition of non-biological content and user-management is afforded through Drupal.

Cooley	NULL	The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Central Repository makes data and biospecimens from NIDDK-funded research available to the broader scientific community. It thereby facilitates: the testing of new hypotheses without new data or biospecimen collection; pooling data across several studies to increase statistical power; and informative genetic analyses using the Repository’s well-curated phenotypic data. This article describes the initial database plan for the Repository and its revision using a simpler model. Among the lessons learned were the trade-offs between the complexity of a database design and the costs in time and money of implementation; the importance of integrating consent documents into the basic design; the crucial need for linkage files that associate biospecimen IDs with themaskedsubject IDs used in deposited data sets; and the importance of standardized procedures to test the integrity data sets prior to distribution. The Repository is currently tracking 111 ongoing NIDDK-funded studies many of which include genotype data, and it houses over 5 million biospecimens of more than 25 types including serum, plasma, stool, urine, DNA, red blood cells, buffy coat and tissue. Repository resources have supported a range of biochemical, clinical, statistical and genetic research (188 external requests for clinical data and 31 for biospecimens have been approved or are pending). Genetic research has included GWAS, validation studies, development of methods to improve statistical power of GWAS and testing of new statistical methods for genetic research. We anticipate that the future impact of the Repository’s resources on biomedical research will be enhanced by (i) cross-listing of Repository biospecimens in additional searchable databases and biobank catalogs; (ii) ongoing deployment of new applications for querying the contents of the Repository; and (iii) increased harmonization of procedures, data collection strategies, questionnaires etc. across both research studies and within the vocabularies used by different repositories.Database URL:http://www.niddkrepository.org	2011-09-29	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600045&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/468002/The-NIDDK-Central-Repository-at-8-years-Ambition	10.1093/database/bar043	18028443,18040661,19763126,19549736,18650371,17384010,17327345,16801566,17882397,20179795,16801607,17192365,17192363,18223010,18502191,19875614,17914031,18840781,19651817,19252134,19924099,18753673,19430480,16775037,17554300,20813861,20154612,21749974	http://www.niddkrepository.org,http://www.niddkrepository.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap,http://www2.bsc.gwu.edu/bsc/oneproj.php?pkey=10,http://www.niddkrepository.org/niddk/jsp/public/IBD/IBDMetadata.jsp,https://www.niddkrepository.org/niddk/jsp/public/dataset.jsp,http://www.niddkrepository.org,http://www.med.emory.edu/research/GCRC/SIGT,http://www.datashaper.org/,http://www.niddkrepository.org/niddk/jsp/public/websites.jsp,http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/TBPT/CBM/,http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/TBPT/CBM/,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html,http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/TBPT/CBM/,http://www.niddkrepository.org/niddk/jsp/public/dataset.jsp	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=tttttttt	NULL	NIDDK	http://www.niddkrepository.org	NULL

This phenomenon is observed in an array of protein structures in oligomeric conformation. Protein structures in swapped conformations perform diverse functional roles and are also associated with deposition diseases in humans. We have performed in-depth literature curation and structural bioinformatics analyses to develop an integrated knowledgebase of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. The hallmark of 3D domain swapping is the presence of distinct structural segments such as the hinge and swapped regions. We have curated the literature to delineate the boundaries of these regions. In addition, we have defined several new concepts like ‘secondary major interface’ to represent the interface properties arising as a result of 3D domain swapping, and a new quantitative measure for the ‘extent of swapping’ in structures. The catalog of proteins reported in 3DSwap knowledgebase has been generated using an integrated structural bioinformatics workflow of database searches, literature curation, by structure visualization and sequence–structure–function analyses. The current version of the 3DSwap knowledgebase reports 293 protein structures, the analysis of such a compendium of protein structures will further the understanding molecular factors driving 3D domain swapping.Database URL:http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3dswap	2011-09-29	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600044&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/467496/3DSwap-curated-knowledgebase-of-proteins-involved	10.1093/database/bar042	4565129,4124164,11948785,4737475,15837175,11590012,12838343,19756040,12461820,9787643,15993087,8143488,7552745,12021428,16061250,7833807,14023811,5842060,17391511,11995994,15296726,16698543,8580836,18220844,20106655,12727507,9502314,20471398,9338079,18625227,17669270,10373555,18976659,15159444,10838566,17215157,17367384,16204848,10673427,15736946,17439156,17718592,16055542,17763469,11008068,20634983,20976204,12223084,10543951,9731771,10731426,10896951,9609684,15664185,11276250,10195279,8939745,10801490,15211526,9760233,17142228,17626865,17384425,7795532,15980441,17977867,18614002,19858099,10973060,7482707,17998252,16845026,19858104,9254694,9730927,6667333,18957448,19920124,15608192,20585573,19033274,15215404,17135202,21109532,18288329,10592278,15130850,20305270,18769432,20587024,19934259,18849571,17130148,17090586,16381935,9399803,18613750,18651794,18996897,21045058,18978020,19919682	http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3dswap	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	3DSwap	http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3dswap	app

Anybody can contribute an independently maintained resource to the Central Portal, allowing it to be exposed to and shared with the research community, and linking it with the other resources in the portal. Users can take advantage of the common interface to quickly utilize different sources without learning a new system for each. The system also simplifies cross-database searches that might otherwise require several complicated steps. Several integrated tools streamline common tasks, such as converting between ID formats and retrieving sequences. The combination of a wide variety of databases, an easy-to-use interface, robust programmatic access and the array of tools make Central Portal a one-stop shop for biological data querying.

High-throughput quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is an ideal technique to accurately quantify nucleic acid sequences including splice variants. However, currently available primer design programs do not distinguish between splice variants and also differ substantially in overall quality, functionality or throughput mode. Here, we present GETPrime, a primer database supported by a novel platform that uniquely combines and automates several features critical for optimal qPCR primer design. These include the consideration of all gene splice variants to enable either gene-specific (covering the majority of splice variants) or transcript-specific (covering one splice variant) expression profiling, primer specificity validation, automated best primer pair selection according to strict criteria and graphical visualization of the latter primer pairs within their genomic context. GETPrime primers have been extensively validated experimentally, demonstrating high transcript specificity in complex samples.

By non-redundant, we mean that the accounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each independent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less. While many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them contains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition, the annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often disagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while consolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including interactions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein nomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in comprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all information/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform additional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals. Another issue has to do with protein complexes. Some databases represent experimentally observed complexes as interactions with more than two participants, while others expand them into binary interactions using spoke or matrix model. To avoid untested interaction information buildup, it is preferable to replace the expanded protein complexes, either from spoke or matrix models, with a flat list of complex members.To address these issues and to achieve our goals, we have developed ppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant, consistently annotated data sets of physical interactions. Our script proceeds in three stages: mapping all interactants to gene identifiers and removing all undesired raw interactions, deflating potentially expanded complexes, and reconciling for each interaction the annotation labels among different source databases. As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal data sets: yeast, human and fruitfly. While ppiTrim can resolve most apparent conflicts between different labelings, we also discovered some unresolvable disagreements mostly resulting from different annotation policies among repositories.Database URL:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/ppiTrim.html	2011-08-27	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600038&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/466398/ppiTrim-constructing-non-redundant-and-up-to-date	10.1093/database/bar036	21071413,19850723,19897547,14681454,15608229,18988627,19116613,17893861,17925023,17903286,19381530,20024067,19070972,20061351,19884131,16381906,15531608,15657099,18823568,19561335,21115458,19843607,17989687,14764870,17200106,16429126,16554755,10802651,18954448,15590687,21067998,9799240	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/ppiTrim.html,http://ftp.no.embnet.org/irefindex/data/current/Mappingfiles/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=2&types=tttttttt	NULL	ppiTrim	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/ppiTrim.html	NULL

MaizeGDB has transitioned from a focus on comprehensive curation of the literature, genetic maps and stocks to a paradigm that accommodates the recent release of a reference maize genome sequence, multiple diverse maize genomes and sequence-based gene expression data sets. The MaizeGDB Team is relatively small, and relies heavily on the research community to provide data, nomenclature standards and most importantly, to recommend future directions, priorities and strategies. Key aspects of MaizeGDB's intimate interaction with the community are the co-location of curators with maize research groups in multiple locations across the USA as well as coordination with MaizeGDB’s close partner, the Maize Genetics Cooperation—Stock Center. In this report, we describe how the MaizeGDB Team currently interacts with the maize research community and our plan for future interactions that will support updates to the functional and structural annotation of the B73 reference genome.	2011-05-28	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600024&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/464959/MaizeGDB-curation-and-outreach-go-hand-in-hand	10.1093/database/bar022	19965430,15888678,18769432,15383839,10802651,17409087,15879515,18287701,17202174,20008513,18287702,18063570,19616467,19207214,18539775,19206469,20550134,17764504,20581308,20228246,20223762,21070762,20613864,19734266,19936069,19936061,19823591,19965431,19602622,20214371,19661427,20404497,18997117,19895398,14501073,18202289,16395569,16010002,20972441,20124413,16167895,16951074,18194960,2231712,16859520,16951073,21037569	http://www.maizegdb.org/steering_committee.php,http://www.maizegdb.org/cgi-bin/editorial_board.cgi,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://sam.truman.edu/,http://www.maizegdb.org/mgec.php,http://www.maizegdb.org/AllertonReport.doc,http://www.soybase.org,http://www.plexdb.org,http://www.plantgdb.org,http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/site_main.htm?modecode=36-25-12-00,http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu,http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/cgclist.html,http://www.maizegdb.org/cooperators.php,http://www.maizegdb.org/cgi-bin/locus_lookup.cgi?id=,http://www.maizegdb.org/cgi-bin/displayseqrecord.cgi?id=X57276,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/542724,http://www.plantgdb.org/ZmGDB,http://www.jgi.doe.gov/,http://www.jgi.doe.gov/,http://www.PLAntontology.org,http://www.maizegdb.org/assembly.php,http://dnasubway.iplantcollaborative.org,http://www.maizegdb.org/maize_meeting/,http://www.ncga.org,http://hinv.jp/biocuration2010/index.html,http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5258/version/1	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL	MaizeGDB	http://www.maizegdb.org/steering_committee.php	NULL

In the past decade, at least nine drugs, i.e. terfenadine, astemizole, grepafloxacin, terodiline, droperidol, lidoflazine, sertindole, levomethadyl and cisapride, have been removed from the market or their use has been severely restricted because of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Therefore, this irregularity is a major safety concern in the case of drugs submitted for regulatory approval. The most common mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation may be drug-related inhibition of the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, which subsequently results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). hERGAPDbase is a database of electrophysiological experimental data documenting potential hERG channel inhibitory actions and the APD-prolongation activities of chemical compounds. All data entries are manually collected from scientific papers and curated by a person.

Thus, we have developed Allie, a database and a search service of abbreviations and their long forms (a.k.a. full forms or definitions). Allie searches for abbreviations and their corresponding long forms in a database that we have generated based on all titles and abstracts in MEDLINE. When a user query matches an abbreviation, Allie returns all potential long forms of the query along with their bibliographic data (i.e.title and publication year). In addition, for each candidate, co-occurring abbreviations and a research field in which it frequently appears in the MEDLINE data are displayed. This function helps users learn about the context in which an abbreviation appears. To deal with synonymous long forms, we use a dictionary called GENA that contains domain-specific terms such as gene, protein or disease names along with their synonymic information. Conceptually identical domain-specific terms are regarded as one term, and then conceptually identical abbreviation-long form pairs are grouped taking into account their appearance in MEDLINE. To keep up with new abbreviations that are continuously introduced, Allie has an automatic update system. In addition, the database of abbreviations and their long forms with their corresponding PubMed IDs is constructed and updated weekly.Database URL:The Allie service is available athttp://allie.dbcls.jp/.	2011-04-15	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:https%3a%2f%2facademic.oup.com%2fdatabase%2farticle%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fdatabase%2fbar013%2f463936%2fAllie-a-database-and-a-search-service-of	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/463936/Allie-a-database-and-a-search-service-of	10.1093/database/bar013	12386112,10886074,17050571,9927719,16982707,19958517,20360059,15905486,18817555	http://allie.dbcls.jp/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9676/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=16&types=bbbbtttt	NULL	Allie	http://allie.dbcls.jp/	database

Douglas,Toni Gabaldón,Marie-France Sagot,Hubert Charles,Stefano Colella	NULL	In recent years, genomes from an increasing number of organisms have been sequenced, but their annotation remains a time-consuming process. The BioCyc databases offer a framework for the integrated analysis of metabolic networks. The Pathway tool software suite allows the automated construction of a database starting from an annotated genome, but it requires prior integration of all annotations into a specific summary file or into a GenBank file. To allow the easy creation and update of a BioCyc database starting from the multiple genome annotation resources available over time, we have developed anad hocdata management system that we called Cyc Annotation Database System (CycADS). CycADS is centred on a specific database model and on a set of Java programs to import, filter and export relevant information. Data from GenBank and other annotation sources (including for example: KAAS, PRIAM, Blast2GO and PhylomeDB) are collected into a database to be subsequently filtered and extracted to generate a complete annotation file. This file is then used to build an enriched BioCyc database using the PathoLogic program of Pathway Tools. The CycADS pipeline for annotation management was used to build the AcypiCyc database for the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) whose genome was recently sequenced. The AcypiCyc database webpage includes also, for comparative analyses, two other metabolic reconstruction BioCyc databases generated using CycADS: TricaCyc forTribolium castaneumand DromeCyc forDrosophila melanogaster. Linked to its flexible design, CycADS offers a powerful software tool for the generation and regular updating of enriched BioCyc databases. The CycADS system is particularly suited for metabolic gene annotation and network reconstruction in newly sequenced genomes. Because of the uniform annotation used for metabolic network reconstruction, CycADS is particularly useful for comparative analysis of the metabolism of different organisms.Database URL:http://www.cycadsys.org	2011-04-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/463009/CycADS-an-annotation-database-system-to-ease-the	10.1093/database/bar008	18262675,19955237,12169551,8594595,11752253,11752254,17965431,16246909,20186266,18362917,17646315,16556315,15723693,17237053,19820115,18948289,17526522,16081474,14602924,17962297,20482636,20070885,18983710,5449325,20482655	http://www.cycadsys.org,http://biocyc.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html,http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml,http://code.cycadsys.org,http://www.biosql.org,http://code.cycadsys.org,http://code.cycadsys.org,http://www.aphidbase.com/aphidbase/,http://beetlebase.org/,http://flybase.org/,http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/,http://www.blast2go.org/,http://priam.prabi.fr/,http://acypicyc.cycadsys.org,http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml,http://www.aduna-software.com/technology/clustermap,http://www.aduna-software.com/technology/clustermap,http://www.cycadsys.org,http://www.metnet4sysbio.org/,http://www.prabi.fr	NULL	NULL	CycADS	http://www.cycadsys.org	database

To help reverse this trend, we converted BIND to a standard format, Proteomics Standard Initiative-Molecular Interaction 2.5, starting from the last curated data release (from 2005) available in a custom XML format and made the core components (interactions and complexes) plus additional valuable curated information available for download (http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/). Major work during the conversion process was required to update out of date molecule identifiers resulting in a more comprehensive conversion of BIND, by measures including number of species and interactor types covered, than what is currently accessible elsewhere. This work also highlights issues of data modeling, controlled vocabulary adoption and data cleaning that can serve as a general case study on the future compatibility of interaction databases.Database URL:http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/	2011-01-13	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000299630600004&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/461120/The-Biomolecular-Interaction-Network-Database-in	10.1093/database/baq037	15608229,12519993,11125103,17846617,18000002,18988627,19850723,19594875,15117749,18984619,16381926,18766178,18823568,16845013,18978014,14597658,18940858,18988626,17535438,11987160,14755292,19834897,10871269,17687370,12355115,18467421,19843607,17130148,17148479,11449735,18975926,11995340,15588483,10802651,18078503,20829833	http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/,http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/,http://bond.unleashedinformatics.com/,http://bond.unleashedinformatics.com/downloads/data/BIND/data/,http://wodaklab.org/iRefWeb/statistics/index,http://bond.unleashedinformatics.com/downloads/data/BIND/spec/,http://software.dumontierlab.com/asn-browser/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/validator/start.xhtml,http://baderlab.org/BINDTranslation,http://www.sun.com,http://www.altova.com/,http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/,http://www.info.crossfiredatabases.com/home.shtml,http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/,http://www.merckbooks.com/mindex/,http://dictybase.org/,http://www.genenames.org/,http://www.plantgdb.org/,http://www.ratmap.org/,http://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://plantta.jcvi.org/,http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-ZDB_home.apg,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/,http://www.info.crossfiredatabases.com/home.shtml,http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/,http://www.merckbooks.com/mindex/,http://dictybase.org/,http://www.genenames.org/,http://www.plantgdb.org/,http://www.ratmap.org/,http://www.arabidopsis.org/,http://plantta.jcvi.org/,http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-ZDB_home.apg,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/,http://webservice.baderlab.org:8180/psicquic-ws/,http://download.baderlab.org/BINDTranslation/,http://ecocyc.org	NULL	NULL	PSI-MI	http://www.arabidopsis.org/	NULL

Harrison	NULL	Compositional bias (i.e. a skew in the composition of a biological sequence towards a subset of residue types) can occur at a wide variety of scales, from compositional biases of whole genomes, down to short regions in individual protein and gene–DNA sequences that are compositionally biased (CB regions). Such CB regions are made from a subset of residue types that are strewn along the length of the region in an irregular way. Here, we have developed the database server LPS-annotate, for the analysis of such CB regions, and protein disorder in protein sequences. The algorithm defines compositional bias through a thorough search for lowest-probability subsequences (LPSs) (i.e., the least likely sequence regions in terms of composition). Users can (i) initially annotate CB regions in input protein or nucleotide sequences of interest, and then (ii) query a database of greater than 1 500 000 pre-calculated protein-CB regions, for investigation of further functional hypotheses and inferences, about the specific CB regions that were discovered, and their protein disorder propensities. We demonstrate how a user can search for CB regions of similar compositional bias and protein disorder, with a worked example. We show that our annotations substantially augment the CB-region annotations that already exist in the UniProt database, with more comprehensive annotation of more complex CB regions. Our analysis indicates tens of thousands of CB regions that do not comprise globular domains or transmembrane domains, and that do not have a propensity to protein disorder, indicating a large cohort of protein-CB regions of biophysically uncharacterized types. This server and database is a conceptually novel addition to the workbench of tools now available to molecular biologists to generate hypotheses and inferences about the proteins that they are investigating.

The database contains sites for 115 different transcription factors (TFs). TFBS were identified with positional weight matrices (PWMs) or with single binding sites. With the new web tool ‘Gene Identification’, it is possible to identify potential target genes for selected TFs. For these analyses, the user can define a region of interest of up to 6000 bp in all annotated genes. For TFBS determined with PWMs, the search can be restricted to high-quality TFBS.

Hall,Daniel A. Holdbrook,Syma Khalid,Philip C. Biggin	NULL	Molecular dynamics simulations can now routinely generate data sets of several hundreds of gigabytes in size. The ability to generate this data has become easier over recent years and the rate of data production is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. One major problem associated with this vast amount of data is how to store it in a way that it can be easily retrieved at a later date. The obvious answer to this problem is a database. However, a key issue in the development and maintenance of such a database is its sustainability, which in turn depends on the ease of the deposition and retrieval process. Encouraging users to care about meta-data is difficult and thus the success of any storage system will ultimately depend on how well used by end-users the system is. In this respect we suggest that even a minimal amount of metadata if stored in a sensible fashion is useful, if only at the level of individual research groups. We discuss here, a simple database system which we call ‘Bookshelf’, that uses python in conjunction with a mysql database to provide an extremely simple system for curating and keeping track of molecular simulation data. It provides a user-friendly, scriptable solution to the common problem amongst biomolecular simulation laboratories; the storage, logging and subsequent retrieval of large numbers of simulations.Download URL:http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/bookshelf/	2010-12-17	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400033&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/409153/Bookshelf-a-simple-curation-system-for-the-storage	10.1093/database/baq033	19965766,15534698,17011806,26627017,18411223,18400182,20373735,17127622	http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/bookshelf/,http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/bookshelf/,http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/publications/policy/data-sharing-policy.aspx	NULL	NULL	Bookshelf	http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/bookshelf/	simulation

It is thus a source of information for life scientists as well as clinicians who are interested in gene expression and regulatory networks. The GermOnline gateway provides unlimited access to information produced with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (3′-UTR GeneChips), genome-wide protein–DNA binding assays and protein–protein interaction studies in the context of Ensembl genome annotation. Samples used to produce high-throughput expression data and to carry out genome-widein vivoDNA binding assays are annotated via the MIAME-compliant Multiomics Information Management and Annotation System (MIMAS 3.0). Furthermore, theSaccharomycesGenomics Viewer (SGV) was developed and integrated into the gateway. SGV is a visualization tool that outputs genome annotation and DNA-strand specific expression data produced with high-density oligonucleotide tiling microarrays (Sc_tlg GeneChips) which cover the complete budding yeast genome on both DNA strands. It facilitates the interpretation of expression levels and transcript structures determined for various cell types cultured under different growth and differentiation conditions.Database URL:www.germonline.org/	2010-12-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400032&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/409050/GermOnline-4-0-is-a-genomics-gateway-for-germline	10.1093/database/baq030	17191608,15239943,17486121,19015125,18940857,14744116,19906730,19956698,19169243,14647278,14681481,14751982,17145711,16355180,19450266,19906699,18000002,19850723,19148271,19055798,17545180,15713233,19144180,20193063,3887135,11101837,18305101,20716365,15343339,18728691,18507872,18613750,20941386,18945806,20221640,20167071,19040723,19015660,18820680	http://www.germonline.org/,http://www.ensembl.org,http://www.arabidopsis.org,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://www.cbrg.ethz.ch/oma,http://sourceforge.net/projects/awstats/	NULL	NULL	GermOnline	http://www.germonline.org/	NULL

Anderson,Patrick D. Kidd,Sepehr Eskandari	NULL	Since the cloning of the first γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT1; SLC6A1) from rat brain in 1990, more than 50 published studies have provided structure–function information on investigator-designed rat and mouse GAT1 mutants. To date, more than 200 of 599 GAT1 residues have been subjected to mutagenesis experiments by substitution with different amino acids, and the resulting transporter functional properties have significantly advanced our understanding of the mechanism of Na+- and Cl–-coupled GABA transport by this important member of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family. Moreover, many studies have addressed the functional consequences of amino acid deletion or insertion at various positions along the primary sequence. The enormity of this growing body of structure–function information has prompted us to develop GABA Transporter Mutagenesis Database (GATMD), a web-accessible, relational database of manually annotated biochemical, functional and pharmacological data reported on GAT1—the most intensely studied GABA transporter isoform. As of the last update of GATMD, 52 GAT1 mutagenesis papers have yielded 3360 experimental records, which collectively contain a total of ∼100 000 annotated parameters.Database URL:http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/	2010-12-02	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400030&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/408709/GATMD-Aminobutyric-Acid-Transporter-Mutagenesis	10.1093/database/baq028	8939442,9798903,14612144,12966170,15210304,15250587,19393020,20026354,12449427,12719981,16381841,17941992,6838850,2888595,3349023,10973981,17994179,18054861,19622377,1975955,2387399,1400419,7874447,7861179,1497897,1517200,1370453,8420981,12422272,15981712,1944572,1948036,1948035,2008212,1948034,1618338,16041361,17687333,19074341,17690258,16757479,17704762,18570870,19641126,20081826,18393466,19631523,19996368,18977735,19458710,12750889,12748858,16880288,11741236,14681414,17135193,16499625,14990452,17274683	http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/data_structure.xml,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/data_structure.xml,http://www.centos.org,http://www.apache.org,http://www.mysql.com,http://www.perl.org,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/search.html,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/tutorial.html,http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/formal_parameters.html,http://pharmacogenetics.ucsf.edu/,http://www.tcdb.org/,http://www.membranetransport.org/,http://www-abcdb.biotoul.fr/,http://icb.med.cornell.edu/trac/	NULL	NULL	GATMD	http://physiology.sci.csupomona.edu/GATMD/	NULL

Victor Jongeneel,Ioannis Xenarios	NULL	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major disease affecting nearly 280 million people worldwide. Whilst the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to disease are poorly understood, dysfunction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells is key event for disease development. Monitoring the gene expression profiles of pancreatic beta-cells under several genetic or chemical perturbations has shed light on genes and pathways involved in T2DM. The EuroDia database has been established to build a unique collection of gene expression measurements performed on beta-cells of three organisms, namely human, mouse and rat. The Gene Expression Data Analysis Interface (GEDAI) has been developed to support this database. The quality of each dataset is assessed by a series of quality control procedures to detect putative hybridization outliers. The system integrates a web interface to several standard analysis functions from R/Bioconductor to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. It also allows the combination of multiple experiments performed on different array platforms of the same technology. The design of this system enables each user to rapidly design a custom analysis pipeline and thus produce their own list of genes and pathways. Raw and normalized data can be downloaded for each experiment. The flexible engine of this database (GEDAI) is currently used to handle gene expression data from several laboratory-run projects dealing with different organisms and platforms.Database URL:http://eurodia.vital-it.ch	2010-10-12	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400027&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/407943/EuroDia-a-beta-cell-gene-expression-resource	10.1093/database/baq024	19487709,19015125,18940857,17169983,15608258,18045790,20346121,12925520,14597310,15461798,10802651,19880382,12689096,15044247,12134151,20371495,12176840,14960456,16982708,17098774,11726920,17071715,11334433,14600816,11687580,19934004,19289501,20523905,19188435,21099257,20644627,15980866,20145256,19401425,18025410	http://eurodia.vital-it.ch,http://www.diabetesatlas.org/content/diabetes-and-impaired-glucose-tolerance	NULL	NULL	EuroDia	http://eurodia.vital-it.ch	NULL

Kinjo,Reiko Yamashita,Haruki Nakamura	NULL	This article is a tutorial for PDBj Mine, a new database and its interface for Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj). In PDBj Mine, data are loaded from files in the PDBMLplus format (an extension of PDBML, PDB's canonical XML format, enriched with annotations), which are then served for the user of PDBj via the worldwide web (WWW). We describe the basic design of the relational database (RDB) and web interfaces of PDBj Mine. The contents of PDBMLplus files are first broken into XPath entities, and these paths and data are indexed in the way that reflects the hierarchical structure of the XML files. The data for each XPath type are saved into the corresponding relational table that is named as the XPath itself. The generation of table definitions from the PDBMLplus XML schema is fully automated. For efficient search, frequently queried terms are compiled into a brief summary table.

Its gene-centric content is automatically mined and integrated from over 80 digital sources, resulting in a web-based deep-linked card for each of >73 000 human gene entries, encompassing the following categories: protein coding, pseudogene, RNA gene, genetic locus, cluster and uncategorized. We now introduce GeneCards Version 3, featuring a speedy and sophisticated search engine and a revamped, technologically enabling infrastructure, catering to the expanding needs of biomedical researchers. A key focus is on gene-set analyses, which leverage GeneCards’ unique wealth of combinatorial annotations. These include the GeneALaCart batch query facility, which tabulates user-selected annotations for multiple genes and GeneDecks, which identifies similar genes with shared annotations, and finds set-shared annotations by descriptor enrichment analysis. Such set-centric features address a host of applications, including microarray data analysis, cross-database annotation mapping and gene-disorder associations for drug targeting. We highlight the new Version 3 database architecture, its multi-faceted search engine, and its semi-automated quality assurance system. Data enhancements include an expanded visualization of gene expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues, an integrated alternative splicing pattern display, and augmented multi-source SNPs and pathways sections. GeneCards now provides direct links to gene-related research reagents such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones and inhibitory RNAs and features gene-related drugs and compounds lists. We also portray the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Score annotation landscape tool for scoring a gene’s functional information status. Finally, we delineate examples of applications and collaborations that have benefited from the GeneCards suite.Database URL:www.genecards.org	2010-08-05	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400023&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/407450/GeneCards-Version-3-the-human-gene-integrator	10.1093/database/baq020	19852797,15608261,18005434	http://www.genecards.org,http://www.genecards.org,http://www.genecards.org,http://synlet.izbi.uni-leipzig.de/,http://www.genenames.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene,http://www.ensembl.org/index.html,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.genecards.org/sources.shtml,http://www.phosphosite.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/,http://oca.weizmann.ac.il/oca-bin/ocamain,http://proteopedia.org/,http://www.dsi.univ-paris5.fr/genatlas,http://escience.invitrogen.com/iPath/index.jsp,http://www.millipore.com/pathways/pw/pathways,http://www5.appliedbiosystems.com/tools/pathway/all_pathway_list.php,http://www.cellsignal.com/pathways/index.html,http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/,http://www.sabiosciences.com/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/main.xhtml,http://string.embl.de/,http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/Welcome.do,http://www.novoseek.com/,http://www.pharmgkb.org/,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd/,http://www.genecards.org/info.shtml#exp,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/,http://pupasuite.bioinfo.cipf.es/,http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GeneTests/,http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php,http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/,http://www.genecards.org/BatchOutputInfo.shtml,http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/,http://lucene.apache.org/,http://en.wikipedia.org/,http://www.bing.com/,http://lucene.apache.org/solr/,http://www.webdesignpractices.com/navigation/facets.html,http://www.webglimpse.org,http://dev.mysql.com/,http://www.genecards.org/v3//index.php?path=/GeneDecks,http://harvester.fzk.de/harvester/	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=wwwwwwww	NULL	GeneCards	http://www.genecards.org	NULL

Hamodrakas	NULL	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major family of membrane receptors in eukaryotic cells. They play a crucial role in the communication of a cell with the environment. Ligands bind to GPCRs on the outside of the cell, activating them by causing a conformational change, and allowing them to bind to G-proteins. Through their interaction with G-proteins, several effector molecules are activated leading to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. The great importance of GPCRs and their corresponding signal transduction pathways is indicated by the fact that they take part in many diverse disease processes and that a large part of efforts towards drug development today is focused on them. We present Human-gpDB, a database which currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-proteins and 99 human effectors. The collection of information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current version of Human-gpDB holds information for about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-proteins and 1618 connections between G-proteins and effectors. Major advantages of Human-gpDB are the integration of several external data sources and the support of advanced visualization techniques. Human-gpDB is a simple, yet a powerful tool for researchers in the life sciences field as it integrates an up-to-date, carefully curated collection of human GPCRs, G-proteins, effectors and their interactions. The database may be a reference guide for medical and pharmaceutical research, especially in the areas of understanding human diseases and chemical and drug discovery.Database URLs:http://schneider.embl.de/human_gpdb;http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/human_gpdb/	2010-08-05	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400022&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/406892/GPCRs-G-proteins-effectors-and-their-interactions	10.1093/database/baq019	18043707,18948278,12520006,8081729,15251227,12209124,15747061,11282406,18836194,19033362,19144180,18694895,17130148,8743683,16381823,15608257,18978020,12230031,18344544,18039703,12037327,8332531,12520061,11752252,14681407,18953024,18681788,10592173,17130144,18981052,17942422,16188923,18084021,12824421,15619328,18441001	http://schneider.embl.de/human_gpdb,http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/human_gpdb/,http://schneider.embl.de/human_gpdb,http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/human_gpdb/,http://schneider.embl.de/cgi-bin/human_gpdb.cgi?search=P21918,http://schneider.embl.de/cgi-bin/human_gpdb.cgi?search=DRD5_HUMAN,http://www.bioalma.com/aks2/index.php	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=1&types=11111111	NULL	human-gpDB	http://schneider.embl.de/human_gpdb	database

Browsing through these results and identifying relevant functional variations is a major hurdle in these genome-wide association studies. In order to help researchers locate the most promising associations, we have developed a web-based database portal called Varietas. Varietas can be used for retrieving information concerning genomic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants and insertions/deletions, while enabling users to annotate large number of variations in a batch like manner and to find information about related genes, phenotypes and diseases. Varietas also links out to various external genomic databases, allowing users to quickly browse through a set of variations and follow the most promising leads.

There are ∼1100 molecular biology databases dispersed throughout the Internet. To assist in the functional, structural and evolutionary analysis of the abundant number of novel proteins continually identified from whole-genome sequencing, we introduce the PROFESS (PROtein Function, Evolution, Structure and Sequence) database. Our database is designed to be versatile and expandable and will not confine analysis to a pre-existing set of data relationships. A fundamental component of this approach is the development of an intuitive query system that incorporates a variety of similarity functions capable of generating data relationships not conceived during the creation of the database. The utility of PROFESS is demonstrated by the analysis of the structural drift of homologous proteins and the identification of potential pancreatic cancer therapeutic targets based on the observation of protein–protein interaction networks.Database URL:http://cse.unl.edu/∼profess/	2010-06-26	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/404588/PROFESS-a-PROtein-Function-Evolution-Structure-and	10.1093/database/baq011	18188423,19033364,12788546,12000935,11125133,11238075,12511067,10592235,17942413,19900971,18836194,18039703,16381878,18077471,16606699,14681454,10547839,15941743,18974178,18996897,18000004,18818215,10980157,17588214,3709526,10195279,17174370,19474385,15169811,18378539,15604267,16230073,16285947,15897887,18772397,18294838,16890805,14597658,16862592,17117882,18275915,20381322,18940867,10592178	http://cse.unl.edu/∼profess/,http://www.cathdb.info/,http://eggnog.embl.de/,http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/,http://www.essentialgene.org/,http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ligand.html,http://www.rcsb.org/,http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/,http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/5/686.abstract,http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/scop/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/,http://www.cathdb.info/,http://eggnog.embl.de/,http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/,http://www.essentialgene.org/,http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/,http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ligand.html,http://www.rcsb.org/,http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/,http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/5/686.abstract,http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/scop/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/,http://cse.unl.edu/∼profess,http://bionmr-c1.unl.edu/,http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/,http://extjs.com	NULL	NULL	PROFESS	http://cse.unl.edu/∼profess/	database

Duarte,Michael Lappe,Jong Bhak,Dan M. Bolser	NULL	The success of community projects such as Wikipedia has recently prompted a discussion about the applicability of such tools in the life sciences. Currently, there are several such ‘science-wikis’ that aim to collect specialist knowledge from the community into centralized resources. However, there is no consensus about how to achieve this goal. For example, it is not clear how to best integrate data from established, centralized databases with that provided by ‘community annotation’. We created PDBWiki, a scientific wiki for the community annotation of protein structures. The wiki consists of one structured page for each entry in the the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and allows the user to attach categorized comments to the entries. Additionally, each page includes a user editable list of cross-references to external resources. As in a database, it is possible to produce tabular reports and ‘structure galleries’ based on user-defined queries or lists of entries. PDBWiki runs in parallel to the PDB, separating original database content from user annotations. PDBWiki demonstrates how collaboration features can be integrated with primary data from a biological database. It can be used as a system for better understanding how to capture community knowledge in the biological sciences. For users of the PDB, PDBWiki provides a bug-tracker, discussion forum and community annotation system. To date, user participation has been modest, but is increasing. The user editable cross-references section has proven popular, with the number of linked resources more than doubling from 17 originally to 39 today.Database URL:http://www.pdbwiki.org	2010-04-16	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400012&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/404420/PDBWiki-added-value-through-community-annotation	10.1093/database/baq009	10592235,9741847,5891407,5840126,14343300,1167625,14485628,7723011,15032602,17274839,18769412,18945806,18613750,18651794,18507872,18673581,10706254,17090585,18356493,18259167,9787643,11301311,17452350,17727718,18836194,18539779	http://www.pdbwiki.org,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Template:PDB_search,http://www.mediawiki.org,http://semeb.com/dpldemo/index.php?title=Dynamic_Page_List,http://openmms.sdsc.edu,http://pywikipediabot.sourceforge.net,http://Bioinformatics.Org/project/?group_id=936,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Category:PDB_entry_annotation,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Structure_report,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Structure_report,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Structure_report,http://lists.sdsc.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/pdb-l,http://main.uab.edu/Sites/reporter/articles/71570,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Example_annotations,http://www.bioinformatics.org/pipermail/pdbwiki-devel,http://pdbwiki.org/index.php/Development,http://www.mediawiki.org	https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=128&score=3&types=qqqqqqqq	NULL	PDBWiki	http://www.pdbwiki.org	NULL

Associating existing functional annotation of orthologs can speed up the annotation process and even examine the existing annotation. However, current protein sequence-based ortholog databases provide ambiguous and incomplete orthology in eukaryotes. It is because that isoforms, derived by alternative splicing (AS), often share higher sequence similarity to interfere the sequence-based identification. Gene-Oriented Ortholog Database (GOOD) employs genomic locations of transcripts to cluster AS-derived isoforms prior to ortholog delineation to eliminate the interference from AS. From the gene-oriented presentation, isoforms can be clearly associated to their genes to provide comprehensive ortholog information and further be discriminated from paralogs. Aside from, displaying clusters of isoforms between orthologous genes can present the evolution variation at the transcription level. Based on orthology, GOOD additionally comprises functional annotation from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. However, there exist redundant annotations, both parent and child terms assigned to the same gene, in the GO database. It is difficult to precisely draw the numerical comparison of term counts between orthologous genes annotated with redundant terms. Instead of the description only, GOOD further provides the GO graphs to reveal hierarchical-like relationships among divergent functionalities. Therefore, the redundancy of GO terms can be examined, and the context among compared terms is more comprehensive. In sum, GOOD can improve the interpretation in the molecular function from experiments in the model organism and provide clear comparative genomic annotation across organisms.Database URL:http://goods.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/goods/	2010-02-10	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191400005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/403462/Gene-oriented-ortholog-database-a-functional	10.1093/database/baq002	12446146,16285863,10782117,5449325,10802651,19029536,11743721,15608241,16777906,12952885,16381887,17947323,18445630,16845020	http://goods.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/goods/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genomes/,http://genome.ucsc.edu/,http://www.geneontology.org/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene	NULL	NULL	Gene-oriented ortholog database	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene	database

Scalbert	NULL	A number of databases on the plant metabolome describe the chemistry and biosynthesis of plant chemicals. However, no such database is specifically focused on foods and more precisely on polyphenols, one of the major classes of phytochemicals. As antoxidants, polyphenols influence human health and may play a role in the prevention of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, some cancers or type 2 diabetes. To determine polyphenol intake in populations and study their association with health, it is essential to have detailed information on their content in foods. However this information is not easily collected due to the variety of their chemical structures and the variability of their content in a given food. Phenol-Explorer is the first comprehensive web-based database on polyphenol content in foods. It contains more than 37 000 original data points collected from 638 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of these data has been evaluated before they were aggregated to produce final representative mean content values for 502 polyphenols in 452 foods. The web interface allows making various queries on the aggregated data to identify foods containing a given polyphenol or polyphenols present in a given food. For each mean content value, it is possible to trace all original content values and their literature sources. Phenol-Explorer is a major step forward in the development of databases on food constituents and the food metabolome. It should help researchers to better understand the role of phytochemicals in the technical and nutritional quality of food, and food manufacturers to develop tailor-made healthy foods.

High throughput studies have revealed several hundred proteins that are involved in the composition, function or biogenesis of cilia. The corresponding genes are potential candidates for orphan ciliopathies. To study ciliary genes, model organisms are used in which particular questions on motility, sensory or developmental functions can be approached by genetics. In the course of high throughput studies of cilia inParamecium tetraurelia, we were confronted with the problem of comparing our results with those obtained in other model organisms. We therefore developed a novel knowledgebase, Cildb, that integrates ciliary data from heterogeneous sources. Cildb links orthology relationships among 18 species to high throughput ciliary studies, and to OMIM data on human hereditary diseases. The web interface of Cildb comprises three tools, BioMart for complex queries, BLAST for sequence homology searches and GBrowse for browsing the human genome in relation to OMIM information for human diseases.

Médigue	NULL	The initial outcome of genome sequencing is the creation of long text strings written in a four letter alphabet. The role ofin silicosequence analysis is to assist biologists in the act of associating biological knowledge with these sequences, allowing investigators to make inferences and predictions that can be tested experimentally. A wide variety of software is available to the scientific community, and can be used to identify genomic objects, before predicting their biological functions. However, only a limited number of biologically interesting features can be revealed from an isolated sequence. Comparative genomics tools, on the other hand, by bringing together the information contained in numerous genomes simultaneously, allow annotators to make inferences based on the idea that evolution and natural selection are central to the definition of all biological processes. We have developed the MicroScope platform in order to offer a web-based framework for the systematic and efficient revision of microbial genome annotation and comparative analysis (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope). Starting with the description of the flow chart of the annotation processes implemented in the MicroScope pipeline, and the development of traditional and novel microbial annotation and comparative analysis tools, this article emphasizes the essential role of expert annotation as a complement of automatic annotation. Several examples illustrate the use of implemented tools for the review and curation of annotations of both new and publicly available microbial genomes within MicroScope’s rich integrated genome framework. The platform is used as a viewer in order to browse updated annotation information of available microbial genomes (more than 440 organisms to date), and in the context of new annotation projects (117 bacterial genomes). The human expertise gathered in the MicroScope database (about 280,000 independent annotations) contributes to improve the quality of microbial genome annotation, especially for genomes initially analyzed by automatic procedures alone.Database URLs:http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mageandhttp://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microcyc	2009-11-25	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300021&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/358148/MicroScope-a-platform-for-microbial-genome	10.1093/database/bap021	17274839,18849571,18940865,16214803,17933782,15184545,15608211,16381899,19033362,12519973,18940859,12682369,15087310,16855290,11471247,10427000,19561336,16407324,15514110,17130148,10592255,12824403,9023104,17452365,18953034,15980515,12969510,18940856,14602924,9783223,15223320,15501914,12169551,19151095,18077471,11375927,17965431,11471834,17151080,15353568,18845581,18940862,104142,18245282,16381841	http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microcyc,http://www.genomesonline.org,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microcyc,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage,http://www.jboss.org/jbossjbpm,http://biocyc.org/comp-genomics,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/training,http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/publications	NULL	NULL	MicroScope	http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope	platform

The MaizeGDB team endeavors to meet research needs as they evolve based on researcher feedback and guidance. Recent work has focused on better integrating existing data with sequence information as it becomes available for the B73, Mo17 and Palomero Toluqueño genomes. Major endeavors along these lines include the implementation of a genome browser to graphically represent genome sequences; implementation of POPcorn, a portal ancillary to MaizeGDB that offers access to independent maize projects and will allow BLAST similarity searches of participating projects’ data sets from a single point; and a joint MaizeGDB/PlantGDB project to involve the maize community in genome annotation. In addition to summarizing recent achievements and future plans, this article also discusses specific examples of community involvement in setting priorities and design aspects of MaizeGDB, which should be of interest to other database and resource providers seeking to better engage their users.

One of the major steps in this effort was the ‘Dicty annotation marathon’, a week-long exercise with 30 annotators aimed at achieving a major increase in the number ofD. discoideumproteins represented in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The marathon led to the annotation of over 1000D. discoideumproteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Concomitantly, there were a large number of updates in dictyBase concerning gene symbols, protein names and gene models. This exercise demonstrates how UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot can work in very close cooperation with model organism databases and how the annotation of proteins can be accelerated through those collaborations.	2009-10-15	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300016&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/357228/Collaborative-annotation-of-genes-and-proteins	10.1093/database/bap016	11062127,15875012,18836194,18974179,16973001,19435885,18849571	http://www.uniprot.org/,http://www.dictybase.org,http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q54U87?version=28&version=29	NULL	NULL	UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot	http://www.uniprot.org/	NULL

The number of pathogenic viruses is considerably large and their impact in human global health is well documented. Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has classified ∼4379 virus species while the National Center for Biotechnology Information Viral Genomes Resource (NCBI-VGR) database has mapped 617 705 proteins to eight large taxonomic groups. Despite these efforts, an automated approach for mapping the ICTV master list and its officially accepted virus naming to the NCBI-VGR’s taxonomical classification is not available. Due to metagenomic sequencing, it is likely that the discovery and naming of new viral species will increase by at least ten fold. Unfortunately, existing viral databases are not adequately prepared to scale, maintain and annotate automatically ultra-high throughput sequences and place this information into specific taxonomic categories. ORION-VIRCAT is a scalable and interoperable object-relational database designed to serve as a resource for the integration and verification of taxonomical classifications generated by the ICTV and NCBI-VGR. The current release (v1.0) of ORION-VIRCAT is implemented in PostgreSQL and it has been extended to ORACLE, MySQL and SyBase. ORION-VIRCAT automatically mapped and joined 617 705 entries from the NCBI-VGR to the viral naming of the ICTV. This detailed analysis revealed that 399 095 entries from the NCBI-VGR can be mapped to the ICTV classification and that one Order, 10 families, 35 genera and 503 species listed in the ICTV disagree with the the NCBI-VGR classification schema. Nevertheless, we were eable to correct several discrepancies mapping 234 000 additional entries.Database URL:http://www.orionbiosciences.com/research/orion-vircat.html	2009-12-07	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300014&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/356786/ORION-VIRCAT-a-tool-for-mapping-ICTV-and-NCBI	10.1093/database/bap014	18045790,15220402,4329869,9672633,8634029,14681415,15608205,18928197,18251994,17660525,17350350,11125070,17913743,17065465,17537820,17965094,17626595,18086305,15702954,18025038,17108357,16755511,15757512,18025042,17142235,17090593,16381893,16845046,18463140,16309340,18685725,15297293	http://www.orionbiosciences.com/research/orion-vircat.html	NULL	NULL	ORION-VIRCAT	http://www.orionbiosciences.com/research/orion-vircat.html	app

In this article, we describe the development of a quantitative trait loci (QTL) database and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate both the forward and reverse genetics research. The QTL database contains the largest online collection of rice QTL data in the world. Using flanking markers as anchors, QTLs originally reported on individual genetic maps have been systematically aligned to the rice sequence where they can be searched as standard genomic features. Researchers can determine whether a QTL co-localizes with other QTLs detected in independent experiments and can combine data from multiple studies to improve the resolution of a QTL position. Candidate genes falling within a QTL interval can be identified and their relationship to particular phenotypes can be inferred based on functional annotations provided by ontology terms. Mutations identified in functional genomics populations and association mapping panels can be aligned with QTL regions to facilitate fine mapping and validation of gene–phenotype associations. By assembling and integrating diverse types of data and information across species and levels of biological complexity, the QTL database enhances the potential to understand and utilize QTL information in biological research.	2009-05-08	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300005&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/356025/Gramene-QTL-database-development-content-and	10.1093/database/bap005	12481044,16381966,17984077,18533827,16617032,17173058,18533828,17142475,16905665,18628886,17202174,11932250,18194960,17291822,2902517,12580278,10886776,15255870,17559517,17485078,12232127,10047953,18154662,18292984,17717672,17347829,17246026,17209126,12746531,8379002,11244101,12724300,17586829	http://ascus.plbr.cornell.edu/~gramene/qtl_ms/sop/,http://www.maizegdb.org/,http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml,http://www.plantontology.org/,http://gmod.org/wiki/CMap,http://gmod.org/wiki/CMap,http://www.gramene.org/tutorials/QTL_tutorial.pdf,http://www.gramene.org/tutorials/QTL_tutorial.pdf,http://www.gramene.org/pathway/,http://www.gramene.org/plant_ontology/index.html,http://pathway.gramene.org/RICE/server.html?,http://www.rqtl.org/	NULL	NULL	QTL	http://ascus.plbr.cornell.edu/~gramene/qtl_ms/sop/	database

First, CASP targets comprise a realistic sample of currently solved protein structures and exemplify the corresponding challenges for predictors. Second, the plethora of predictions by all possible methods provides an unusually rich material for evolutionary analysis of target proteins. Third, CASP results show the current state of the field and highlight specific problems in both predicting and assessing. Finally, these data can serve as grounds to develop and analyze methods for assessing prediction quality. Here we present results of our analysis in these areas. Our objective is not to duplicate CASP assessment, but to use our unique experience as former CASP5 assessors and CASP8 predictors to (i) offer more insights into CASP targets and predictions based on expert analysis, including invaluable analysis prior to target structure release; and (ii) develop an assessment methodology tailored towards current challenges in the field. Specifically, we discuss preparing target structures for assessment, parsing protein domains, balancing evaluations based on domains and on whole chains, dividing targets into categories and developing new evaluation scores. We also present evolutionary analysis of the most interesting and challenging targets.Database URL:Our results are available as a comprehensive database of targets and predictions athttp://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8.	2009-04-14	http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000208191300003&DestLinkType=RelatedRecords&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=61f30d8ae69c46f86624c5f98a3bc13a	https://academic.oup.com/database/article/355806/Analysis-of-CASP8-targets-predictions-and	10.1093/database/bap003	8710822,15939584,9254694,18000004,15701631,16469879,16777907,10235621,7663343,11159328,12584135,7937738,12021428,12824330,14579328,14579333,17894352,10980157,12547212,18410248,12761065,7577913,11782293,15531603,10908318,11934608,15980461,12055620,8548460	http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8,http://predictioncenter.gc.ucdavis.edu/,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8,http://www.pymol.org,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8/evaluation/Evaluation.htm,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8/evaluation/seqmapping.html,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8/evaluation/DomainsAll.First.html,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8/evaluation_human/DomainsAll.First.html,http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8/evaluation/DomainDefinition.htm,http://robetta.bakerlab.org/CASP8_eval/	NULL	NULL	CASP8	http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP8	NULL
